politics,"The reasoning behind this ruling is that the law prohibits obstructing traffic only for specific purposes.  It doesn't ban going into the street to sell newspapers or flowers or any of the other stuff people sell at traffic lights, just panhandling.

Games,"And that was the point, of course. They did it to make people feel physically uncomfortable, without regard for the fact that mild discomfort for some would be severe discomfort for others.  That's pure arrogance on the production team's part, not to mention laziness.  Why is their little emotional moment so important that they need to resort to making people sick to drive it home, but not so important that they can't find another way to deliver the same scene? Did they think they were the first people to ever discover that strobe effects cause physical discomfort?"
Games,I don't think it specifically mentions epilepsy - that might be a liability issue because reducing the risk doesn't guarantee you won't have a seizure while playing - but WoW lets you turn off its screen flash effects. They've also been using these god-awful full screen swirly effects for a few years now. There are a *ton* of them in the new expac and they've just gotten around to including a checkbox to tone them down.
Games,"I think this is almost certainly more or less what happened. Somebody remembered seeing these headsets that were designed to trigger seizures and thought 'wouldn't it be cool if...'  It's kind of ridiculous to assume that they were designing a headset that was intended to change your state of consciousness and just *happened* to *accidentally* make it just like real devices that real doctors use to trigger real seizures. They just didn't think it though: it didn't occur to them that there are real people who have epilepsy that play video games anyway and thought that the disclaimer meant for effects that might *accidentally* trigger seizures, a risk people with epilepsy manage all the time, would be good enough for a game that mimics an effect that's *designed* to induce them."

wow,I use cursebreaker and it’s pretty good. It’s a little bit more hassle to install things but not much and once they’re installed updating is easy.
YouShouldKnow,"It’s definitely not just an American thing. In fact I once had an English guy go off on me for saying ‘Happy Holidays’ because ‘you Americans are ridiculous!’ But a lot of it in the US is driven by Fox News, which makes the people who would have just been annoyed about it much louder because all that propaganda makes them feel like they’re fighting some kind of noble battle by yelling at people for it."
YouShouldKnow,"This exactly. I say it to cover all the bases, not to avoid offending people, because I don’t know anyone who would be genuinely offended by the ‘wrong’ holiday greeting other than the people who get their panties in a bunch about ‘Happy Holidays.’ And those people are good people to avoid anyway."
wow,"Sweetie, I know plenty about punctuation, and if you know so much about it, why did you include the slashes AND the line breaks? They’re used to indicate line breaks in inline quotes, they’re not an actual inherent part of every poem. If you didn’t know the reference without the slashes, you wouldn’t have known it with them, and you said there was NO punctuation, which isn’t true.  The sentence as written isn’t ungrammatical or missing needed punctuation, it’s just unfinished.   

You’re trying to make this someone else’s fault rather than just saying ‘oh, huh, I didn’t know that.’ It’s sad. You’re sad. Bye, now.   

PS: cramming in all that inflated language and then ending your sentence with a preposition is just :chefkiss:"
wow,"One comma, does, punctuation, make. You said it didn’t make sense because there was no punctuation. I don’t know why you’re being so defensive about this. You didn’t recognize the reference. That’s not that big a deal. I don’t see why you’ve got to make out like OP committed some grave grammatical error as if you *would* have recognized it if only there has been more punctuation. 

You jumped to the conclusion that somebody else was doing English wrong, when in fact what they were saying went over your head. It’s a simple misunderstanding, that’s all."
wow,"Yes, there is punctuation. There’s a comma right there."
wow,What are you missing?
wow,"Yes, it’s a poem, and yes, it does make sense if you know the reference and know what comes next. It’s a poem that used to be commonly taught in English classes."
wow,"The next line is ‘it might have been’ and OP seems to have seen 201/202 prepatch items. I’m not sure what the 202nd one is because I haven’t been that into the prepatch but presumably whatever the rarest item is, OP was disappointed not to get it."
wow,"Have you tried MoveAnything? It’ll let you move and resize elements without reskinning.

Because signature comparison isn't really an exact science even if you're a handwriting expert, which most poll judges are not, they don't toss out ballots where they don't think the signature matches, they just give the voter an opportunity to verify themselves in some other way, and allow a few days after the election to do it.  It's a very common and long-standing practice, it's nothing nefarious, it's just that most of the time elections are not this close and those curable ballots don't effect the outcome."

VXJunkies,"Man that’s going to produce some cool images. You could sell prints. Think about making the prism layers adjustable, it’ll be more flexible if you want to tweak the spectra you’re picking up. Won’t make your results *that* much more informative but it’d be pretty as hell. You could repurpose a guide tube from a PXI analyzer, they’ve got a nice smooth response."
marvelstudios,"I also kind of feel like people forget that the opportunity to challenge the king was basically a formality and while he had to be prepared to fight, nobody really expected him to have to do it. It would be perfectly plausible for Shuri to prove herself in some other way (saving the day with her cyber gauntlet thingies or something) that made the other tribes decide the best thing for Wakanda was to rally around her. She really only has to win over M’Baku, the other tribes thought T’Challa was the natural choice so they could do the same for her."
marvelstudios,"I liked Captain Marvel but other than that I agree on all counts. They better not dare just recast him unless it’s a body double in the costume for a few shots to set up a heroic death. I want to see an on-screen funeral and then a new BP, preferably Shuri because she’s amazing. Give M’Baku something else to do, even give him equal billing alongside her. I love him too but I don’t think the character is suited to taking the BP mantle. The kind of ‘big shoes to fill’ arc they would have with Shuri would make for a great movie.

wow,They’re literally not high elves. If they were they’d be called that. Sorry!
wow,"Blood elves still aren’t high elves. If they were high elves, they’d be *called* that. Lore wise there are at least as many high elves in the Alliance as there are void elves so that excuse doesn’t make sense. It’s not about numbers. It’s about who they *are* as a people. You can want blood elves to be high elves all they want, they just aren’t. They made a choice. They split away from the high elves and became something else. 

And what are you talking about ‘eventually joining the Alliance?’ You *really* need to brush up on your lore."

wow,Man you really need to brush up on your lore. Or just like stroll around Stormwind some time and check out all the *actual* high elves that are still all over the place. Just because *some* former high elves made poor choices that led to them separating themselves from their old faction did not make the actual high elves that stayed behind just go poof.  They're still there. Your blood elf is not one of them anymore.
wow,">High elves left the alliance as a faction prior to WoW and joined the horde. 

Dude no. Blood elves are high elves only in the same sense that void elves are blood elves. There have been actual non-blood elf high elf Alliance NPCs since forever. They’re still an alliance race, they’re just not playable. Your blue eyed blonde haired blood elf is not a high elf."

SapphoAndHerFriend,Well I thought she was meant to be around the same age as most of the rest of them but okay. If Snow White is your issue when Alice is right there I don't know what to tell you.

politics,"Mainly because that's the way we have always done it. The constitution just says it should exist, that the president appoints members, that the Senate advises and consents to those appointees and that justices ""shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office."" It doesn't say how big the court is, or how it hears cases, or even that its job is to throw out laws that it thinks are unconstitutional, and while it doesn't set a term for justices it also doesn't explicitly say term limits can't be set.

wow,"He’s been game director since just after Legion launched. BfA was the first expansion he oversaw, Shadowlands will be his second, and he’s making the same mistakes with covenants that he made with Azerite."
todayilearned,"> He can lightly switch his body, and after decades uses that to try and send a Morse code message to kill him

That’s actually what the protagonist of Metallica’s “One” taps out. The protagonist of *Johnny Got His Gun* taps out a request for his body to be displayed to warn of the consequences of war. He’s informed it would be “against regulations.”"
wow,"People will always pay to swap: if both factions were viable people might even swap back and forth like they used to instead of going Horde and staying there. 

The real reason they won’t do anything about it because Ion likes it this way. “The Horde is there waiting for you!”"
wow,"It doesn’t matter at all for PVP waiting times. That was the only gameplay benefit to playin Alliance over Horde so they of course fixed it years ago. Rated groups could always get paired against teams of any faction, and now you can play mercenary mode for unrated battlegrounds. It mainly impacts players in that it’s much harder to find M+ groups or raids in the group finders, or to find progression guilds to join, because there are far few players forming them."
wow,"It took patch after patch of imbalanced racials for guilds to transfer. It’s not an easy thing to coordinate So they’re not going to do it lightly. As it is now, with the talent pool so heavily weighted towards horde, you’re not likely to see guilds narrowly losing progression races because somebody else had better racials even if Alliance racials were seriously overpowered. The incentive just isn’t going to be there. Cross faction grouping is the only way to give the whole player base access to high end content, and it’s fairer than just flipping the abysmal racial design That got us here to begin with."
wow,"I mean it would definitely happen. It would also be a very good signal to most players regardless of faction that they’re better off if they just keep scrolling. Let the folks who think the faction you choose says something more important about you than the spec you play or the content you’re doing play how they want, it’s no great loss to the rest of us."
wow,"Yep. Fast unrated battleground queues was pretty much the only advantage to playing Alliance. Mercenary mode only benefits Horde players and likely contributed to the downward slide of the Alliance population. Cross faction PVE would mainly benefit Alliance players. But for some reason one was an easy decision despite making *less* sense lore wise, while even though we regularly have storylines where horde and alliance work together to take on PVE threats the other is a hard line they will never ever cross because “The faction conflict is at the heart of the game! It’s World of WARcraft!”"

YouShouldKnow,"It’s also a better controlled program that they’re using to offer more products in the store than they would otherwise, not one like Amazon’s or Wal Mart’s where anybody can sign up, send in a case of shampoo sourced from parts unknown, and have it shipping out to unsuspecting customers the next day."
YouShouldKnow,"Yeah, project zero is some bullshit. They’re putting the burden on brands to create serial numbers for individual products so that they can keep on taking products from any old seller and tossing them all in the same bin, depriving consumers of the opportunity to decide whether to buy a product from a reputable seller or a disreputable one. They want every tube of toothpaste and bottle of vitamins to have its own unique code because they *don’t* want to be honest and transparent with their customers about where the product they’re being shipped actually came from."
Foodforthought,"It’s not about training. Cops get plenty of training. It’s about mindset. EMTs dedicate their lives to saving the lives of others. Cops dedicate their lives to exerting control over civilians, and are empowered to use deadly force as the first line of defense against anything that feels vaguely threatening to them personally."
casualiama,"Keep telling yourself that. Police violence is a problem for everyone. It's unacceptably high for every demographic group, and disproportionately high for Black people. Meanwhile being a cop is not a particularly dangerous job. The numbers don't lie. Go look them up instead of just assuming being a cop is more dangerous than being a civilian stopped by a cop.  It's all there."
casualiama,"> The whole point of them doing the math was showing that for the same amount of interactions percentage wise the white man gets killed more by police than the black man

Incorrect. Even when we *just* look at firearms deaths, unarmed and innocent Black folks are more likely to be killed than white folks.  And that doesn't even cover people like George Floyd and Elijah McClain and Ramon Lopez, who were murdered with nothing but a shithead cop's bare hands.  


> Also Floyd was a POS convicted felon that was high as hell. 

Incorrect, but also I didn't realize that carried the death penalty, let alone that cops had licence to serve as judge jury and executioner on the spot. 

>Do you know how many cops are killed each year and they are just trying to protect the public.    

Yes, I do know how many cops die on the job a year, and given that you seem to think it's a horrifyingly high number I kind of wonder if *you* know. It's about 100 most years.  About half of those most years are accidental deaths such as car crashes. This means that in literally any given interaction between a cop and a civilian, the civilian is at more risk than the cop. The civilian has to react perfectly at all times despite no training no matter how terrified they are. The cop is liable to get a pass on literal murder because they 'felt threatened.'  

Cops are given high salaries, extensive training, and military grade equipement to protect themselves from their supposedly dangerous job. Meanwhile they're not even in the top ten dangerous jobs in the country.  Being a delivery driver is more dangerous.  Being a landscaper is more dangerous. Being a nurse is more dangerous.  But we give cops licence to murder anyone they even think *might* hurt them."
casualiama,"That's simply not true. Do you understand how proportions work? There are more white people, so there *should* be more white people dying of any given cause of death, whether it's violence or heart disease or anything else.  That's how math works.  

So again, go ahead and hold a protest about it if you'd like, but don't fool yourself into thinking that being white is more dangerous in the US than being Black.  When you're only one person, what matters isn't the raw number of people of your race, gender, age etc who die of a given cause. What matters is your *risk*, as determined by the *rate at which* people in your circumstances die of that cause. I'm not the one who's only paying attention to what 'fits my narrative.'"
casualiama,"Again, you need to learn your history. The phrase “highly doubt” says it all: you’re basing this on what you assume to be true, what feels right, but haven’t spent any time learning anything but the most superficial and whitewashed versions of the civil rights movement. Have you ever heard the phrase “good trouble?” It didn’t mean staying out of the way.  

I’m not going to spoon feed you. Go study up or stop telling other people what MLK did or didn’t do."
casualiama,You have *no clue* what you are talking about. Do you know who John Lewis is? Did you know that he was nearly beaten to death at a protest? Do you know where he was when he was nearly beaten to death?
casualiama,"How can you see this as a retort to what I'm saying? Crime happens to all races and all demographics, and there is a uniform nationwide sentiment that crime is bad. State sponsored violence against unarmed and innocent people happens massively disproportionately to some races over others, and there is a heavy partisan bias in *favor* of protecting the shitty cops who perpetrate it. So feel free to organize a protest against crime if you like, but there's a very good reason why police violence attracts so much more protest than crime in general does and it's not because nobody cares about the victims of crime."
casualiama,"Learn your history, you silly person."
pics,Pandemic means it’s basically everywhere.
casualiama,"> Just one thing: Inconveniencing the general public who may or may not have cared about your cause is a very surefire way to delegitimize a movement.

Tell that to Martin Luther King dude. Nobody ever won equal rights without inconveniencing *voters,* not just the people they elect. 

Innocent people are dying at the hands of police. It just keeps happening with no end in sight,  Anyone who’s going to turn against a movement to end police violence because it took them a little longer to get to fucking Applebee’s was never a potential ally to begin with."

todayilearned,"I do understand what detracts means. It does not detract. Their claim is no less ironclad just because some native people did bad things. There isn’t a race or people on earth that hasn’t produced at least a few villains.  Consider that maybe these incidents don’t get the attention you believe they deserve because they pale (hah) in comparison to the ones inflicted upon indigenous peoples by colonists. 

But you did in fact ‘take a stance on the matter’ when you said: 

> Part of the reason it’s stupid as fuck to care about Native land rights. They were conquerors as well, they just got conquered and now woke people today think it’s wrong.

As I explained, ‘conquered’ or no, their ‘conquerors’ agreed to give them certain land rights. Those agreementS were passed through Congress, have not been repealed, and so are still in force. It’s pretty simple! Whether you think the ‘conquest’ was right or wrong, the treaties are still there and we should be following them.  

We’re just two people disagreeing, so I’m not sure why I’m the one who ‘wants something to be mad at’ when you’re the one saying asking the US to follow its own laws even when it comes to native land rights is ‘stupid as fuck.’"
todayilearned,"> detracts from native rights movements today 


Oh like fuck it does. The US made treaties with them that were passed through Congress and never repealed. The fact that some guy got flayed alive before they were even signed does not absolve US of the responsibility to hold up its end of the (pretty piss poor on the whole) bargain.  

The reservation in Oklahoma, for example, was the destination of the mother fucking trail of tears. ‘Conquerors’ or no, the US sent people on a forced march with the promise they could live on some other land when they got there, and congress passed that treaty into law, so that land belongs to them now. That land is theirs by law until Congress takes action to change that. The white supremacists probably could have passed a repeal once, but they missed their chance, and we all know it’s not happening today. So all these ‘woke’ people are doing is asking the US to obey its own laws. The nerve! 

Talk all you want about bad things some Native Americans did (as if the white colonizers were such angels!) It won’t make that land *not* theirs. Congress agreed to that on the US’s behalf many years ago, and just because the US conveniently forgot for a while doesn’t change any of it."

wow,"No, you're fine, it's the flair that usually goes on this sort of thing, we just need more flairs imo."
wow,"Congrats to you both! It's awesome you get to play with your dad! 

Anyway this isn't fluff imo, it's the whole reason why we play this game.  We need a better flair for 'killing monsters together' stuff like this."
harrypotterwu,"I'm an auror. I knock out 'Kill X Enemies' tasks in low level chambers with event runes, which I always have too many of anyway, so when I get knocked out and the magizoologist snipes my kill instead of reviving me it doesn't raise my blood pressure. When I'm doing a high chamber I don't want to have to think about anything but making sure the team succeeds. It's bad enough that teammates are doing this, but i don't want to make it worse by changing the way I play, too. 

Maybe they could fix this by putting 'do high level chambers/get lots of challenge xp' tasks in different steps from the 'kill lots of enemies' ones? If people aren't trying to get it all done at once they may be more likely to finish it off in a more efficient way rather than wasting the team's time by kill sniping in high chambers. Or replace 'kill this many enemies' with 'do this much damage to enemies?' Or 'cast this many damaging spells on enemies,' so it's fair between different profs?"
wow,"> nor likely experience often themselves as I doubt many of the people making them game play PUGs.

All the leads need to spend at least two hours a week playing the game as an anonymous nobody. They can play in a guild so long as nobody in it knows who they are, and they can pug with the same rules. That's it. No bnet friends no character names linked to their work, so no chance of people being even a *little* nicer to them because they know who they are. Ideally this should be the main way they experience the game but at a minimum they need to spend a few hours a week slumming it on secret alts."
todayilearned,"So they accidentally made literal slavery legal as a punishment for a crime instead? If they’d wanted a cutout for prisons but not for forced prison labor they could have written one. They knew exactly what they were doing. In fact some plantations simply converted to using prison labor, and newly freed people were arrested for minor crimes and enslaved again."

wow,"Just let the covenants be all about the fun, immersive, RP/flavor/cosmetic choices and tie your access to player power abilities to your progression in them but not to the specific one you chose. Now they’re actually fun *and* we still have an incentive to invest in them if we’re only motivated by minmaxxing. Simple."
harrypotterwu,"Yeah, none of this seems to have anything to do with fortresses except the potions bonus. Too bad. It'd be cool to have a charm to cast on fortresses to maybe make special enemies appear or increase your team's chance of getting rare fragments. Could give people a reason to use fortresses out in the world again instead of the knight bus, but maybe they're saving it until people are under fewer travel restrictions."
