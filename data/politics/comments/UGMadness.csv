gaming,I personally think it's so long it overstays its welcome tbh. The midgame can become mind bogglingly repetitive.
shittyfoodporn,Sometimes I like the taste of tortilla more than chips tbh.
hardware,"IBM had already conducted tests of 50GHz+ transistors back in the late 2000s, so it wasn't a crazy assumption that CPUs would scale that high in frequency in the near future."
astralchain,"Hopefully, we get a 60fps mode for the sequel, it was the only stumbling point for me."
hardware,"I might actually look into getting one of these. Looking to retire my Ryzen 1700 on my desktop to move it to a server and because it doesn't come with an integrated GPU I was looking to add a cheap graphics card but it's extra bulk that I really didn't want to add as many cases don't have space for a proper GPU. Alternatively, I'd also want to add an extra SATA controller card on the lone PCIe slot (motherboard is ITX). I don't need an NVMe drive for this use so this device will be a good use for that otherwise unused port."
Zoomies,My mum used to make the meals for our dog and she used to joke that we had a hair making machine that processed chicken breasts into hair.
politics,To her voters they are.
politics,"The worst thing is that she *knows* her tactic works. Just attack the person again and again and repeat ""radical liberal"" enough times to hammer in the idea that Warnock is a dirty commie."
hardware,"I mean, the Xbox One S has like what, 1/3 the power of a GTX1060? And many of these cross gen titles are very CPU intensive. 

I'm not getting my hopes very high but I still think it will be able to become playable at 1080p and maybe with 80% resolution scaling to hit 60fps."
hardware,The game is going to be released on the Xbox/PS4 consoles so I imagine it will run just fine at 1080p medium or even medium-high settings on a 1060 equivalent card. Or at least that's what I'm telling myself so I don't spend $500 on a graphics card I won't use for any other game in the foreseeable future.
hardware,"Just like with Ice Lake, IPC gains might be realised on the same node and power draw by reducing the frequency they operate at, so overall performance per watt improvements won't be very high even if IPC sees double-digit improvements as they appear to be on this new uarch."
hardware,"They changed it on laptops for their Icelake parts onwards as it represented a new uarch and process node. I imagine they will do the same once 10nm arrives on desktop, whenever that is.

If anything, the current naming scheme reduces confusion as it implies that these parts are still related in some way to the previous gen ones, which is true for the process node used."
SuperMetroid,"The US and Japanese ROMs are exactly the same. That's why the US cartridge has an option to set Japanese captions.

What he needs is an unheadered ROM."
emulation,"That FPGA die is massive! I'm surprised it sells for as low as $220, these are highly specialised products and it's as big as a high end graphics card die."
Roms,"I've been using these for years and they've been a pain to maintain, especially with adjusting the laser potentiometer and available mini DVD-Rs being progressively worse in quality as production shuts down.

Finally got a GCLoader a few months ago and couldn't be happier. It instantly saved myself from all these headaches and the bulk of keeping around a stack of discs."
emulation,VMWare Workstation supports 3D hardware acceleration so running XP games on a virtual machine can work quite well for the vast majority of contemporary applications. It recently also added support for integer scaling so you can run 1024x768 or 800x600 titles on a high resolution modern display without it looking like a stretchy and blurry mess.
emulation,"Just a question, what are these hardware device ROMs? The graphics card BIOS?"
hardware,I still own nearly all the processors of the PCs I've had over the years! The only one I've actually lost was a Phenom II X2 550 as it was my college dorm PC and didn't make the move with me when I graduated. From the Pentium II 350MHz of my family PC to the last CPU I decommissioned (an i5-2380P) before building my current PC. I plan on doing something similar someday.
hardware,"I like LTT ""reviews"" for shiny new stuff because I don't need very precise data as there's no chance in hell I'll buy whatever is being ""reviewed"" anytime soon, I just want to see how it works and in that regard, Linus is alright in explaining and providing the gist of it. If I'm going to buy a product I'll go watch the 45-minute long chartfests of GamersNexus and Hardware Unboxed."
hardware,"Ethereum has been ""moving"" to PoS for the past 3 years. Just like healthcare reform, it's one of those things that will always be ""2 weeks away"" in order to keep people hopeful but will never actually arrive as it will sink interest and demand from the very people they rely on keeping prices up, the miners and speculators."
oneplus,"The camera is low end bottom tier and OnePlus has already stated the N100 will only get one major Android version update (to Android 11) despite shipping it with Android 10 months after 11's release.

The low end SoC that's comes with the phone is really underpowered and running the phone at the advertised 90Hz refresh rate is a less than ideal experience.

Pretty much the only positive aspect of the phone is the battery life and there are better options on the market for that on the same price segment."
oneplus,Always has been
hardware,"I use a 60Hz 4K monitor and a 144Hz 1080p one. It used to stutter a lot before the Windows 10 20H1 release earlier this year. I had to reduce the refresh rate to 120Hz to minimise the stutter as it was caused by the OS not having separate framebuffers for each monitor. They have been resolved with WDDM 2.7 and the corresponding graphics card drivers that make use of the new driver model, so you should have no issues with it.

Make sure you have the higher refresh rate monitor as your primary monitor though, most apps will run at the same refresh rate as your primary monitor and if that one's 60Hz it will stutter as ir desyncs on a 144Hz screen, aside from defeating the purpose of a high refresh rate monitor in the first place. Web browsers and Electron based apps are the worst offenders of this, so if you want buttery smooth scrolling you have to set the 144Hz screen as primary."
hardware,">Every time I want to upgrade my PC there’s one part that costs an outrageous amount of money.

People will always have roughly the same amount of money for a new build and supply isn't uniform across all components. The cheaper some components are the more people will want to build a new PC and the more demand there will be for the components with lower supply."
oneplus,"Oppo has always used Oneplus to gain a foothold in the West and now that they don't need the brand anymore they're kneecapping it in favour of actual, more profitable Oppo branded devices.

The shift became apparent the moment the US shot down Huawei from the skies and an opening in the market became available."
3DS,The Japanese release is more affordable but yeah still not easy to find.
3DS,"That particular release comes with an English option too, so you don't have to worry about the language barrier."
3DS,"Azure Striker Gunvolt: Striker Pack

It's the Japanese cover which looks very different than the Western release."
3DS,Only on PC :3c
3DS,The Japanese logo is so much more cool looking!
3DS,"It's a lifetime obsession \^\^"""
3DS,"It's a Katsukitty board too! It was bought as a loose kit then installed by a local shop, they did a really good job with the mini USB port cutout and the board sits perfectly flush inside the case."
3DS,It's not a viable method for speedrunning due to the CPU running faster than it should for non n3DS exclusive games and the image quality is very poor. It also doesn't support capturing in NTR mode. It's a nice stopgap but for archival gameplay footage or accurate timing you need an actual capture device.
3DS,"Futari Wa PreCure - Splash Star Panpaka Game De Zekkouchou!

It's a collection of minigames based on the PreCure franchise, got it as a throw in deal with other games but it's still pretty fun albeit easy, as it's targeted towards a younger audience."
3DS,"It's a modded 3DS with a capture card, basically a module with a USB port that can output video to a PC. It's used for streaming and recording NDS/3DS game footage as these consoles have no official means to do so."
Gamecube,"I'll look into it, thanks! Sucks that I would need another Raphnet adapter because they take so damn long to ship to where I live :("
hardware,"I tried a S20 FE and the plastic back surprised me with how little it feels like plastic. It has a matte finish and it's really solidly mounted to the chassis so there's zero flex. Really reminded me of sandstone textured ceramics more than anything to do with plastic.

I really wouldn't mind owning a phone with that material in the back, especially given I use cases anyways. Glossy polycarbonate can go die in a fire though."
hardware,"He often gets sent high resolution scans from third parties of components that are beyond the budget of most people. All it takes is for someone who appreciates Buildzoid's work to also have access to a naked PCB of this thing, which isn't going to be easy but not impossible."
Gamecube,Would you mind sharing the list of components that would have to be daisy chained? I don't think I would pay that much but there's a reasonable chance I already have some of the stuff needed so please do tell \^\^
Gamecube,"If you have a Game Boy Player, then GameBoy Interface is a must. It improves image quality over the official disc significantly while being much more configurable. It allows you to apply gamma fixes, anamorphic widescreen options for playing GB/GBA games on modern widescreen LCDs with a GC-Video HDMI adapter, low latency modes for speedrunning, etc."
politics,"I had an American worker living in China remark to me about the high number of ""African Americans"" in the country.

We were in a city popular with actual African businesspeople."
furry_irl,Approved
hardware,"At this point the iPad Pro is just an iPad Air with a 120Hz screen and lidar. They really need to lower the price to something more realistic.

But knowing Apple I'm not getting my hopes up."
hardware,The people who genuinely love Apple or have used their products for so long that don't really consider alternatives aren't usually the kind of people who pay attention to consumer electronics to such a degree that they engage in technology related subreddits.
hardware,"It's normal for companies to still work with each other years after they're separated, you don't get a new supply chain overnight and it's in fact in their best interest to keep each other afloat especially when a vertically integrated company breaks up and creates entities that don't compete directly with each other. AMD works with GlobalFoundries to this day despite it being spun off more than a decade ago. Keep in mind that most of these corporate restructuring decisions are made with financial considerations in mind and not because they hate each other."
oneplus,Samsung has really got their software act together lately. Still not ideal as they continue to push their duplicated apps and their phones have a healthy amount of bloatware apps depending on the region but the commitment to 3 years of major updates is a huge selling point. Haven't bought a Samsung Android product since the Tab S2 but they're definitely at the top of my list for my next device.
hardware,"I mean, it doesn't cost them much to launch a 6900XT as a gaming card in addition to its main professional/workstation use. It's a halo product that serves more of a PR role showcasing AMD's tech than a real commercially viable product.

It's good for AMD to have it in their lineup even if it barely breaks even at $1000 and nobody can actually get one at MSRP due to extremely limited supply."

hardware,"The 5700XT didn't have raytracing capabilities, and that was a big feature in Nvidia's favour. What would anyone get a card that has similar performance at the same price when the competition has way more features?"
Huawei,"I have the 4600H model and the CPU runs very cool indeed, even under load. I've never heard it spin up significantly outside my initial torture test I did shortly after buying it.

Keep in mind that the iGPU on the Renoir CPUs are very low power, and the main power draw, the CPU cores themselves, aren't heavily taxed during gaming."
Huawei,"I have a P9 and it got an update recently that applied the July 2020 Android security patch. It's nothing more than that.

No new features are being added to these older phones anymore but they're still receiving security updates albeit intermittently. In any case you can see what each patch contains in the update page on your phone, there's a changelog displayed there before you confirm."
DeathAndTaxesMTG,"Clique is insanely powerful with a Vial and Karakas too, more so than TNN wielding an equipment in many matchups such as control.

The downside of the build was the heavy reliance on double blue mana costed cards, so the mana base is a bit constrained, you ideally need 12+ blue sources, which my list split into 4 fetchlands (and 1 basic Island), 4 Seachrome Coast and 4 Tundras, leaving no space for Ports. So that's a tradeoff you'll have to consider if you want to run these cards. Seachrome Coast might seem like an unorthodox choice but it's long been a good option for an untapped dual land that doesn't cost life like a shockland would, and I think it's still the best UW land around after Flooded Strand and Tundra for this deck."

HHKB,I had a BT and ended up changing it to a Pro 2 Type-S because the issue was getting incredibly annoying to the point of unusability. What I suspect happened was that my desktop PC's Bluetooth antenna was too far away from the keyboard and the keyboard had signal issues. It never happened with my Android tablet when used side by side by comparison. Since the BT has a very long battery life with just two AAs while replacement dongles and modules have much higher power requirements that's my leading hypothesis.
hardware,"From the article:
> In a nutshell: The Intel Core i9-10885H has been found running 20 percent slower than expected in Dell Precision laptops, capping its clock speed at just 2.7GHz. Most likely down to the limited cooling in this entry-level Dell device, this is a reminder to consumers and professionals to investigate performance in laptops and PC builds as a whole before investing in them."

politics,Because the list of approved domains arose from a need to tackle spam and that's its purpose. We are not content curators and honestly it's not in the userbase's best interests to have a bunch of anonymous moderators do that job.
politics,"Hey there, I apologise if my answer was unsatisfactory, I just wanted to convey that the whitelist wasn't created as a content curation tool, and that the correct way to approach misinformation is by applying Reddit's sitewide policies and procedures regarding such content. 

[The announcement for the whitelisting system](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6r5q2s/announcement_rpolitics_is_moving_to_a_whitelist/) has a handy FAQ and explanation for the purpose of it as mainly an anti spam measure."
politics,"Given the very limited visibility of such domains in the subreddit we trust the few users who happen to see them in the 'New' page to be able to exercise their best judgment when gauging the value and trustfulness of the content therein.

We do have policies in place to deal with COVID-19 disinformation that align with Reddit's sitewide stance on the matter and we regularly act on their enforcement."
politics,This isn't a measure we are currently taking into consideration.
politics,"Hey there, another mod has already [given an answer to a similar question](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/j990w2/october_2020_metathread/g8iy184/)  earlier today:
> Saying something like ""Who in their right mind cares that x got covid"" or ""I wouldn't care if x had a stroke"" or similar is basically just another way of saying "" I hope harm befalls x""

> That's what we imply by 'extreme indifference', it's basically just other ways of letting everyone know how x deserves harm in someone's view.

> If you're just indifferent to the situation, like you're commenting on something else entirely that's fine. It's not like we ever require people to say something similar to "" I hope x gets well soon, but I disagree with their policy/belief on this issue"". You can just talk about the issue.

> We try to make our rules unambiguous and clear cut without complicated exceptions because there are more than enough rules and complexities to think about. Hopefully the totality of rules just amounts to ""as long as I'm showing basic decency, I won't ever have to worry about reading the rules"".

> In my view, that's probably not exactly how it feels to some. It's not like we want muddy, unclear rules that feels like they're hard to understand. At the same time, we don't want a huge codified volume of rules that feels impenetrable."
politics,"Weekly scheduled posts, AMAs and discussion threads need to be pinned because of the need for them to be visible during the time they're relevant for, which is what I assume you're referring to as a 'Megathread'. These weekly threads have a modest but dedicated community of users who are interested in them even if you feel they're not for you. Even if they're not breaking news, they're still valuable information and discussion for those who want it.

Megathreads are a specific type of post we use to collate breaking news that would otherwise overwhelm the content in our frontpage and they take a pinned slot just like the others but aren't related."
politics,"Hey there, there are a lot of subreddits that discuss politics from the viewpoint of specific ideologies and leanings, there's going to be some bias in all of them but feel free to reference them to learn from a variety of sources, here are some of them that you can get started with:

* r/PoliticalDiscussion
* r/Ask_Politics
* [r/NeutralPolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics)

* [r/changemyview](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview)
* [r/Moderatepolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Moderatepolitics)

politics,"The Canadian flag shows correctly on the Reddit redesign, official mobile client and on any third party clients that pull their data from it. We will look into how to make that happen on Old Reddit, thanks for the feedback."
politics,"Another mod has already [answered a similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/j990w2/october_2020_metathread/g8ij2ys?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) earlier today:

>This  has come up a few times and we're certainly open to discussion, but as a  guiding principle, we generally try to avoid implementing rules that  have too much subjectivity involved. In the present case, are you saying  we should stop allowing articles only where a celebrity is opining on a  politician? If so, who are the people who we would tolerate an opinion  on politics from? Everyone else? Just politicians? If it's everyone  else, then how do we judge who is and isn't enough of a celebrity? If  it's just politicians, how do we decide whether someone is a politician  (eg. is it the standard we use for topicality, or is it a broader one  that includes superPAC heads and what not?), and how do we decide if a  celebrity who is also a political activist is speaking in their capacity  as a celebrity vs being a political activist?  
>  
>This  isn't to pour cold water on the idea, but it illustrates the kinds of  questions that come up whenever we change a rule. While there are  invariably situations where moderators have to make a call on something  that's potentially subjective, we generally try to avoid it where  possible, because otherwise we're opening ourselves up to a lot of  complaints in modmail and accusations of bias."

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,">So, who the hell are ya? Whats your story?

I'm a chemical engineer and EU expat living in the Far East, small time speedrunner, MTG player and retro game connoisseur, and I have the Big Gæ.

>Why do you want to mod [r/traa](https://www.reddit.com/r/traa/)?

I really appreciate how wholesome the community is, and how helpful it was back when I needed it, so I would be grateful to be given the chance to give back to the community.

>Do you have previous modding experience, or any other skills that would contribute to the sub?

Yes, I currently mainly mod r/furry_irl, r/politics and r/worldnews, all of them with full permissions, among other subreddits. I have ample experience moderating subreddits and have a deep understanding of the sitewide guidelines and rules enforcement, plus Automod config. I also have extensive experience moderating Telegram groups.

>What time zone are you in? and what are your active hours? (If possible, please answer your active times both from your time zone and from UTC. (Central? whats easier here) That will make it easier for us to compare!)

UTC+8, active hours are usually 15:00 to 0:00 local time, so I guess 7:00 to 16:00 hours UTC.

>How active are you on reddit, and how often do you think you will be able to perform mod duties?

I peruse the site and do modqueue pretty much every day, plus taking care of modmail when available. I also do a lot of behind the scenes work such as coordinating policy and discussion among mods.

>If you could improve the sub in one way, what would it be?

This is a very complex question that I feel will only be answered once I'm more familiar with how things are behind the scene. Nothing outwardly concerning.

>Got anything else that you think would help you offer unique perspectives to the team? (i.e. if you are disabled, a POC, you're from someplace we don't see represented much around here, you're religious, whatever!)

I'm a furry I guess? Also POC, travel for a living, and currently work and live in underrepresented places from an LGBT+ perspective.

>Did you read and answer all the questions? cause like, we probably wont go for ya if your application consists of ""throwing my hat into the ring!"". Ya gotta read things all good like.

Aye

>Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?

Aye

>Do you have at least 3 years experience in a non managerial position?

Aye

>What?

I prefer not to reveal in a public comment.

shittyfoodporn,"That's because for much of history, garlic was considered a food for the poor, so anyone who regularly ate garlic was considered to come from a lower class.

The only exception being the British who simply hate eating food that has any flavour in it."

retrogaming,The White JP Saturn is legit one of the sexiest consoles ever released. The controller it came with is also amazing.
retrogaming,"Yup, those are GBCs alright."
3DS,You can run NDS and GBA games natively on any 3DS by using NDS Bootstrap and GBARunner. It does require homebrew access though.
3DS,The VB does have a couple pretty good games. I think Nintendo is just embarrassed the library is so small and they'd just rather keep the console dead and buried.

travel,"Pepper spray will do nothing as the cockpit is already locked at all times and always with someone present inside to prevent hijackers from seizing control of the aircraft.

Hijackers usually threaten the lives of the passengers instead of crew to coerce the pilots into doing their bidding, pepper spray or firearms in the hands of the pilots will do nothing to stop that kind of behaviour. Pilots are already trained to give in to hijackers' demands if passenger lives are at risk, such as by diverting to an airport of the hijacker's choice, but they're also trained to not allow hijackers access to the cockpit no matter what happens."

furry_irl,"Hello! Your [submission](https://i.redd.it/7s6tbgej9pl51.jpg) was removed for the following reasons:


**This is an “_irl” subreddit. All posts should be titled “furry_irl”**

Posts must stand on their own without the title to explain them. If your post doesn't make sense if it is named ""furry_irl"" it will be removed. If in doubt or it gets auto removed, title your post ""furry_irl"".

Titles can contain any **one real SFW word**, of at most 14 characters, followed by one non-alphanumeric character (multi-character emojis are supported), followed by the letters ""irl"".

For more information, check out the rule in the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/wiki/rules#wiki_this_is_an_.201C_irl.201D_subreddit._all_posts_should_be_titled_.201Cfurry_irl.201D).

If this is the only removal reason, your post is fine!  Feel free to repost with an appropriate title.

**All furry content must be relatable or a meme**

Your submission was removed for not containing a clearly relatable or meme/joke context.

* Furry artwork and merchandise with no other context, that normally wouldn't be considered a ""meme"". Examples include unedited comics that aren't memes, ref sheets, commissioned artwork of your fursona, group photos in a con, furry related decals on laptops/cars/etc., video game or phone screenshots, etc.

furry_irl,"Hello! Your [submission](https://i.redd.it/31uh0d4yvjl51.jpg) was removed for the following reasons:


**This is an “_irl” subreddit. All posts should be titled “furry_irl”**

Posts must stand on their own without the title to explain them. If your post doesn't make sense if it is named ""furry_irl"" it will be removed. If in doubt or it gets auto removed, title your post ""furry_irl"".

Titles can contain any **one real SFW word**, of at most 14 characters, followed by one non-alphanumeric character (multi-character emojis are supported), followed by the letters ""irl"".

For more information, check out the rule in the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/wiki/rules#wiki_this_is_an_.201C_irl.201D_subreddit._all_posts_should_be_titled_.201Cfurry_irl.201D).

If this is the only removal reason, your post is fine!  Feel free to repost with an appropriate title.

**All furry content must be relatable or a meme**

Your submission was removed for not containing a clearly relatable or meme/joke context.

* Furry artwork and merchandise with no other context, that normally wouldn't be considered a ""meme"". Examples include unedited comics that aren't memes, ref sheets, commissioned artwork of your fursona, group photos in a con, furry related decals on laptops/cars/etc., video game or phone screenshots, etc.

If you haven't done a factory restore since getting the console it's always recommended to do it as it might have another person's NNID linked to it. Unless of course they sold you the console with digital purchases included in the package in which case you'd lose them if you reset."

flashcarts,"All of those consoles have really good flashcarts available. For the NES you might want to research which mappers do the games you want to play have and which the flashcart supports. All of them should work for 99% of the games. 

For the SNES get a SD2SNES.

Experience is exactly the same as playing with a real cartridge, just plug it in and select the ROM you want to run a d it should behave exactly like a real cartridge should as you're playing on real hardware.

A huge advantage of using a flashcart is that you can play enhancement hacks of old games that the community has developed, featuring everything from fixed translations, better game balance, fixed bugs, etc. to bring the games more on par with the quality we expect today and to maintain the rose tinted glasses with which we remember old games with none of the ugly. You can also run translated versions of games that never came to the West too. There are a ton of possibilities besides just running regular game ROMs."

emulation,"Allow for fan modifications to add support for more features, maps, performance etc. Stuff like mouse and light gun support, bigger ROM size to restore the full contents of the PC game that were cut from the retail release due to budget constraints, even a possible SA-1 enhancement to make the game run even faster on original hardware since it was mentioned in the video that the console's puny 5A22 CPU was a crippling bottleneck even with the GSU-2 doing most of the heavy lifting.

It's much easier for the community to work with original source code than to try to reverse engineer it from decompiled code like most old enhancement hacks are developed."

Might be worth testing whether having the BT receiver on the front of the PC closer to you rather than on the back panel might help."
HHKB,"I had that with my HHKB BT, and it was common enough that I ended up returning it and getting a Pro 2 Type-S.

I've built a ton of PCs over the past two decades and I used to be very knowledgeable for a few years, being a proper ""enthusiast"". But from the Sandy Bridge to Skylake era I had no idea whatsoever about the latest trends and models as I had more concerning matters in my life. Had to do *a lot* of research over the course of multiple weeks to get up to date when I finally decided to buy a new PC in 2017.

nottheonion,"Chinese, Japanese and Korean people can understand CJK characters (hanzi, kanji, hanja, however you want to call it) all the same. The symbols all mean the same in any language, that's how the writing system works, its meaning is detached from the language it's being used in. They can be pronounced differently and have different grammatical uses in each language, but the inherent meaning of the characters all stay very consistent.

So a Japanese person can go to China and be able to understand most of the writing, but will be unable to speak or listen to any of it in Chinese as they only know the Japanese reading. Vice versa with Chinese people reading Japanese. You can read the kanji and glean most of what each sentence is trying to say, even if you have no idea about the hiragana and katakana used."
speedrun,"Component to HDMI using an OSSC would be ideal, both in image quality and input lag."
emulation,">the real reason they were blurry was because they took insanely small textures then forced anti-aliasing on them.

The assets were insanely small and compressed because they had to fit inside the tiny texture cache. Which was 4KB big. That's a drop even in the relatively small ocean that was the cartridge ROM.

ROM size hampered other aspects of the game, such as cutscenes (which were either compressed to the extreme such as in RE2, or eliminated completely in ports to the N64), and audio, which couldn't compete with systems that used Red Book audio.

Most CD titles of that era had almost all of their disc capacity occupied by FMVs or audio tracks, not actual in-game graphical assets such as textures and models."
emulation,"The blurry textures issue has more to do with the severe cost cutting measures Nintendo did to limit the texture cache in the graphics processor, forcing developers to compress textures to an extreme degree. Mitigation techniques such as mipmapping were also not possible (or very hard to do). Textures didn't take a lot of space even in CD based systems as the bottlenecks of the era were the system memory access time and cache size, not storage. The PSX relied on flat shaded polygons whenever possible to improve performance despite having entire CDs worth of storage space."
emulation,"People hate me for saying this but when I was a wee lad I didn't enjoy that game because it was so hard to navigate around the endless expanse of blurry shades of green and brown, and we didn't even have a bad or small TV. Left me a bad taste of the N64 in general."

evilbuildings,"Such a building doesn't actually need to be a hotel, it can be repurposed for government or office use, for example.

Environmental concerns on the capital Ulan Bator are growing increasingly dire as more and more young people move there for work opportunities as it's pretty much the only modern city in the country.
flashcarts,"Doesn't the Omega use emulation for the GB? I've tried a couple games and many of them had graphical glitches and one of them didn't even boot. That's a huge downgrade from real hardware, which is the point of using a flashcard in the first place"
NintendoSwitch,"The sequel is much more combat oriented with multiple customisable upgrade options similar to Hollow Knight if that's what you're into. In fact, the game mechanics of WotW take heavy inspiration from HK as a whole.

For me Ori is all about smooth and snappy movement, and both titles are excellent in that regard.

If you definitely don't like Ori, then The Messenger is an extremely strong option available on the Switch. 100% recommended. Axiom Verge has also been ported to the Switch.

And you always have the OG Super Metroid through the NSO service. Been playing it for 25 years and still not tired of it!"

hardware,"Traditional semiconductors are made more like your typical inkjet printer, with every component on the same plane, which made for cheap and easy manufacturing but it's space inefficient. Fin-FET adopts a technique more akin to 3D printing, in that components have a certain verticality to it, allowing for transistors to be placed vertically and thus making them more space efficient so we can cram more stuff in the same die area."
hardware,"I'm surprised there was no mention of the Covington Celerons. They were basically Pentium II chips with no L2 cache at all, making them effectively braindead and incapable of anything close to what its proper Pentium II brother could accomplish. If you thought cache-less SSDs were dumpster fires, you haven't seen a cache-less CPU."

worldnews,"Nobody likes the puppet government the Saudis installed, what a surprise."
speedrun,"Yes, and that's what I mean when I said that some games are translated by different teams in mainland China and Taiwan, for example, resulting in script divergences. But those are not related to the usage of the Chinese script itself, which is consistent across the entire region."
speedrun,"Chinese is generally faster in games that have it available, for the same reasons Japanese is generally faster than languages written in the latin alphabet: it uses fewer characters for the same dialogue.

That's why many if not most newer games are being run in Chinese now that more and more games are translated into that language."
speedrun,"Simplified and Traditional Chinese are effectively the same character set with different variants on some of them. It's like writing English in cursive, linguistically there are no differences whatsoever. CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) characters are all interchangeable, you can in theory even write Japanese with the kanji replaced by their Simplified Chinese counterparts and the meaning would not change at all, and vice-versa.

However, some games that have both versions available might have them done by different teams in charge of translating the game to Chinese, so you could get dialogue and naming differences that can be longer or shorter depending on who did them. Many modern games released over the past few years straight up have the same dialogues with the character set swapped 1:1."

oneplus,"I think the OP5T in particular has that jelly effect when scrolling because the screen refreshes from top to bottom and they mounted the screen upside down compared to the normal placement in most phones. So when scrolling the screen refreshes against the normal scroll behaviour in most phones and you get uneven refresh pacing i.e. jelly.

It's also very evident in bigger devices like OLED tablets when you scroll in landscape mode if the screen refreshes vertically, and vice versa is it's a horizontal refresh display and you scroll it on portrait mode."

3DS,"As you said, it's outdated and suffers from severe hardware limitations. The 3DS simply doesn't have the memory required for modern websites.

Even Nintendo themselves have largely given up on supporting more features and updating the browser beyond what's absolutely necessary to not open security holes in it. In an era where everyone has a better internet device with them at all times, the 3DS browser is pretty much obsolete."
OriAndTheBlindForest,What's different compared to the first time?
ThatLookedExpensive,There's still no reason for retail stores to not have prices shown with tax included unless it's to deliberately hide the costs until check out.
OriAndTheBlindForest,"I'm pretty sure I've sequence broken a couple things during my playthrough (saved points to get Triple Jump as early as possible as that's easily the best skill in both the original and WotW) so I'm no longer sure whether it's intended or a bug whenever something weird happens anymore lmao, especially with how glitchy the game is."
OriAndTheBlindForest,"I'll check it out later, thanks. Is the ""floor"" supposed to be invisible? I also noticed that the rope to the right of where I took the screenshot (where you have to go through a series of lasers) is also invisible, so Ori just appears to grab the air in there."
oneplus,"Curved screen edges though. That's the main reason I decided to go for the 7T, even if they were the same price."
OriAndTheBlindForest,I've been able to warp while airborne even. I think it's only during battles and story interactive cutscenes (like the stealth mission) that the warp function is disabled.
OriAndTheBlindForest,"In the Wellspring, after beating it and clearing the water."
emulation,"Huh weird, now when using the firmware menu to select a BIOS file it doesn't filter any file types, but a moment ago when I tried to load a GBA game without the BIOS it asked me to assign a firmware file and in the dialogue that pops up it asked for a GBA game file, and the only way to have the BIOS file appear in the dialogue was to have it as a ZIP file (as GBA games can be packaged in).

Might be my own fault, sorry if I made you worry for nothing haha."
emulation,"Hey Near, awesome work with byuu! Easily my new favourite multi system emulator on the PC now. However, could you make the process for assigning BIOS and firmware files a bit easier? As things are now it's not that intuitive, because the file selection dialogue doesn't show .bin files like other emulators and instead prefers pulling compressed ZIP files. Having a firmware folder in the root of the emulator package (together with filters etc.) where it copies the relevant assigned firmware files will also help organise this much better."
furry_irl,"We remove rule breaking content only. Sometimes even the shittiest quality content stays up because they don't break the rules. It's up to the userbase to upvote or downvote submissions based on the merit of their content. 

We as mods can only enforce the rules, and while the rules have some provisions against content abuse (repost spam, completely offtopic content, hateful submissions etc.), we can't control the upvotes each submission gets. That's on you and other users to do so. Even if we mods downvote all the stuff we don't like we're still just 10 votes against hundreds."

hardware,"The 1050Ti also exploded in popularity during the crypto mining craze, as they were the only graphics cards left that weren't efficient or useful enough for mining.

hardware,It's still a perfectly capable laptop that can be docked/plugged to a monitor and KBM when not using it in portable mode.
hardware,"This design might look better, but it ignores the underlying hardware. The keyboard is most likely a single block that can't be expanded under the trackpad, which by itself is also a single block that can't be cut around the corners under the panel.

While I'd personally be willing to get rid of the function row keys to make more space for the controller, this device is aimed at power users and IT workers who will appreciate having physical F keys more than 3 more mm of space for the controller part."

NintendoSwitch,"Arena is made on Unity, and the Switch SDK has native support for it. Porting should be trivial, question is whether the Android version is being made to support a portrait view by default and that could prove to be a hurdle for a Switch port."
3DS,"Shantae was released as a GBC game a year after the GBA launched, so not many copies were made. It was also a North American exclusive."

3DS,"There's also snes9x for the 3DS: https://github.com/bubble2k16/snes9x_3ds

It's easier to use and more customisable. Just have the ROMs in the SD cards without needing to convert and inject them one by one. Works just the same or better as it's a mature emulator. Canoe (the official ARM emulator Nintendo uses for the VC and SNES Classic) has shown to have poorer accuracy than the likes of snes9x and bsnes.

snes9x also supports many extension chips that the VC doesn't support, such as CX4 and SDD-1."
3DS,"I got mine when Pokémon Black/White 2 launched and the first thing I thought about it was how bad DS games looked on the 3DS screen.

I also got Ocarina of Time 3D as my ""pack-in game"" with the console so all was good in the end."
NintendoSwitch,"I preordered a Japanese copy for my collection, which will take a while to ship to me. I already own ZX and ZXA in their original catridges and the previous compilation of the original 4 games for the NDS.

MMZ is one of my favourite series of all time and seeing Capcom pay attention to it is a breath of fresh air. I don't particularly like MM and MMX, I'm just a big fan of Inti Creates' style, which MMZ embodies perfectly.

Does this Legacy Collection have the DS compilation's Adventure Mode with the reduced difficulty 4 game gauntlet?"
nintendo,"Alternatively you can play the game with one of the many community patches that are out there that fix everything from bugs to enemy balance to translation errors. Lufia II has one of the most vibrant communities on the SNES.

I personally recommend [Frue Lufia](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4129/). It keeps everything as vanilla as possible while applying all sorts of fixes. It even removes regional censorship."
nintendo,It was garbled because the translation text took more space than the Japanese original (it being one of those old games where 1 latin letter took the same space and memory as 1 kana) and it ended up overwriting the tilemap for the shrine when the game loaded.
3DS,"Seems good. A good tell is the font used for the label on the back, where it says ""NTR-005 PAT PEND"". Knockoff cartridges usually have trouble reproducing this exact font."
3DS,"Native means that it's able to run on bare metal without emulation, just like on a real console, what the hell does that have to do with needing a BIOS? GBARunner2 needs a BIOS file because it's a third party hypervisor and the BIOS is copyrighted.

I'm done talking to you, I recommend you seek help with your anger issues."
3DS,"There's an app called Checkpoint. It makes backups of any save file in the system, even NDS software. You can then move them to another hacked system and restore them there."
3DS,You can play GBA games natively without VC injection through GBARunner2. Please read up on what you're talking about before you embarrass yourself.
3DS,You can alternatively access the save without a cartridge inserted using homebrew tools like PKSM and transfer the Pokémon in it to the software's storage feature and from there transfer them to another Gen 6/7 game such as OR or USUM.
3DS,The console can be taken apart easily to access the buttons. iFixit should have repair guides for your model so feel free give it a try. I would recommend not turning on the console while the fault persists so as to not cause any further liquid damage.
3DS,"There isn't much online functionality on the 3DS that the Switch doesn't already cover better, but everything should still work for the foreseeable future. The console only reached EOL last year, and Nintendo usually doesn't switch off the service for those consoles until way past that. The 3DS still have a very active userbase so don't worry about losing access for the time being."
3DS,It's a really nice console and I love the snappy buttons! They're more similar in feel to old Game Boys than to others in the 3DS family.
3DS,"Depends a lot on what you want to use it for. A New3DS is pretty much required for SNES, PSX and MD/Genesis emulation. So if you only want to use the device to play native GBA, NDS and 3DS games then an old 3DS (preferably XL) is fine.

The New 3DS is my favourite emulation platform for a lot of reasons, starting with ease of use, tight controls, native 240p screen with vertical RGB subpixels that create a natural scanline effect on old games, and tons of homebrew available to manage your software and saves. And as I said, the console runs GBA and NDS games natively off the SD card (with nds bootstrap and GBARunner) which is a unique feature of the platform you won't get anywhere else.

I recommend getting an XL model regardless as GBA and NDS games look tiny in the original small model."
