Ask_Politics,"One set has been certified by the state as the official vote of the electors of the state.  The other one is a group of people getting together and saying ""we want these electors instead"".  That second group has as much power as reddit getting together and picking alternative electors (i.e. none what so ever).  It's a publicity stunt and more virtue signaling to ingratiate themselves with the maga crowd."
Askpolitics,Because today is the day that the states gather their electors for the final vote.  Why would Hillary be different than anyone else in that regard?
Askpolitics,"So it's pretty well understood and agreed upon that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to try to help Donald Trump.  This is on top of an ongoing effort by Russia to create discord in American society.  Specifically the Russians hacked the DNC and released hacked documents via wikileaks both to make Hillary look bad, and timed to change the media topic after the Access Hollywood tape was released.  What's less well understood is how involved Trump personally or Trumps campaign was in working with the Russians, or how much they knew about the Russians attempts to influence the election.

We know a couple of key facts for certain.  The first is that Donald Trump Jr, in an email with Rob Goldstone was given the following information:

>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his \[Emin Agalarov\] father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.  
>  
>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and it's government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin

Trump Jr took a meeting based on this email exchange, so he knowing agreed to work with the Russian government to find dirt about a political opponent of his fathers.  Trump and others in the meeting say nothing came of the actual meeting.

The second major thing we know is that Michael Flynn (who would become Trumps National Security Advisor) was meeting with the Russians, but lied to the FBI about it.  Lying to the FBI shows consciousness of guilt in some action that you think it's bad enough you don't want the FBI to know about it.  Flynn wasn't the only member of Trumps inner circle that had dealings with Russias in the lead up to the election.

That's mostly what we know specifically about the campaigns interactions with the Russian government.  We also know that Trump has pardoned a number of people that might otherwise had provided additional information about whatever occurred.  We can't determine much beyond that though, because whatever else happened isn't known."
Askpolitics,"So either there is a vast conspiracy between the Democratic party, large parts of the Republicans in congress, the Republicans in Georgia and Arizona, judges in 59 federal court cases, the news media, the voting machine companies, and Trumps Attorney General to defraud the American people and steal the election or...

Trump lost and there isn't evidence of large scale fraud.  Most of us find it much easier to believe the latter, especially when you look at what constitutes evidence for the former."
Askpolitics,Then Nancy Pelosi becomes president on Jan 20th when Trumps term ends.
Askpolitics,"Anarcho-communists don't believe in no government, they believe in no coercive government.  They believe they can gather a group of people together that all agree to the same set of rules, and those rules include collective control of the means of production.  This can work with a fairly small amount of people, but the requirement to have universal consent of all rules by all members makes it nearly impossibly to scale above a certain size."
NoStupidQuestions,"In the movies it's mostly because they want to create tension, or move the plot in a certain direction.  It's the same reason frequently a bad guy will take a hostage, and the good guy voluntarily disarms himself at the villains request.  Mostly it's so the villain can get away, or so the good guy can show you how clever he is to overcome the armed villain.

In real life there are reasons why people wouldn't shoot at each other.  Psychologically it could be difficult to fire in such a situation unless one is trained or well practiced in it.  There is a reasonable fear for one's own life, and you pulling the trigger could end up with you yourself getting killed.  In a reality it's actually quite common to for people to miss with a handgun even at relatively close ranges, and even if you do hit someone it's unlikely to be an immediately fatal shot, which allows them to return fire."
Ask_Politics,"It means trump will lose his 51st court case (unless he hurries up and loses some more before that).  Anyone thinking that the SC is going to just disenfranchise a bunch of states worth of votes and disrupt the entire electoral process just need to look to their handling of the Pennsylvania TRO motion.  They dismissed it with a single sentence with no dissents amongst the 9 justices.  The most likely thing to happen here is that the SC doesn't grant the leave, requiring a lower court case needs to occur first, by which time the electors will have voted and the whole things is moot."
Ask_Politics,"What they think (or at least state as their belief) is that opening them up to liability if they moderate content will force them not to moderate, thereby letting conservative voices not worry about political moderation.  The problem is that repealing 230 wouldn't force a decision between opening themselves up to liability and moderating political speech, it would force a decision between opening themselves up to liability and moderating anything at all.  So either they need to let everything go, no removing spam, porn, and violence, or they have to take responsibility for every piece of content on their site.  Given that choice they are simply going to remove tons of content, anything slightly controversial, anything that might be defamatory, and generally do the exact opposite of what people calling for the repeal say they want."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's really hard to overstate exactly how sparse the fossil record is at times, and how much we have to extrapolate from limited information.  For example Nakalipithecus is thought to be one of the most recent common ancestors of Gorilla's and Humans.  Everything we know about it comes from one partial jaw bone and 14 teeth.  We didn't even know it existed until 2005.  If you want to understand how far the rest of the apes evolved just look at the differentiation among the extant apes."
NoStupidQuestions,"Copyright law gives protection for the actual work, not the themes of that work.  You can make a book about a killer clown terrorizing children in a small town, or a school for wizards, and you are just fine.  Past that things can get harder to tell.  There isn't a formula that says you can quote 6 words from a book before it becomes illegal, or you can use 1 and only 1 character's name.  

For example, Led Zeppelin was inspired by the works of JRR Tolkien.  In their song Ramble On there is this line:

>'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor  
I met a girl so fair  
But Gollum and the Evil One  
Crept up and slipped away with her

So not only is the song based on some of the themes of the books, but it explicitly calls out character and location names."
Ask_Politics,"The democrats would love to have that stimulus, but not at the cost of their other priorities (extended unemployment and state bailout).  Republicans are fighting hard to keep the total cost of any more assistance low.  If a general stimulus bill can get passed, it could (but probably won't) include direct stimulus."
NoStupidQuestions,"Socialism, in its most basic form, is an economic theory about owning the means of production.  The term has become much broader over time to include all kinds of social cooperation and welfare.  Communism is a political theory that uses socialism as its economic theory but expands it to cover things outside the economic realm.  Most of the western world uses liberal democracy as its political theory, and a mix capitalism and socialism as its economic theory under the theory that both pure capitalism and pure socialism lead to issues, and they try to take the best of both."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is good reason to believe that extraterrestrial life may be carbon based and use liquid water.  Carbon is relatively abundant in the universe, and the 4 electron's in its outer shell make it well suited to building complex chemical structures.  Water actually has a number of unique properties, most importantly as a universal solvent, that makes it critical to life on earth.  We also know there are a very large number of planets that sit in the Goldilocks region where liquid water would exist.  So we know the basic building blocks that made us exist in a lot of different places, and we know what to look for, so if extraterrestrial life exists we will have the easiest time finding it in those regions."
Ask_Politics,"I'm not asking for an airtight case, I'm asking for a single piece of actual evidence.  Find 1 single vote that is provably fraudulent to start.  If all those 640k are fraudulent, then it should be pretty trivial to find a single example right?  

Even before that, I'd just like to know what the actual claim of fraud is.  This is an article that claims someone said something.  That is all that it is.  Did this even actually occur?  If so when did this occur, and which county or counties were involved?  With that info we could begin to look into what is happening.  Without that it's just conspiracy nonsense."
Ask_Politics,"The first article you sent is only someone repeating what someone else said happened in a court case, with no evidence or explanation, and simply, like you, says ""this is suspicious"".  What I'm asking for is an actual claim of what happened, and some evidence to support that."
NoStupidQuestions,"We don't know Socrates feelings on democracy, because we only hear about them through Plato and echo's Plato's views on the matter.  But if you accept instead ""Socrates views as expressed by Plato"" as part of the question, the short answer is he believed that democracy would lead to mob rule which could be manipulated by a demagogue who would eventually becomes a tyrant."
NoStupidQuestions,"The purpose of an igloo is to make a pocket of trapped air that can be warmed up, either by a fire or simply by body heat.  Air is actually a really poor conductor of heat.  That means heat doesn't transfer through the air very fast.  This is why you can stick your hand in a 350 degree oven for a couple of seconds and barely feel the heat, but if you touch a piece of metal in that oven you will instantly get burned.  The bricks of the igloo are also quite compressed, and they have limited surface area exposed to the air pocket.  So this means the air very slowly heats the bricks, while they are also being cooled by the outside air.  Over time, due to heat and the pressure of the construction of the structure, it will start to shrink and will need to be re-packed to avoid collapse."
Ask_Politics,"50 court cases, all just ""technicalities""?  Why are Trumps lawyers so bad?  Why do they keep making technical mistakes that keep getting all of their super important court cases thrown out of courts all over the US and in front of Republican judges, even some put on the bench by Trump himself?

Burden of proof lies on the person making the claim.  So far you claim is ""I find this unlikely, therefore it must be fraudulent"".  Start by pointing out what you believe actually happened here?  What counties had suspicious surges?  Was it just one country or a number of counties?  What was the nature of the proposed fraud?  Were these just fake ballots unattached to any voter information?  If so are the vote totals for those counties different than the number of known voters for those counties?  Or are you suggesting that votes were cast by people who didn't actually vote?  Do the signatures on the ballot envelops not match the signatures on file?  Can you find a large number of individuals that will go on record saying they are recorded as having voted but say they didn't vote.  Are the votes in these counties wildly out of sync with historical votes and with the votes across the state and country?

If there was widespread voter fraud finding actually fraudulent votes should be easy, and you shouldn't need to rely on ""I feel this is suspicious""."
Askpolitics,"It seems to be under the premise that Warnock would support a full repeal of the TCJA, and that could raise taxes for some poor people.  That's not currently part of Biden's agenda, and even if it were it would require both GA seats to flip, and 100% of the Democrats in the Senate to approve of the change, including a handful if fairly red states."
Askpolitics,"Almost none.  The nicest you will see mainstream news refer to it is as ""a long shot"", but most lawyers think it had approximately 0% chance of even getting heard by the court.  It's unlikely that the court will grant the leave to file (so that Texas can go straight to the supreme court), we are already at the safe harbor day, and less than a week until the electors vote.  This will end up in the same place as the PA lawsuit."
Ask_Politics,"If the evidence for fraud is so obvious, why do judges keep rejecting it?  We are now up to 50 court cases where Trump or his allies have tried to get ballots rejected and lost?  Not just lost, but lost badly, with the suits simply being dismissed as nonsense because they can't find any actual instances of fraud."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is no universal ""Year 1"".  Usually, for any calendar system they choose year 1 to be the first year after some specific event.  The BC/AD system used by the Gregorian calendar chooses the approximate date of the birth of Jesus as that founding date.   The Chinese calendar starts with the reign of the first Emperor of China.  The Hebrew calendar uses the proposed date of the creation of the world.  The Hindu calendar starts with the reign of Emperor Vikramaditya.

So if we didn't use AD it would simply be another positive number based on whenever we did decide was the first year of our calendar system."
NoStupidQuestions,"Evaluating with the DSM always has a decent amount of subjectivity to it.  If you were to actually look through a copy of it you will see that it lists a number of different symptoms but it's usually more about the frequency and impact of the symptoms than simply the presence or absence.  For example getting anxious from time to time does not mean you have an anxiety disorder.  Getting anxious frequently to a degree that it starts to negatively impact your ability to function may mean you do though.  Generally you should probably work with your therapist over a number of sessions to make yourself feel more comfortable with their initial diagnosis, and to work on coping strategies."
NoStupidQuestions,"While there are some tests questions you can ask, especially for children, there isn't an easy verifiable test for autism, and it gets harder to diagnose as the individual gets older.  Autism is also a spectrum disorder, so it manifests in different ways and to different degrees based on the individual.  Most likely you exhibit some of the classic behavioral signs of autism and/or your descriptions of your thought process is consistent with autism."
Askpolitics,"This lawsuit isn't going anywhere.  Today is already the safe harbor date for lawsuits, so it's too late to be filing new lawsuits, and Texas going directly to the SC over this is mostly a stunt.  The fact that the Texas Solicitor General, who would be the one actually representing the state in such a lawsuit, isn't involved in this lawsuit makes that apparent."
Ask_Politics,"Quite frequently it's a trial ballon, that's the term for intentionally leaking information to see the reaction to the news.  By leaking the information and not stating it outright it gives them plausible deniability to walk back their potential decisions.  But to make a high level decisions like this you need to have so many people involved that it's very difficult to prevent information from leaking out anyway, so it's always hard to tell."
NoStupidQuestions,"Best I can come up with is that the jewish mirror indicates something about jewish control, either of the media, or the world in general.  Him only seeing his clothes and not himself might be that he can't see himself through their lens, or the real him is hidden by jewish control or something like that.  Him breaking the mirror is obviously some sort of call to violence against jews or jewish control.  Him seeing the reflection in the blood is either something about literally the blood being the real version of him (bloodlines and such are a big deal to nazi's), or maybe it's less literal and it's saying that through the struggle the true version of himself is revealed.  In any case he seems quite pleased with himself, and it's important that blood is shed."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is almost no actual information about satan/the devil in the bible.  So most of the elements of that character are from extrabiblical sources and folk tales, and a lot of the modern lay person's understanding comes from pop culture more than anything else.  As such, there isn't a scriptural basis for answering your questions.  Their may or may not be a theological answer to your question though."
NoStupidQuestions,"if you have a variable called taxable\_income that stores the current income you could set up a series of if/elif/else (or a case statement if you've learned those).  You start by determining what is the maximum bracket the person will be in, and then calculate their tax from there.  So:

`if taxable_income <= 48535:`

  `tax = taxable_income * 0.15`

`elif taxable_income > 48535 and taxable_income <= 97069:`

  `tax = ((taxable_income - 48535) * 0.205) + 7280.25`

`...`

What that 4th line is doing is calculating the amount of income above the prior brackets max (48535) and figuring out how much tax is paid in the new bracket, and then just adds the recalculated rate that all tax prior to that would be.  So 7280.25 is how much tax someone with exactly 48535 in income would pay, and then you add the additional income for every dollar above that rate at a 20.5% tax."

Then it had the huge E3 session where they revealed that Keanu Reeves was playing a major character in the series, and that just put the pedal down on the hype train at that point.  It's getting released on Thursday, so right now all the press events and early reviews are landing."

Ask_Politics,"In 1968 LBJ pushed The Gun Control Act of 1968, part of a long effort to increase gun control in response to the assassination of JFK.  The assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and RFK started a shift in peoples opinions about gun control.  There was also a counter-movement amongst gun rights advocates upset with the legislature.  The NRA, which used to be non-partisan started to shift towards becoming primarily a political organization, and they found republicans to be more open to aligning with them.  The defining moment for the NRA came in the 1977 convention, where a revolt amongst the membership away from the traditional sportsmen hunters and towards heavy 2nd amendment support lead to new leadership and new ideals."
NoStupidQuestions,"Similar situation.  Yes it's common for autistics to have specific focus' that they get very invested in, possibly to the point of anger, but it's not something that would instantly identify someone as autistic."
Askpolitics,"Maybe, maybe not.  Usually you wouldn't bring a vote up for consideration unless you are already pretty confident that you have enough votes to pass, but if it fails slightly, you can negotiate with people on the fence to make changes.  For example, maybe Amash would agree to vote for consideration (and for final passage) if you simply give his amendment an up or down vote, and if the consideration vote just barely fails then he might get his wish."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's possible that such behavior is somewhat more likely in autistic individuals, but it's not a clear indicator of autism.  Autism is a spectrum disorder, so both the symptoms and the severity of those symptoms are highly variable from individual to individual.  But one of the most core symptoms of autism is what's called a weak theory of mind.  Theory of mind is the ability for humans to be able to separate out the way they think through a problem from the way other people think through a problem, and see how other people might get to a different answer than they do.  A second common trait among many autistics is the tendency to become hyperfocused on certain hobbies or jobs.  

The combination of these things leads to the somewhat stereotypical situation where an a topic comes up (sometimes only in passing, or tangentially related to the main topic) in a discussion, and the autistic individually suddenly becomes a very animated and active participant in the conversation, and will continue talking on the subject long after other people have lost interest in that subject matter.  They also might hold very strong opinions on the ""correct"" elements of their hobby.  Because it is exceedingly difficult for them to understand other peoples point of view it can lead to agitation at the disagreement, and over time this agitation can turn to anger.  I wouldn't say simply seeing someone argue passionately about a hobby is sign of autism though."
Askpolitics,"Voting on consideration is a procedural vote that sets the rules for how the debate and vote will go.  For this particular vote there was no allotment for additional amendments and the debate was limited to 1 hour.  Most of the votes on consideration were simply votes to move the bill forward (or against moving it forward) for final vote, but Amash might have wanted a specific change for amendment but will accept the bill as written since it's the one available to vote on."
Ask_Politics,"grudzy answered correctly, the names of those that voted in an election are public information, but there isn't a way to connect the names to the individual votes."
Ask_Politics,"There have been lots of talk about ""suspicious"" vote spikes since the night of the election.  There were definitely some spikes of vote counts getting officially announced, but this is pretty typical.  Further, because of very large partisan differences in vote by mail versus vote in person 2020 depending on where and what type of votes are getting counted you will get very biased results in any given block of votes counted.  In the rust belt they counted in person voting first, giving Trump a significant lead, but then when they got to the dense cities, and especially mail in voting in those cities, you see the biden voters showing up.  The opposite happened in Arizona, which went from very favorable to Biden to being very close by the end.  Again, there isn't anything unexpected about this, it's just people saying ""I can't imagine that some types of votes would be so heavily Biden voters"".

Also, who votes in US elections is a matter of public record.  If people think that a bunch of fake ballots were counted they can easily found out the names of the people that voted and check with a sample of them whether they actually voted or not.  If there was rampant voter fraud like what is being alleged they should be able to find 1000's of people that show up as voting who will swear they didn't vote in this election, but they don't find those people.  They just loudly scream ""this is suspicious to me so it must be fraudulent"""
Askpolitics,"From Volume 2 of the Senate Report on Russian Interference, pg 42.

>After the election, IRA operatives orchestrated disparate  
political rallies in the United States both supporting president-elect Trump, and protesting the results of the election. A mid-November 2016 rally in New York was organized around the theme, ""show your support for President Elect Donald Trump,"" while a separate rally titled, ""Trump is NOT my President,"" was also held in New York, in roughly the same timeframe."
NoStupidQuestions,"What makes something funny is actually pretty complex, but one of the most consistent element of a joke is that it subverts expectations.  You start to tell a story, the listener naturally assumes it's going one direction, instead it goes a different direction and that's were the humor comes in.  Generally a punchline that diverges most significantly from expectations, while still being logically connected to the setup, are considered the most humorous.  Taboo subjects, by their nature, tend not to be something we talk about, and therefore aren't expected.  Additionally taboo subjects tend to cause a sense of thrill when discussed, adding to the effect."
NoStupidQuestions,"The bodies fight or flight system mostly takes care of this.  Adrenaline tends to shut down parts of the body that aren't immediately necessary for survival, which includes digesting and excretion.  The reason you feel butterflies in your stomach when you get nervous is because that's the sensation of your stomach shutting down blood being shifted away towards your major muscle groups."

Ask_Politics,"Besides finding a way to turn a huge number of Biden electors (which isn't going to happen) to Trump his term ends on January 20th.  Any of the crazy schemes to prevent the election results from being accepted don't magically make Trump president again, they all end with no presidential winner, which means Nancy Pelosi becomes interim president. 

Absent a constitutional amendment there is no legal way for Trump to serve more than 1 more term."
Askpolitics,"Not legally.  Martial law is quite restricted in the US for obvious reasons, there is no legal way to stop the vote and have the military force a revote."
Ask_Politics,"Partly it's just performance theater.  No reasonable person would actually remove section 230, because it would be disastrous.  They could look to alter 230 in some way, but there is no real way to get what the conservatives really want out of this (a lack of moderation on conservative thought).  So instead it's mostly a threat that Trump can do disastrous things to big tech if they don't play ball with him, which is no longer really a threat given he's a lame duck."
Askpolitics,"Yes, Yellen is pretty well respected, isn't considered partisan, and has a great resume for the role.  The republicans should actually be quite happy with that choice.  It's also part of the carrot and stick that Biden will need to use with the Senate, since he doesn't have control.  If Republicans generally agree to support Biden's candidates, but let them veto one or two of them, then they can start with at least a functioning government, or we can go right back to full partisan warfare again."
Askpolitics,"A large part of US law is derived from from English common law, and presidential pardon's are modeled off the pardon powers of the english monarchy, and those powers go back a very long time.  In the earliest days it was simply seen as an act of mercy by the monarch, sometimes accompanied by an act of contrition by the criminal.  As court's became more formalized it became a check against judicial over reach.  In the most modern version it's mostly about deciding that the law is working in unintended ways, or simply that the general feelings about how the law should work have changed, and the current punishment is now considered unjust.  So it provides one last final check that people are not being punished against the will of the people."
Askpolitics,"Realistically the Republicans can fight one or two of them and possibly win, or at least score some points by fighting them.  If the Republicans tried to blanket stop all of Biden's nominees then he just puts whoever he wants as an acting secretary in their place.  One cheeky example  is that he puts Hillary Clinton in any role the republicans don't like his current choice and see if they think maybe the current choice isn't that bad.  

So if they really wanted to stop Tanden specifically they may be able to make enough of a fuss about her twitter history that Biden decides it's not worth the fight and he choses someone else, but that's probably the extent of it.  We know, for example, that Yellen is already getting republican support for Secretary of the Treasury."
Askpolitics,"You cannot pardon a future criminal act, and you can give blanket pardons for all federal offenses."
Askpolitics,"The pardon power of the president is exceedingly broad and without any real counter.  The only real limits are that the president can only pardon federal offenses, not state level offenses, and you can't pardon future criminal activity.  You do not need to admit guilt because you could pardon even theoretical uncharged offenses.

So for example when Nixon was pardoned that pardon was for any and all crimes committed during his presidency.   Carter also gave a blanket pardon to all draft dodgers from the vietnam war era without even naming them individually."
Ask_Politics,"The role of Senate majority leader is intentionally given a  large amount of power.  The Senate  has fewer members than the house, making each senator more powerful than a member of the house.  They are elected for 6 years, so longer than the president, and they are built to be a deliberating body that is slow to act, and works on longer term issues.  All of that is working as intended.

But the actual person in the role only has that much power with the support of the majority of the senate though.  The power is derived by that support.  If republicans didn't agree with what Mitch McConnell was doing then he wouldn't be doing it.  Every 2 years there are new elections that can force the majority into the minority, and even if McConnell held on to the majority, he could be forced out if he didn't have the support of the party.  On top of that if there was a rebellion within the republican party they could side with the democrats to effectively take control of the Senate."
Ask_Politics,"For similar reasons that Nancy Pelosi gets so much hate.  The congressional leadership for each party lasts much longer than a president does on average.  They end up being a focus for the opposing party, representing everything that is disliked about that party.  Additionally they tend to not be well liked by voters in their own party, as they are scapegoated for every failure of the party during their leadership.  Even independents tend to dislike them, because they are seen as symbols of partisanship and gridlock in congress."
Ask_Politics,"You need to look at the raw vote totals in these counties.  Take Starr county as an example, where the percentages shifted by 55%.  The total vote count was Biden 9,123, Trump 8,247.  Compare to 2016 when the vote was Clinton 9,289, Trump 2,224.  So it's not so much that Trump shifted a bunch of latino voters, it's that he drove new voters.  These counties suffer from very low turnout most elections, so something did spark a bunch of voters to turn out this year.  The total quantity of these voters is small though, so it's unlikely to change much of the situation in Texas as a whole."
Askpolitics,"I'm not familiar with this particular conspiracy theory (do you have a direct source for this information?) but the problem with almost all of these is that who votes in a given election is a matter of public record.  If one really wanted to they could find the names of all of these U voters and actually see if they existed or not.  The governor of Arizona has a long [thread](https://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1333603735855976450) on how strict Arizona's voter security is.  So we aren't talking about not just creating fake ballots, you'd need fake persona's, with unique signatures, with driver's licenses, and addresses.  You'd also need actual humans to go vote in person, with the proper documentation.

You'd need this conspiracy to go on for decades without being detected.  You also need, for some reason, for the conspirators to all list themselves as U (even though they would need an ID with a picture to vote), which would draw attention to themselves.  Including many years where the republicans won (such as Trump 2016).  Why have a decades long conspiracy that doesn't actually work most year, just to save it for 2020?  You'd also need the cooperation of republican governor (who just certified the results).  It, like every other conspiracy kicked out of court, appears to be without merit."
Askpolitics,"We've known since about 3 days after the election that Biden has won.  Predictably the recounts didn't change the vote totals by much, and the long shot legal attempts were shot down.  Now the votes have been certified, there is nothing else to wait for but the electoral college vote, but there is no reason to suspect it will be anything other than a Biden victory.  There is no reasonable way for Trump to win this election at this point, so it's completely unexceptionable that Biden continue with his transition planning like every other president would do at this point."
Askpolitics,"Once the election has been called the president-elect starts working on his transition team.  That's what happened in 2016 with Trump (who was called president-elect the day after the election).  You don't want to wait until the electors sit before you start on your plan, you actually need the time to prepare for becoming president and vetting your cabinet members."
Ask_Politics,"There have been a number of suggested ways to conduct a ""soft coup"".  Such as replacing the electors sent by a state, or refusing to allow electors to vote, but none of those things ever make Trump president.  All they could possibly do is not let president elect Biden become president in time for the inauguration, and since Trump isn't president on Jan 21, and Pence isn't VP, the 3rd in line of succession (Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi) becomes interim president.  At which point they'd have to clean up the big mess and you eventually get Biden in charge again."
Ask_Politics,President Trump is no longer president after January 20th.  Anything you do to try to defeat that process ends up with interim president Nancy Pelosi.
Askpolitics,"It's going to be pretty impossible to disprove ""this used to be here but now it's gone"" from a single image like that.  I will say if you go to the PA Department of State website and look at news ([https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/State.aspx](https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/State.aspx)) the formatting looks nothing like the above.  Further, for this to be actual evidence of fraud you have to believe both that the fraudsters are incredible stupid to basically admit to cheating on their own webpage, and yet smart enough to have the ability to create and hide 1 million fake mail in voters in a way that is completely untraceable if they don't brag about it."
Askpolitics,"There is no real way to ""soft coup"" this election.  Trumps term ends on Jan 20th, anything that would prevent Biden from being seated on inauguration day leads to interim president Pelosi."
Askpolitics,"Probably.  If he wants to run as a Republican the normal process would be for him to run in the primary like anyone else.  This is also true of sitting presidents, even though some states this year did not conduct a primary and instead defaulted to Trump.  But, the primary process is mostly determined by the parties (although they have to follow state laws to show up on the primary ballots), so they could instead just skip the primary and have the party heads determine the presidential candidate.  This seems unlikely though, especially because Trump just lost an election.  Trump could also run as an independent, and then he just needs to get himself on the ballot in enough states to show up on the presidential ballots."
Askpolitics,"I've seen legal assessments on both sides of the argument, so I wouldn't say comfortably that it is or is not constitutional, absent a supreme court case.  The safer thing would definitely be to have Pence do the pardon, but Trump may not trust Pence enough for that, or he's afraid of the optics involved (although he usually doesn't care about optics)."
Askpolitics,"Nothing around Biden is any different than any other election year.  Trump was called president-elect Trump the day after the election in 2016, after the media called the race, before the race was certified, and well before the electoral college vote.  He also started building his transition team immediately after the election, as all presidential candidates tend to do.  So yes, Biden is president-elect to the same degree that Trump was at this point in 2016."
Askpolitics,"Maybe.

Presidential pardon power is very broad, and the only real limit is that they can only affect federal charges, not state charges.  For example Ford's pardon of Nixon includes the text:

>Now, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974.

Whether a president can pardon themselves is an untested legal theory, but it's one that could be found valid, so there is a legitimate chance Trump could pardon himself and that it works for federal offenses.  Unfortunately for Trump he looks to be facing potential NY State charges, which he can not pardon himself from."
Ask_Politics,"There are two separate issues here.  One is that the EC doesn't just give smaller states increased representation, and it needs to be judged on it's actually implementation, not just the goal it's attempting to achieve.  The second is, do we really want to give increased voting power of people in small states for the presidency.  

The Electoral College itself is a leftover from a time before instant communication over vast distances, as well as not trusting every American to be able to make decisions on things like their elected officials.  So actually going through the mechanism to vote for actual human electors who votes are then semi-bound isn't not just wasteful, it leads to things like faithless electors who could sway an election away from results chosen by the states.  Our current implementation where states are mostly winner take all is problematic as well.  That means that many people feel their vote doesn't count, because the margin of victory doesn't matter and the winner is well known ahead of time.  This also means that the candidates know they can mostly ignore these states (including almost all of the small states that in theory have more voting power).  This is obviously not a good situation for a democracy.  What the candidates do care about, though, is specific issues that are highly important os particular swing states.  That means the candidates will focus on things like fracking for Pennsylvania, or the auto industry for Michigan, while they ignore things like water usage for California farmers.

You could keep the exact same level of additional voting power for small states without an actual electoral college.  There is no reason (other than tradition and the current laws) why we need to vote for individual electors, and they could be replaced with automatically bound virtual electors for each state.  You could also allot the electors proportional to the vote in each state, either as full virtual electors, or just turn the entire EC into an algorithm and a lot EC votes fractionally.

Now on to the ""do small states need additional voting rights"" part.  If you were just making an electoral system from scratch it's seems likely to start with a national popular vote as a baseline.  But then maybe you think ""what about the tyranny of the majority""?  Are there minority groups that need some special protection under the law? And if so, which groups need this protection and what form should it take?  Maybe you think racial minorities need protection, or maybe groups with specific relationships to the US like descendants of slaves, native Americans, or people in American territories.  But your first thought on who needs this special protection probably isn't Montanans.  We already give huge over representation to small states via the Senate.  It's also based on a system of decentralized power and anti-federalism that hasn't existed in the US for the last 100 years.  There is no particularly good reason to keep the EC in it's current form just to keep additional voting rights to small states."
Ask_Politics,"States decide their own election laws.  And the recount laws in each state are what govern how we do recounts.  People that unfounded claim there is mass election fraud aren’t suddenly going to change their mind after a recount finds the same results before, and we shouldn’t be asking states to ignore their own laws just because people are angry at the results."
Ask_Politics,"It would be slightly red swing state.  If the voting patterns didn't change at all, then Biden would have would taken Greater Virginia by 2.8% in 2020, and Trump would have won it by 2% in 2016.  If we presume the final national vote ends up somewhere around 4% advantage for Biden, then the Greater Virginia would have been 1.2 points redder than the nation in 2020, and 4.1 points redder in 2016."
Askpolitics,"If the majority didn't like what Mitch was doing the majority wouldn't pick Mitch for their leader.  They could simply remove him from power and put someone else in his place.  There are also ways to force a vote on an issue without the majority leaders personal approval.  So it's not one man that's blocking bills from passing the Senate, it's the majority party.

Now the House is always going to pass more bills than the Senate.  The House was meant for that, it's supposed to be fast and responsive, the senate is suppose to be slow and deliberate, finding agreement between those two groups is supposed to make for better legislature.  So if Democrats in the House want to actually pass legislature, they need to negotiate with the Senate until both sides can agree.  If one side is just being stubborn, and refusing to negotiate at all, then you need to make that an electoral issue and convince the voters that the other side is being obstructionist."
Askpolitics,"This thread from r/conservative explains it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jo38f6/in\_reference\_to\_those\_133889\_votes\_that\_came\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jo38f6/in_reference_to_those_133889_votes_that_came_in/)

Short version, there was an error in the way the media reported a vote total, not the official vote count.  They then fixed the error.  Someone took screenshots, inverted their order, and claimed it was the official count who's numbers magically shot up."
Askpolitics,"It wouldn't matter.  The Senate Majority leader (almost certainly Mitch McConnell) sets the agenda for the Senate, which means he doesn't need to bring any piece of legislature forward that he doesn't agree with."
Askpolitics,"Because it's generally bad for the state's electoral power.  If a state like Ohio had its 18 votes, but broke them up by congressional district, then the state would tend to split their vote, and it wouldn't be worth it for presidential candidates to campaign there.  It would also open up the presidential vote open to gerrymandering if done by congressional district like Maine and Nebraska."
Askpolitics,"That depends on the State.  It looks like mail in ballots need to be received by Friday to be counted in Pennsylvania, but the actual counting can occur later than that."
Askpolitics,"Calls are something the media does, and it's just them making a prediction as to who is going to win the state.  Since it's really embarrassing if they make the wrong call, they try to be nearly certain before they call a state.  But states like California, where there is almost no chance of an upset, they don't need very much evidence to be convinced of who will win.  So when polling tells you it's not going to be close, and exit polling tells you it's not going to be close, and the first votes coming in are consistent with it not being close, then the state will get called with even 1% of the vote counted.

Right now California is still only 74% done with their count, and it often takes a week or more to finish the California count, but no one minds because everyone already knows which way California is going."
Askpolitics,"Some organizations (like NY Times) have the count at 253, others (AP, Fox) have it at 264.  The difference is those that have called Arizona (11 EC) for Biden and those that don't.  It's probably smarter to not have AZ called at this point.  Biden is the likely victor, but it isn't quite certain enough to call the state, and it was really early to call AZ when Fox did last night."
Askpolitics,They keep counting until all the votes are counted.  The only thing that might prevent that is that the timing around the meeting of the Electoral College (in December).
Askpolitics,"Yes, but anything done by a presidential order can simply be undone by a presidential order.  They aren't new legislation, they are just directives from the president to the executive branch to act in a certain way that was already allowable for them to do via constitutional power or Congressional legislation."
Askpolitics,"You probably shouldn't trust anyone who claims to have a perfect record.  It's not very hard to predict the winner of the presidential election.  Flipping a coin gives you a 50/50 chance of predicting the right outcome, and there are lots of people making predictions, so the odds that one of them got 10 correct in a row by blind chance is actually pretty high.  But most elections aren't even that close, so if you just went with a system where you pick someone if they are winning by more than 5% in the national polls, and you flip a coin on the close races, your odds of arbitrary selecting the right winner 10 times in a row would be quite good.

So there are quite a few people that have some sort of ""model"" or set of guidelines for predicting the presidential winner.  Frequently the rules are pretty subjective, letting them fiddle with the rules to fit whatever winner they actually think will work.  Then they give themselves a pass on 2016 and 2000 because the popular vote winner and the EC winner were different.  This allows them to declare victory regardless of who their prediction said would win, and those just happen to be the two closest (and therefore hardest) elections in the last 40 years.

The second variety you will find is people making a model recently, then retroactively running their model against prior elections and declaring they would have properly predicted the last X elections in a row.  It's actual pretty trivial to tweak a set of rules to fit what actually happened.  This is called overfitting in statistics, and the results of overfit models is they have weak predictive power.

It's better simply to embrace the unpredictability of an election, and properly treat this as a probabilistic event.  All current data suggests Biden has a moderate to large lead right now, we've had tons of early voting, and we are down to the last day before the election.  So basically it's a football game with 6 minutes left, and Trump is down by 10.  He needs to to march down the field, get a touchdown, the 2 point conversion, and then still get an onside kick and hit the field goal to win.  That's not impossible, in fact it's happened plenty of times in real life, it's not jut very likely."
Ask_Politics,"Not really.  Congress cannot write a law that binds future congresses to follow that law.  Any law they could create they could just rewrite.  So yes, we have systems like PAYGO, but it has been changed or dropped, and when things really matter they just except a particular piece of legislature from PAYGO to pass it.  So laws like PAYGO are really just guidelines.  They set a goal, but still allow you to work around them."
Ask_Politics,"You aren't going to be able to get an answer to that any time soon, as there isn't some real time information on voter fraud.  One of the most common types of voter fraud is double voting, usually by voting early, then trying to vote again on election day, and that couldn't have even happened yet.  Additionally, rates of verified voter fraud are so low (1,298 times since 1992 according to the Heritage Foundation) that you could only really compare rates if one of the to years had a giant increase in voter fraud."
Askpolitics,"Exit polling traditional doesn't get released until polls have closed in that state.  What you can see is the partisan makeup of the voters that have voted.  That not a great indicator of the final vote, and it's early voting which is often very skewed.  What it does do is get an indicator of total turnout (very high this year, even accounting for expanded early voting mechanisms)."
Askpolitics,"MT-Sen.  The seat is currently held by Steve Daines, who is running for his first reelection. Daines approval rating is a solid 47-31 (+16), and Montana is a R+11 state, so this seat was considered safe.  That was, until Steve Bullock entered the race.  Steve Bullock is the current Democratic governor of Montana.  First elected in 2012 he's about to finish his second term as governor, so he's obviously the kind of Democrat that can win in Montana.  Montana is also a small state that can be won over with retail politics and so is a winnable state for Democrats.  That's how Jon Tester won his Senate seat in 2006 and has held it ever since.  Polling has been light, but close, with most polls showing a slight lead for Daines, but occasionally big leads (Emerson +9 10/7).  538 puts the odds at as 65/35 in favor of Daines.  So Dems are underdogs but this is one of the more realistic upsets we could see happen."
Askpolitics,"Newspapers have traditionally had an editorial section, separate from the main news articles, where they allow people to write opinion pieces.  These opinions are still limited to what the editors of the newspaper believe to be good faith opinions, and frequently they seek out dissenting voices to give a range of opinions on an issue, and are frequently from individuals not directly working for the news agency.  It's the editorial board that does newspaper endorsements, and they are expected to be the opinions of the board itself, and treated similar to other OpEd style articles.  This separation of opinion piece from fact-based pieces is meant to install confidence that the fact-based pieces are free from editorial bias.  That's obviously not going to be 100% true, but it's an attempt to do things that way.  Television news isn't nearly as clear about separating the two, leading to a lot of crossing of the streams."
Ask_Politics,"There are different ballots for different voting places.  This is required because the ballot will have local races, county level positions and county ballot initiatives, as well as your house district election.  So that means even two people in the same city won't always be getting the same style ballot.  It would complicate things quite a bit to allow people to vote anywhere in the state by just showing up to the voting area, and then trying to figure out which of the potentially hundreds of different ballots for the state each person needs, without accidentally giving them the wrong one and having them invalidate large parts of their vote."
Askpolitics,"The Supreme Court can't just decide that Obamacare is now illegal.  They need to look at the case before them and decide if the legal theory being purported is valid.  The case that's before them is centered around whether the fact that republicans have dropped the cost of the individual mandate to $0 means that it can no longer be considered a tax, which means it is no longer covered by Congresses power to tax, which makes it unconstitutional.  Further you then would need to determine that there is no way to sever the individual mandate from the ACA, and that the entirety of the ACA had to be thrown out as the only way to resolve this.  That's...quite a stretch.  Further, allowing such a thing would open up a giant can of worms with all kinds of major pieces of legislature being attacked on similar grounds.

Even if the current court doesn't like the way Sebelius was decided, that doesn't mean they want to go creating more problems just to backdoor repeal the ACA.  Jonathan Adler, who has worked for years to repeal parts of the ACA via the courts, filed an amicus brief against the current case: 'Submitting a friend of court brief for himself and three others, Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said, ""The four of us do not agree on much, particularly where the Affordable Care Act is concerned, but we all agree that the decision below is unmoored from law or contemporary doctrine.""'"
Ask_Politics,"Obama had a filibuster proof Senate for only 6 months though, so even before the 2010 midterms he was in a position to block Obama's legislative and judicial agenda."
Ask_Politics,"Ross Perot came pretty close in 1992.  Perot was a billionaire that ran a self funded campaign as an independent.  George Bush Sr. had been a popular president, but a recession late in his term had hurt him significant.  Perot ran on mostly economic issues, which resonated well at the time.  He turned the race into a true 3 party race, and was even winning in some polls.  But his campaign team started to fall apart because he refused to listen to their advice, eventually leading to his campaign manager quitting.  His numbers started to drop, then he abruptly suspended his campaign.  The two weeks later he reentered the race and explained that he only suspended his campaign because the Republicans were trying to ruin his daughters wedding.  This, mixed with internal stories that Perot accused people in his campaign of being CIA spies, lead to concerns that he might be legitimately mentally unwell.  In the end he got 0 electoral votes, but 18.9% of the popular vote, which is still the best of any 3rd party in modern history."
Askpolitics,"At the beginning of each session (every 2 years, in January after the elections) there are leadership elections in both houses of Congress.  These are usually not particularly interesting though.  Prior to that whoever won the majority will have voted just with their caucus to choose who they want as a leader, and the actual election is just a party line vote.  Almost always the leader isn't a surprise, it's usually the current leader, or if that leader has stepped down, their top lieutenant.  So no, it's not automatic, but it is 100% expected."
Ask_Politics,"Republicans have been much more focused on the courts than democrats.  During the Obama era McConnell did everything he possibly could to delay and deny Obama judges, leading to a massive hole to fill.  Once Trump took office the flood gates opened and they filled in all the judges that didn't get filled during the Obama era, and fast tracked the process to make sure there weren't any vacancies in case they lost the next election."
Askpolitics,"Something akin to an actual civil war is exceedingly unlikely.  While people are very heated right now, and the rhetoric is off the charts, this isn't anything really like the civil war.  In that case you had a large group of states who's entire economy and way of life was dependent on slavery, and another large group of states that found that practice so abhorrent they couldn't stand to allow it any longer.  It was also something growing for the nearly 100 years at that point, and at a time with a much less federal governmental control.  So an actually revolution with military on both sides kind of civil war just isn't in the cards right now.

There may be political violence though.  But that's not out of the ordinary really.  There is political violence today.  We've seen antigovernment militias, assassinations of abortion doctors, and lone wolves attacking the olympics and trying to poison political figures with anthrax.  Before that you had Vietnam war protesters and counter-protestors, militant police forces versus leftists.  That's still going to happen, and maybe it will get worse after the election than before, but that's not a preamble to civil war."
Askpolitics,"Very Likely: Jones (AL), McSally (AZ), Gardner (CO)

Askpolitics,"There is only so much a president can do in such a case.  So you can argue over things like who's fault is is that we didn't have enough PPE stockpiled, or what more the president could have done to help states relieve that resource crunch.  But those things are mostly in the details, and not the kind of thing that changes peoples minds.

The thing we actually expect from our president in such times, though, is to lead.  The president should be gather the best specialists in the world, figuring out the proper response to the virus, getting all the states on board with as unified a response as possible, getting the word out and leading by example by encouraging social distancing and mask usage.  They should also trying vey hard to inform people of the actual danger of the virus, without creating fear and panic.  That can be difficult, but presidents are often in situation to provide just that kind of ""the task is hard, but we are prepared"" reassurance.

What Trump did was basically the opposite.  He underplayed the virus at every possible turn, trying to convince people it wasn't that bad, that it wasn't going to grow, that it was already gone.  He politicized common sense response to the virus, making lack of mask wearing and social distancing into tenets of faith, and personally not following these guidelines.  He made all the politicians around him, likewise ignore common sense protections, putting the entire continuity of government at unnecessary risk.  He mocked those that wore masks, while he encouraged protests against lockdowns.  He held super spreading events that killed his own advocates.  He treated this as just a blue state problem, while it ravaged red states that never full locked down.  He has promoted untested medicines as cure alls, overpromised on vaccine timelines and availability.  Basically every personal action Trump has taken with regard to covid has been worst than useless, it's been deadly.  His only real defense is to keep saying that covid isn't really that bad, and we just have to wait accept the levels of sick and dying that we have today, because no one else could have done better."
ufc,"The Ferguson/Gaethje fight really threw me.  I was expecting Tony to have a pretty easy time, but not only did he look really bad, but Gaethje looked better than he has in the past, possibly his best fight in the UFC.  I also disagree with your assessment that Gaethje had the weakest showing against Khabib.  Poirier was the closest to a fight ending sequence with his submission attempt, but he didn't win a single round of his fight.  Conor took a round off of Khabib, but had no real counter to the repeated take downs and dagastani handcuffs.  Justin was actually winning the fight at the end of the first, and looked to have a game plan that could let him win the fight, but then in a heartbeat he goes from landing a good leg strike, to begin taken down and in mount, to unconscious.  All of them got submitted in the end, but I thought Gaetje fought him the most evenly of the three.

 It's hard to see where Conor is at this point.  The Cowboy fight was barely a fight, so hard to judge where Conor is from that.  He obviously lost to Khabib, but everyone lost to Khabib, so not sure what that proves either.   So at this point I think the top 4 rankings are pretty close to correct.  Conor is the biggest question mark, and could be higher or lower, but his fight with Poirier should give us a pretty good indicator of where he's at.  And if Poirier beats McGregor his next fight should be for the open belt if he doesn't have it already."
Ask_Politics,"Florida will be a good indicator.  They are used to large amounts of mail in voters and are set up to count them fast, so we should get results out of Florida relatively early.  Unfortunately Florida is set to be pretty close so that may not help us very much.  If Biden is winning Florida by a significant margin things are probably over for Trump, but if the vote is still close we could be looking at anything from narrow Trump victory, to moderate Biden victory.  

After that I would look to Michigan.  Pennsylvania is the big swing state, but with unpredictable mail in voting returns, and potentially a tight race, it might be very late before we get a clear picture of what's happening there.  Michigan, though, is not currently looking to be a close race.  A clear win by Biden here, in line with current polling, would indicate we are unlikely to see a large rust belt poll miss like 2016.  That's the one big thing Trump is absolutely counting on for a win, and if we don't see indications in Michigan, it's unlikely that Trump can win."
Askpolitics,"Most years (but not this year) you can watch the returns coming from the major swing states like Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.  Luckily those states finish their vote pretty early in the evening, and so at 8:00 PM EST you will start to see the early big indicators of where the the election will end up.  So you can watch each counties reporting and figuring out who's winner, even before the full results are done.  If the election isn't close, you can pretty quickly tell and even though the media may not call the election that early, in reality it's mostly over.  If the election is close as those states start reporting then the election is likely close and you'll need to wait much longer.

Now if 2020 were a normal year, and you had one candidate polling with a 9% lead pretty continuously, you'd actually expect this to be a pretty easy and quick call.  But because of covid early and mail in voting this year is going to be very different than prior years, and because of current partisanship about mail in voting we really can' tell very well what the mail in vote is going to be, but it's likely much larger this year than most.  This is going to cause much greater confusion as to who's winning than most years.

Your best bet is probably to watch Florida.  Florida is split into two time zones, so most of Florida ends at 7:00 EST, but the panhandle (which is very conservative) ends at 8:00.  Florida has always had large amounts of mail in voting, so they are well prepared to handle it efficiently, and the difference in mail in voting this year isn't going to be as stark as many other states.  Florida is also a must win for Trump, but he's currently down in the polls there.  If Trump loses Florida he theoretically can still win the presidency, but realistically he has no real chance.  So if Biden is winning in Florida things are very bad for Trump.  If it's close in Florida, or it looks like Trump is winning, then he's still in the game.

Pennsylvania is the tipping point state, so the single most important state to watch, but because of that we probably won't get a call on Pennsylvania until pretty late in the night.  So you might want to watch Michigan instead.  Michigan barely went for Trump in 2016, but is currently polling Biden +8.  If Biden is winning by 8 on election night, then we should be able to tell that fairly early, and such a result makes it highly likely he will end up winning Pennsylvania as well, and therefore the election."
ufc,"If you were going to have 4 fighter tourney it makes since for #1 to fight #4 and take on the winner of #2 vs #3.  We just had a 5 round IC bout between #2 and #3, and #1 and #4 are already scheduled to fight in January.  They aren't likely to cancel Poirier v. McGregor, and they aren't going to wait that long to crown a new champ.  Conor has fought twice in the last 4 years, they aren't going to get him to agree to fight 3 times in less than a year.

The most likely scenario is they just make Poirier v McGregor a championship bout.  If they do then who should get the first shot at the belt after that?  If Poirier wins than the #1 contender will be Gaethje, and Tony still lost recently to Gaethje, it seems Justin is the obvious choice for first title defense, with Tony getting next chance after a tune up fight.  If Conor wins things are a bit weird.  Now you'd have a champion that never beat the champ and who doesn't fight frequently, and a set of top 3 contenders all having lost their last fight, so who knows what happens then."
Askpolitics,"It's easily to check on early voting numbers by declared party and compare that because it's public information.  Demographic information, though, isn't publicly available, so it would require quite a bit of work to answer your question.  It's also going to be nearly impossible to compare early voting in 2020 with 2016, because you can't tell how much of this is enthusiasm to vote versus covid related voting, especially because of how much easier early voting is under the current rules."
ufc,"Dustin is already fighting Conor, and Gaethje just beat Ferguson..  Have the winner of Poirier v McGregor fight Gaethja for the title.  Give Ferguson the first title defense for the winner."
Askpolitics,"Bernie also had huge rallies and lots of fans, and he lost to Biden.  Having a loud fan base does not by itself mean the person is likely to win.  Especially for a guy like Trump who drives more negative support than positive support.  

Also, 46% approval among black voters?  That's either something Trump says with no backing, or a ridiculous outlier poll.  Here are the 3 most recent polls 538 has that give you demographic information.  Trumps approval amongst Black voters is:

Morning Consult (10/23) 16% Approve, 80% Disapprove (72% Strong Disapprove)

YouGov (10/18-20) 15% Approve, 79% Disapprove (72% Strong Disapprove)

QPac (9/22) 6% Approve, 89% Disapprove"
Askpolitics,"Biden has the most consistent lead of any presidential challenger in the last 100 years.  Trump has had a negative approval rating for his entire presidency.  Trump barely scraped by against a massively unpopular opponent last time, and he's less popular now than he was then.  There are very few undecided, and the people voting for Biden are highly certain they are voting for Biden.  There is an ongoing pandemic that Trump is largely blamed for, and the unemployment rate is 7.9%.  Trumps attacks have largely failed to land, and Biden's approval rating has gone up over time.  Trump is out of money, and his party has a lot of seats they need to spread money across to try to defend, while his opponent had the largest fundraising hall of all time, and their main problem is figuring out how to spend their money.  

There are pretty much no positive indicators for Trump, the election is 10 days away, we've already seen record early voting, and we are done with the debate season (which Trump lost after spending so much typing hyping them).  It is not impossible for Trump to win, but he's very much an underdog right now, there is very little time to change that."
Askpolitics,"One more issue is that the house is elected every 2 years, and the senate every 6.  The purpose of this is that the house is expected to work towards shorter term goals, and the senate towards longer term goals, and passing legislation requires balance between the two.  The short term of the house also works as a counter against the president.  The president might come in with a majority, but if the electorate doesn't like the way things are going they can change their mind 2 years in.  If you keep a 6 year term for these senators then you can only slightly shift congress during a midterm election.  You also mentioned the loss small districts, but it has some serious drawbacks.  The first is simply that house members need to respond to a small set of needs.  When there is some local problem that can't be solved by the local government, you can go to your congressperson.  Additionally smaller districts allow for concentrated minorities to get representation.  These could be racial, religious, or just even people that work in a specific industry.  At a state level those will all get merged together and you tend to have people that look more like the majority as the representative."
Ask_Politics,"Historically, when there is a significant minimum wage increase, those that were already near the new rate will see an adjustment as well, just not as large as the people currently at minimum wage.  The reasoning for this is exactly as you said.  In the past you were working a job that was considered much more valuable than minimum wage, and that's still true after the minimum wage increases.  

So, for example, someone who was getting paid $8, would not be getting  $7 increase to $15.  But someone making $10 isn't likely to also just be set at $15, but they also aren't likely to get the full $7, so they might get something in between, like a $6 raise to $16.  This trend will continue past the new minimum wage, so someone making $18 an hour prior, might now make $20-$21.  This effect will fall off pretty fast once the hour rate is significantly above the new minimum wage, and won't effect high wage earners salaries at all.

The minimum wage isn't going to significantly increase the cost of things, even things highly dependent on minimum wage labor.  For example, a Big Mac in Kentucky who uses a minimum wage of $7.25 is, on average, $4.03.  In California, with a $13 minimum wage, the big mac costs $5.11.  And minimum wage isn't likely the sole thing driving this cost, as general cost of living is much higher in California."
Ask_Politics,"This is mostly a reaction to 2016 (or 2000 if they are old enough), where Trump was helped to victory by large amounts of third party voting, which upset Democrats greatly.  This had lead some of them to be of the ""you are either with us or against us"" mentality.  This election is also very heated on both sides, so emotions gets the better of people.  In the end, obviously vote for whoever you want, but if you do say who you are voting for (Biden, Trump, or Other) you should expect the possibility of an angry response."
Ask_Politics,"Trumps taxes are being audited.  Which just means they are being reviewed.  Maybe they are being reviewed simply because they are complex, but more likely Trump is engaged in some very aggressive tax avoidance strategies.  This is especially true if the tax data leaked to the NYT's is correct, as it shows a number of questionable deductions by Trump.  During the audit the IRS accountants and lawyers will determine which deductions Trump is using that they do not believe are correct, and will ask for clarification or additional information to verify whether he was following the law or not.  For example, according to the NYT's Trump used his own daughter as a consultant, and wrote off that as a business expensive.  That is legal to do, as long as he paid his daughter a fair market price.  If he, instead, dumped a bunch of money to his daughter to get a better tax rate, that wouldn't be legal.

Now even if Trump didn't do his taxes correctly, mostly frequently this just requires that Trump pays back the taxes he owes, with a fine and interest due.  It's actually quite difficult to exactly arrest someone for tax fraud, because you have to prove they intentionally defrauded the government, instead of just failed to pay proper taxes, or made a mistake in how things were accounted.  

There is also the possibility that the IRS does not wish to conclude the tax audit while Trump is still president, and is waiting to act until after he is out of office to avoid the appearance of impropriety, or any actual attempt at interference."
Ask_Politics,"For a given election, depending on how you look at it, yes.  It's can be a form of protest, akin to writing in a candidates name, not voting for president, or not voting at all.  It will do nothing to change the actual winner this year though, so it is ""wasted"" in that respect.  Some, maybe even most, 3rd party voters are voting for long term strategic reasons.  They know they are wasting this years vote, but they hope it helps build up 3rd party candidates over time, hopefully to get to a better place in future elections."
Ask_Politics,"A lot of this is a semantic argument about what ""raising taxes"" means, mixed with a bunch of misinformation being spread about what the actual plan is.  The main portion of Biden's tax plan are: Change the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% (which is still lower than the 35% it was in 2016), return the highest bracket tax rate (for those making more than 512k) to it's 2016 value of 39.6%, and treating long term capital gains above $1M in a year as income.  He's also discussed (but I haven't seen a formal plan for) uncapping FICA taxes above certain levels , which would likely create a donut hole so those making less than 400k wouldn't get hit by it.  In that set of proposals Biden is not raising taxes on people making less than 400k.

I've seen a couple of suggestions on how he might end up raising taxes on people below that rate.  The first is he wants to bring back the ACAs individual mandate.  The Obama administration has long argued (including legally in front of the supreme court) that the individual mandate isn't a tax, it's a fine.  But given the way it acts, and the fact that it's account for while doing your taxes, many people treated like a tax.  There is also the weird issue around the individual mandate still being around, but not enforced.  So, if Biden enforces the penalties for the individual mandate again, people without health insurance, including people making under 400k, will owe the government more money.

The second issue is, that by current law, portions of the tax cut and jobs act are set to expire in 2025.  Biden hasn't made clear if he plans to extend the remaining tax cuts, and if so if he plans to do so permanently.  But we don't know who the president will be in 2025 even if Biden wins, nor will we know the makeup of congress.  So if no one does anything, those tax cuts will lapse.  If they lapse than people making less than 400k will have their taxes return to 2016 levels.  Is a failure to act prior to 2025 the same thing as ""increasing taxes""?  And who's fault exactly would it be if no action is taken?  If Biden or some other president did make the cuts permanent do they get to call it a tax cut even though it just affirms the current tax rates?"
Askpolitics,"For any of Bernies idea, radical or otherwise, to become reality he needs a number of things to happen, which are all not certain at this time, making it unlikely that any of his ideas become law, let along the most left wing positions he takes.

1) Biden needs to win the presidency.  This one is looking really good, but it's not a sure thing.

2) Democrats take the Senate and hold the House.  The House is looking near certain right now, while the Senate is looking good.  The Democrats need to net 3, they are almost certain to lose in Alabama, and win in Arizona and Colorado, meaning they need to win 2 more races to get to 50/50.  They are currently winning in Maine, North Carolina, and Iowa.  Maine is the most likely of those three.  North Carolina was looking very good, but a sex scandal by the Democrat has this race tightening.  Iowa was lean Republican not long ago, but has been shifting pretty fast for the Democrats.  There are a number of other seats that are being contested, and are closer than people would have thought, but those are ""win more"" states.  The tipping point in the Senate is most likely Iowa or North Carolina at this point.

3) Democrats remove the filibuster.  This is the biggest single unknown right now, and it leads to massive swings in what will get passed in the next two years.  If the Democrats don't remove or significantly reform the filibuster then they are basically restrict to 1 reconciliation bill per year, and there are limits to what you can pass via reconciliation.  It's highly doubtful any of Bernies core beliefs makes it into a bill before Biden's core policy initiatives.

4) Biden needs to agree.  Biden is not left wing, not even a little bit.  He is willing to accept left wing provisions if they are broadly liked though.  So his platform has moved quite left from where he started.  But even if he agrees he still needs to have the time and capital to push such legislature through.  Biden has talked about things like Tax Reform, Climate Change legislation, a Voting Rights bill, and major changes to Health Care.  Those are all giant things to tackle, so there may not be time to get to parts of Bernies agenda outside of those categories.  Biden really only has 2 guaranteed years to get things passed, then it's time for midterms, where he could lose any Senate majority he does have.

5) Nearly all Democratic Senators need to agree.  That includes conservatives like Manchin, and long term traditionalists like Feinstein.  The larger a majority the Democrats get in the Senate the less important this gets for most legislature, but it's unlikely Bernie can get a 50 person voting block for many of his ideas.  The progressive wing of the Democratic party isn't large enough, and even they might not support some of the more socialist inspired elements of Bernies ideas."
Askpolitics,"A moderate amount, but it's it's a little grandiose to call it a ""Middle East Peace"".  There are two major prongs to Trumps current plans for the Middle East.  The first is to reach some sort of semi-finalized version of a two state plan for Palestine.  This has obviously been tried before, but both sides are really far apart on what they want, making compromise difficult.  Trump isn't trying to be some neutral arbitrator in this process though, he's very overtly supporting Israel and playing hard ball with the Palestinians.  This is the way Trump tends to negotiate.  He tries to apply pressure to force the best deal he can get out of it.  Currently, it's not even really a deal, it's a unilateral declaration by Israel as to what they will accept.  The Palestinians are in a pretty bad spot, as it's not a great deal for them, and their only real play here is to rely on the rest of the Middle East for backing.

That leads to prong two.  Trump is trying to get the various middle eastern countries to normalize relations with Israel, and to support the proposed two state solution.  The main argument here is that Iran is a much more present and dangerous threat than Israel, and that national security issues for these countries should outweigh more abstract concerns like pan-Arabic unity around Palestine.  It also looks like the US is willing to throw in military aid and potential support, if they agree.

So far there has been some success to this approach.  It's still pretty early, because what we are seeing is less like a formal agreement, and more like an indication that they are willing to negotiate.  If this does work the way Trump wants it to, and the middle east countries decide they can work with Israel, and they can work with the Palestinians to accept terms that are fairly pro-israel, then this will be a pretty significant short term foreign policy win for the US.  The Palestinians get kind of thrown under the bus in this scenario, but it might just be the reality of the situation and they accept it.  But, we aren't there yet, since the issue of Israeli annexation is very much not a done deal, so we could still end up somewhere between the deal completely failing apart on one side, and an unpleasant (for most parties) but acceptable deal on the other.  What it's not going to be is a kumbaya new era of peace in the middle east though."
Ask_Politics,"One of the thing that attracts people to Biden is that he's a placeholder for ""return to normalcy"".  They don't like Trump, and they especially don't like his antics, so they would not be happy with Biden if he engaged in that kind of response.  Further, as a general rule, when one candidate is popular and one candidate is unpopular, the unpopular candidate will engage in mudslinging.  This lowers their approval more most of the time, but they are already unpopular so it doesn't hurt them that bad, and they are just hoping it lowers the popular candidates approval by more.  Most of the time the best course of action is for the popular candidate to try to stay above the fray.  Even defending themselves from any accusations keeps those accusations in the news and is bad for them, so best bet is to dismiss, ignore, and downplay the whole thing.  Maybe they send a surrogate to fight back a bit, but the candidate themself wants to stay out of the mud."
Ask_Politics,"There is a reason we simply ignore non-scientific polling like this.  It frequently has massive bias because it doesn't use a randomized sample.  The margins can be very large depending on who the audience for the poll is.  If you put up a poll on the NRA website and the Greenpeace website, any question you ask is likely to get completely different answers.  Additional, opt in polls are very susceptible to brigading.  It could be bots, but most of the time it's just that people that have a vested interest in a poll supporting their views will share that poll with others that support their views and not with people that don't support their views.  So even if you if you started on a fairly even distribution if one side is really interesting in ""winning"" that particular poll, they will push more people to vote."
Askpolitics,"Most likely Biden.  His polling lead has been large on the national and state level, and steady for a very long time.  There are very few undecided voters.  The presidents approval rating is low, and has been for a long time, and is tilted very strongly towards strong disapprove.  Biden's approval rating is positive and has been growing, which suggests that Trumps attacks aren't working so far.  We are done with the debate season, and it does not look like it helped Trump, so there is little time or opportunity at this point for Trump to make up ground.  It's hard to figure what a fundamentals approach to predicting the election would be, because the combination of a pandemic with a massive and swift economic shock is uncharted territory."
Ask_Politics,"Generally it should be a good thing (or more specifically a less bad thing) for overall debt.  When you are in a recession the economy isn't running efficiently.  A quick injection of stimulus money (in the right places) can often significantly shorten the recession.  That is both a benefit to the population as a whole, and it causes government revenues to return faster (since total tax income goes down in a recession as well).  So if done correctly, the stimulus pays for itself.  But this only works in a recession, and only to a certain degree.  If you give too much stimulus, or stimulus when the economy doesn't need it, you are actually creating new inefficiency instead of solving existing ones, and you end up spending more on stimulus than you recoup in economic benefit."
Askpolitics,"People are ""obsessed"" about Hunter because it's one of the main avenues of attack that Trump is using against Biden.  So he's trying to make it the biggest story it possibly can be.  It's not like it was unexpected, this has been Trumps main attack against Biden for over a year now.  There have been plenty of news about Trumps children as well, but it's been spread out over the last 4 years, and isn't something that Biden is pushing heavily.  So it's not like the Trump kids have gone completely under the radar."
Ask_Politics,"Executive orders carry a lot of different functions.  As others have said, they are limited in scope to things the president already has the power to do, either through inherent constitutional authority, or more likely through federal legislation.  So the president can't create something fully out of whole cloth, but there is still a lot of power vested in the presidency, and relatively simple executive orders can effect a lot of people.  

So what does this executive order do? Well...nothing.  It literally does nothing.  You can read the full order [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-america-first-healthcare-plan/).  You may notice that Section 1 of the order, which goes into the purpose of  giving the order, is 3,614 words long.  Section 2, which is the actual policy is the following 45 words:

>It has been and will continue to be the policy of the United States to give Americans seeking healthcare more choice, lower costs, and better care and to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.

There is no legal weight to these words.  Its just a policy statement made in the form of an executive order.  The rest of the order goes on to direct various parts of the US government to ""maintain and build upon existing actions"" to do a number of things (expand access to healthcare, expand access to medicine, ensure access to price information).  It doesn't make any changes to existing policies, and only vaguely informs the government to keep doing good stuff that it was already doing."
Askpolitics,"No.  Trump did run with a large amount of populist rhetoric in 2016.  He routinely talked about the corruption of ""the swamp"", and turned his lack of political experience into an outsider mystique.  He fought hard to win over blue color voters, promising a return to the days of good paying jobs, and a government that focused on people.  But since winning he really didn't lead any kind of effort to enact populist policy.  Instead he left most policy decisions up to the republican establishment, with occasional input or tweaking from Trump.  Instead Trump has been more focused on building a cult of personality.  His rhetoric now is ""I'm the only one that can fix things"" and ""look at the economy that only I could build"".  The Republican party platform is literally reduced to ""re-elect Trump"".  The republican electorate went very deep into this cult of personality, to a degree you just didn't see with Reagan, Post-9/11 Bush, or Obama.  So while people were expecting Trump to potentially pull Republicans towards populist positions like infrastructure spending, or changes to health care, those things never happened."
Askpolitics,"The burden of any tax ultimate falls on people.  So while the corporate entity might pay more taxes, the burden of the tax falls on one of three groups:  the employees of the corporation (in the form of decreased wages and benefits), the shareholders of the corporation (in the form of decreased stock value), or the consumers of the goods and services of that corporation (in the form of higher prices).  What percentage of the tax hike goes to which of those groups is partially determined by market dynamics, but also by the executives at that corporations.  Taxing corporations also leads to market inefficiencies due to tax avoidance and compliance costs.  This is why many of the larger world economies have been steadily decreasing their corporate taxes over time.

What you can do instead of raising corporate taxes, is raise a tax that specifically targets one of those three groups.  This accomplishes the same goal, but with finer control on where the burden ends up, and allows for making the tax progressive in scale.  If you want to tax employees you increase income taxes, if you want to tax shareholders you increase the capital gains tax, if you want to tax consumers you increase consumption taxes (sales tax/VAT).  Even though this makes a lot of sense economically, you often see pushes to increase Corporate taxes because they are easier to sell politically.  People don't like to pay taxes, it's only natural, but psychologically they don't mind taxation as much if it's indirect and hidden from them.  People might spend a lot of time worrying about the highest level income tax bracket they fall into, but if they aren't self employed they probably don't worry about employer side FICA taxes, even though that significantly impacts their salary, but in a hidden way."
Askpolitics,"The proper way you would test a probabilistic model like this would be to determine if the candidate they think wins 29% of the time actually did win close to 29% of the time.  For 538 we have 3 election to base a conclusion on.  That's just not enough data to prove that the model is giving you precise results.  

We can be fairly confident in the 538 model not based on its short history, but based on its methodology. We have a pretty good idea of how well polling has done historically, and we know an aggregate polling model should do pretty well because of that.  But if you were asked between 538, The Economist, and Niskanen, who's model is more precise you can't really determine that yet."
NoStupidQuestions,"The same reasons any biological entity is the way it is, natural selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift.

Natural selection is when a trait gives you a survival advantage, therefore making it more likely for that variant of a gene (an allele) to survive and make it to further generations.  When you see differences in humans frequently it's because the trait has tradeoffs and is more valuable in certain locales than others.  For example, darker skin decreases your ability to absorb Vitamin D, but decreases your odds of getting skin cancer.  Places near the equator have lots of direct sunlight, which means skin cancer is a big risk, and Vitamin D deficiency is not very prevalent.  The further north or south you move, though, the less direct sunlight you get, and the balance of favorability between darker skin and lighter skin starts to favor lighter skin.

Sexual selection is where a trait makes you more desirable as a mate, thereby increasing your odds of passing down that trait to others, even if they don't directly help you survive.  Birds are the kings of these kinds of traits, with complex singing, dancing, and coloration all meant to attract a mate.  In humans things get quite complex, but we do notice that sometimes unique traits are considered desirable.  This is one of the reasons we might see rarer eye colors surviving.  Those color difference probably don't have a significant effect on your survival odds, but may make you stand out in a crowd.  The value of these rare colors decreases as their frequency increases, so the naturally tend to balance out at level where they remain rare, but won't disappear fully.

Genetic drift is just the fairly large effect that random chance has on survival.  If you have two versions of a gene, and they are almost identical, which one wins is pretty much a 50/50 coin flip.  But even alleles that give an advantage aren't guaranteed to survive.  Even if it gives a significant advantage, maybe you just get unlucky and die without passing it on.  Also with a 50/50 coin flip, sometimes that coin comes up heads a whole bunch of times in a row.  This can cause a version of a gene to become ""fixed"" (to be the only version left) even if it's not strictly better than the other versions that were floating around in the gene pool.  This may be what causes the epicanthic fold in asians (the slight bit of skin that covers the corner of the eye that gives their eyes a slightly different look).  There are some potential natural selection reasons for it existing, but it's more likely that it's due to something called the founder effect.  Basically in very large groups genetic drift doesn't do very much.  It's what happens if you flip millions of coins, things will tend to average out, and the more survivable traits will win out.  But if you have a small group of immigrants move into a new area, they may have some unique mutations that manage to become fixed in the small population (it's easier to get lucky on 10 flips of the coin than a million).  So the humans that first moved into that region might have brought that trait with them by chance, and it just grew as the population grew."

Ask_Politics,"It's very easy to come up with models that properly ""predicts"" all prior elections after the fact.  It's highly likely that such a model is overfit though, meaning it's actually ability to predict the future properly is extremely limited.  Additionally there is no such thing as an ""AI that predicts elections"".  That's going to be someone's attempt at marketing an election model, but there isn't enough data to do any kind of machine learning/deep learning kind of approach to presidential elections.  You should be very cautious about the predictions of any individual or model.  It's better to try to understand how the model is modeling things, and why it thinks it's prediction is likely to be true."
Askpolitics,"There is no constitutional concept of an ""unlawful president"".  Impeachment does nothing to retroactively remove decisions by the president prior to removal from office.  You could impeach the justice themselves, but you'd need the senate to agree to a ""high crime or misdemeanor"" being committed by the justice, not by the president that nominated them."
Askpolitics,"Not for a federal law.  That would completely circumvent the checks and balances of the court.  The proper way to do that is to make a constitutional amendment, but that's politically very difficult (for good reason)."
Askpolitics,"Presidential election forecasting is a difficult thing.  They don't happen very frequently, the amount of polling we have today and the skill of the pollsters is relatively new, the entire dynamic of elections changes over decades of time, and the Electoral college makes things much harder to predict.  Then once you've had an election how do you determine if the model did a good job or not?  In 2016 538 predicted Trump had a 29% chance to win the election.  This was much higher than other models and pundits thought the election was, but the person they predicted to win lost?  So did they get the election right or wrong?

So, yes, 538 is usually considered the standard for presidential election modeling, and that's probably correct, but it's hard to prove their reliability, or determine if they really are the best.  So don't let the specificity of ""87% likelihood of Biden winning"" make you overconfident in the prediction, but accept that the current situation is highly favorable to Biden.  Think of it more like a football game.  Biden had an early lead for the entire game.  He's slightly increased his lead, but more importantly, the clock is starting to run out on Trump.  Right now we are in the last half of the 4th quarter, but this is where Trump is going to start to throw Hail Mary's and try onside kicks.  Those are unlikely to work, but every once in awhile someone makes a big comeback.  We won't be in the ""just need to kneel to run out the clock and win"" mode until well into election night, and maybe not until days latter when we get enough of the ballots counted to be sure."
Askpolitics,"So the NY Post released a story that purports to contain emails from Hunter Biden that suggests that he was selling access to his father while he was Vice President.  The emails come from a hard drive given to the Post by Rudy Giuliani.  This hard drive is alleged to be from Hunter Bidens laptop, given to Giuliani by the owner of a repair shop.  Supposedly Biden dropped off the laptop, then forgot to ever reclaim it, and after the owner realized what he had he gave it to Giuliani.

The story immediately came under fire, and Facebook and Twitter started to block the story.  This in turn caused a counter reaction by those that say that the story was being silenced.  Questions have been raised as to the veracity of Giuliani's claims and that his story seems to have changed with regard to how he received the laptop.

There have likewise been stories about the story being shopped around to Fox News and them passing because they didn't trust the validity of the story.  As well there are claims that the major journalists at the Post didn't want the story either, and the main writers didn't want the byline on the finished story.

We are still pretty earlier in the meta-story around the story itself, so it's not real clear were it is going."
Askpolitics,"All of the indications so far are not actually criminal in nature, they more suggest the possibility of something vaguely nefarious.  If Biden were lying about meeting with the executives, that might suggest he's hiding something about those meetings."
explainlikeimfive,"Humans brains (and really all animal brains) are horrible at calculating things, but they are really good at estimating things.  For example, if you give a human a road map and it has two points on it, and you ask them to draw a fast path between those two points they can pretty effortlessly draw you a path.  But if you ask them to find the absolute fastest path, even with all with each portion of the map having how long it would take to travel on it, it would take the human a very hard time getting to the absolutely correct answer.  Now it's likely that our first quick guess was probably pretty close though, within maybe 5 or 10 percent of the correct answer.  The entire reason for that is that from evolutions point of view finding a good answer fast is way way better than finding a perfect answer slowly.  So our brains are completely optimized to solve specific types of problems that we ran into over and over again, and come up with the ""fuzzy"" answer for how to deal with it.

Consider for a moment a tree climbing animal, like a squirrel, that will from time to time leap from one tree branch to another.  Now consider all the actual calculations you'd need to do to do that correctly.  To figure out how much they need to compress their needs, how hard and fast to flex their muscles, how high to jump, how far the tree branch is.  There is a reason why we are just now, with all of our computer power, starting to make robots that can walk up a flight of stairs, or jump across a small gap.  The calculations to perform those actions are ridiculously complex, but our brains are built to just do them naturally."

So while we are the most intelligent of the species on earth, it's not likely that we are in a wholly different category of intelligence than other animals, just on the far end of the spectrum."
Askpolitics,"Let's split this into three questions:

Could Trump win without any of the things you listed, in a 100% fair election?  Yes, but the odds are very slim.  If you look back at the 2016 election without blinders on, even without considering the possibility of a lucky polling error in his favor, people should have been way less confident in a Hillary win.  Because of that, people are now overcorrecting in the opposite direction and thinking that Trump has a better chance than he does.  If the election was held today Trump would probably have somewhere in the 5%.  That's not zero, but that's obviously not good at all.  Even with a polling error even larger than 2016 it's just not going to make up a 10% lead.  So Trump really needs something to radically change in the last few weeks to have a real chance.

Could Trump win with ""dirty tricks""? Yes, but it won't help all that much.  Things like voter roll purging, making it hard to vote, long voting lines in cities, those things have been going on for a long time.  But they aren't that impactful at the presidential level.  They are much worse in red states, and it's more about them retaining control at the state level.  Such tactics in can effect swing states, but their impact is limited.  They could turn a close race, but most of the races aren't close right now.

Could Trump win with overt fraud?  Yes, obviously, but it won't help.  For one thing the risks of outright fraud are limited.  Voting is actually controlled at a very low level, and the president can't just stop peopling from voting in Pennsylvania without a lot of help from Pennsylvanians at all levels of government.  He also couldn't do it without it being obvious that the vote is fraudulent.  At which point we'd be talking about an attempted coup, and you are on to a whole other discussion.  But more, Trump isn't really trying to cheat to win.  He's trying to create doubt in the result so that he can explain away his loss and keep his base intact after the election."
Ask_Politics,"Probably not very much.  Traditionally these kind of ""inside baseball"" partisan fights don't tend to actually effect the electorate much.  The Republicans didn't really pay a price for increasing usage of filibuster, the Democrats didn't pay for using the nuclear option on judicial nominations, and Republicans didn't pay for running out the clock on the Garland nomination.  It's also likely that the ACB nomination this close to an election won't bite the republicans.  By the time the next election is occurring something more recent and easier to understand will be the thing that drives the narrative.  None of those things will poll well when directly asked about, but it isn't something people consider when actually voting, so there isn't much of a political cost to the action."
Ask_Politics,"So the timing here is important. The oligarch that owns Burisma is Mykola Zlochevsky.  Zlochevsky was very corrupt from what we can tell, and at the time Ukraine was a fairly corrupt country.   In 2012 an investigation started into allegations of him for money laundering and tax evasion.  In 2014 a series of violent clashes leads to the overthrow of the government.  New elections take place and a new anti-corruption president, Petro Poroshenko, wins in a landslide.  Zlochevsky sees the writing on the wall and tries to clean up his act.  He gives board seats to westerners, including Hunter Biden, to show that's his company is now corruption free.  But Zlochevsky was still under investigation for his pre-2012 activities, not just inside Ukraine, but by the US and EU.  In 2015 Victor Shokin takes over as the prosecutor general and inherits the case against Burisma.  The British are trying to work with Shokin to obtain information for their own court cases, but he wasn't being helpful.  In fact it looks like Shokin was slow playing the investigation while attempting to solicit bribes from Zlochevsky.  Eventually everyone gets tired of this game, and the US, the EU, and the Internationally Monetary Fund start to pressure Ukraine's government to ditch Shokin, which they do."
Askpolitics,"It isn't always this tense, but it's also not a unique phenomenon.  I think the Obama years were actually pretty calm, even though we had a lot of partisan bickering.  The 2004 election was quite tense though.  We were still in hot war in Iraq, the Abu Gharib scandal was recent, there was Gitmo, CIA black sites, extraordinary rendition, and enhanced interrogation.  All of that contrasted against patriotism and presidential support from 9/11.  The 2000 campaign was pretty tame, until you got the craziness of election night itself and the electoral and legal battles that came after.  You can also go back to the Vietnam War era politics that were very tense for an number of elections."
Ask_Politics,"If you have a first past the post voting system, the natural balance is to have two big tent parties.  So it's likely that the next president that's not a Democrat or Republican would be because either the Democrats or the Republicans (or both) no longer exist.  Maybe it's possible for a singular charismatic candidate with a lot of money (like a better version of Ross Perot) to individually win a 3 way race, but that doesn't really create a 3rd party.  There is just no stable way to have 3 parties vying for the presidency.  Any time a third party might start growing one of the two existing parties (or both) would adopt the popular portions of that platform to grow their own share of the electorate."
Askpolitics,"First you start with the sample.  This should be as random as possible.  Usually this is something like a random phone number dial.  If you hit a land line (which is becoming less and less of a problem) where more than one person uses the same number you ask an additional question like ""Can I speak to the adult of the house that has had the most recent birthday"".  For the ones that agree to the poll you ask some demographic questions (race, sex, etc) and then the actual polling questions.

Second comes the weighting.  Some groups of people just don't answer the phone as frequently, or don't want to talk to pollsters.  But the people that don't or won't answer a pollster still agree heavily with people of the same demographics that will answer the phone.  So for example, non-college educated individuals tend to answer pollsters less frequently than college or above educated individuals.  So what they do is look at the true demographics of the target audience (so the demographics of the US for example) and they give more weight to the groups that are under represented.  This basically means the person who answers the phone ""votes"" for the person who didn't answer the phone.

Finally, for election polls they have to do a likely voter screen.  Basically they need to figure out if the person is likely to vote for not.  You can simply ask people if they are likely to vote, but that doesn't actually give you the best results.  So they tend to use questions like if they are registered to vote, when the last time they voted, mixed with demographic voting trends to try to predict what the voting electorate would look like."
Ask_Politics,"So the major failure in most peoples thinking in the run up to the election, was that the ""blue wall"" was uncrackable, and that gave Clinton a safe base that made her election easy.  Basically that the states that Democrats had been winning consistent for the last 20 years were going to go Democrat again, and didn't need to be heavily defended heavily.  That includes Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  RCP's average for those three states right before the election were:

Wisconsin Clinton +6.5

Michigan Clinton +3.4

Pennsylvania Clinton +1.9

As a rule of thumb you consider anything inside the margin of error (around 3.5% normally) as basically a tossup.  That's overstating the actual odds of being off by that far, but it's a rule of thumb.  Additionally state polling tends to be off by significantly more than national polling, because there are less total polling to put into an aggregate, the pollsters are lower quality, and there is greater time lag between polling which misses late surges (like Trump had).  It's why looking at the national vote helps you calibrate your expectation for how the states are likely to turn out.

So Clinton, the day before the election is within the margins at the national level, and two of her ""unbreakable firewall states"" were tossups.  There was also lots of undecideds, and her support was soft due to her weak favorability numbers.  This is why 538 had Trump at 29% to win.  Clinton was ahead at the moment, with all the information we had, but she wasn't anywhere near a safe lead.  538 didn't know that there was going to be a correlated polling error in the rust belt due to under representing non-college whites, they just knew that such errors can and due happen, and if one happened Trump could still win.  

So, getting back to 2020.  The likely swing state for Biden (Pennsylvania) is polling at 7.0%, he's up nationally by 10.6%, and there are very few undecideds.  His opponent is extremely dislike, and a near majority of americans say they absolutely would not vote for him.  Trump is fighting a once in a 100 year pandemic and economic shock like nothing we've seen in modern times.  He had to fire his campaign manager, and he's running low on money while his opponent has the largest single month money haul in history, and is having problems figuring out how he can even spend that much money.

So this is a fundamentally different race than 2016.  Also, the exact error that happened in 2016 (under-counter non-college white) isn't likely to happen because the phenomenon is better understood now, but an error of the same caliber as the 2016 error wouldn't be enough to turn the race around for Trump, he'd still lose.  Trump needs to get down to around 5% deficit in national polling, then still get very luckily on a polling miss in his favor.

People learned the the wrong lesson in 2012, thinking that aggregate polling was perfect.  Then they learned the wrong lesson in 2016, thinking that polls just don't work anymore."
Ask_Politics,"Probably not.  There is a long history of the candidate who is behind in polling to suggest that polling isn't correct.  In 2004 Kerry proponents were talking about the ""cell phone effort"" undercounting his supporters.  In 2012 it was that the polls were ""skewed"" with too many democrats, and if you just unskewed the polls you would see that Romney was actually going to win.  

So now we get the ""silent majority"", which seems to be a combination of ""polls said Hillary was 97%, so Trump will win again"" and ""I don't trust polls, but have you seen the latest Rasmussen?"".  There is not any real evidence of a ""shy Trump"" effect in 2016.  There was a lack of weighting be education in 2016, that lead to undercounting Trump voters (especially in places with a larger than average number of non-college weights).  But that wasn't due specifically to people not being willing to say they support Trump, it had to do with demographic modeling that didn't work well for this election.  But that's something you can easily identify, quantify, and correct for, so it doesn't make it more likely to undercount Trump in 2020.  

But the real kicker here is, Hillary was polling at 3.2% late, with a large number of undecideds, and an EC that currently favors republicans by around 2-3%.  That means even a small mistake could turn the whole election.  Biden is at 10.6%, and Trump hasn't been within 3% at any point in the last year.  A 2016 size polling error wouldn't help trump here, he would need a massive polling failure.  Even that is unlikely to do it, so he really needs some major news going his way, along with a massive polling error, just to get back to his narrow 2016 win condition."
Ask_Politics,"It depends heavily on what ""magic"" caused them to win.  A third party candidate is highly unlikely but there are differences in how it might occur.

It could be based on a single personality and a split electorate (like if Ross Perot had broken through and been popular enough to win).  This is likely to be with a very populist and probably centralist kind of rhetoric that can steal from both parties enough to win.

Or it could be happen in the middle of a realignment, where one or both parties are falling apart and either readjusting their platforms, or not being able to and new parties take their place.  Akin to the 1850's-1860's with realignment around slavery and the destruction of the Whigs.  In this case it's more of a case of the parties realigning to the will of the electorate.

Or maybe a regional based third party completely dominates in one particularly part of the country, and forms a stable 3rd party (akin to the Scottish Nationalist Party in the UK, or the Bloc Québécois in Canada).

What you aren't going to see, though, is a Liberterian/Green candidate, winning the presidency with ""radical views"" that aren't acceptable to the majority of Americans.    You are going to need to be broadly popular to even have a shot at the presidency, and that means you views need to be palatable to a large number of Americans."
Askpolitics,">Is it more common to take the job for life, or retire?

Retirement is more common, but it's still somewhat frequent for judges to die in office.

>Pres. Trump may end up nominating 1/3 of the SCOTUS within his first term. Is there a limit on noms per term?

No.  3 is unusual for a single term, but the first one should have gotten filled on Obama's tenure, and the 3rd one isn't filled yet and came very late, so just happenstance that he got that one.

>Hypothetically, Trump could get 0 votes next month but could have 1/3 of the SCOTUS which champion his beliefs for the next 40+ years

Yes.  That's just how it works.  Jimmy Carter didn't get a supreme court opening during his term, which lead to 11 straight Republican SC appointments between Nixon and George Bush Sr. 

>Why don't parties replace elderly judges, like RBG, to ""secure"" the seat. In theory a party could win a presidential election once every 20 years but still maintain a majority indefinitely?

Supreme Court justices are given lifetime appointments, and the judge themselves decide when they are done.  RBG could have retired late in Obama's term, but McConnell was already blocking a SC nomination, so it wouldn't have done anything.  It's not up to the party to decide.

>Why don't they 'just' serve 36 years, with the incoming President nominating a justice (retirements / deaths handled by original nominating party)

This idea has been discussed, but it to have any long lasting value it would need to be made into a constitutional amendment.  Anything short of that could simply be undone when the next major appointment comes up.  But an amendment would be very difficult to get done.  They always are, but especially right now because republicans won't want to make any changes to the court."
Askpolitics,"Whether a president can or cannot be arrested isn't settled law.  The Department of Justice has a general belief that they should not move forward on federal charges against a sitting president, and given that the President is the head of the executive branch, it's hard to see how they would even go about doing that (and even if they did it would likely spark a constitutional crisis).  Since President Trump will be president until at least the morning of  Wednesday January 21st (inauguration day), it's highly unlikely he would be arrested before that date.  

Even after that, there is good reason to believe that Biden wouldn't move forward with any charges against Trump on the federal level.  To do so would create a political firestorm, and completely overwhelm anything Biden would like to do as president.  This doesn't present state level charges from being filed against him, and it seems like NY is preparing to do so as soon as he leaves office."
Askpolitics,"I wrote a detailed response to the question ""should I trust polls"", so if you want a long read here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask\_Politics/comments/j7zkwl/do\_you\_trust\_the\_polls\_prior\_to\_the\_election/g89zmow?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/j7zkwl/do_you_trust_the_polls_prior_to_the_election/g89zmow?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

But the short answer is, polling was pretty good in 2016 actually.  The national polls were quite good, state polls were ok, except in the rust belt, where they missed on the far end of normal.  The problem in 2016 was that clinton had a tiny lead on election day.  Here polling average was 3.2%, which is already within the margin of error for a popular vote loss.  But worse, republicans currently have an advantage in the EC normally around 2-3%.  That's why Trump lost the national vote by 2.1% and still won the election.  That kind of polling miss is really common, which is one of a number of reasons people shouldn't have been confident that Clinton would win at all.  But Biden isn't at 3.2%, he's currently at 10.6%.  So a polling miss of the same type as 2016 would turn a massive Biden win into a large Biden win.  Trump really needs something huge to move the needle or he doesn't have much of a chance.  That chance won't ever be 0%, but it's currently not very likely."
Ask_Politics,"Since 1976, if you look at polling 25 days out (like we are now), they are, on average, within 3.14% of the final national vote. So, as a rule, polling this to the election is generally a pretty good indicator of who's going to get the most votes, unless the election is already pretty close.  Predicting who's going to win the electoral college, though, is more complex.  This is were election models (which often use polls, but aren't the same thing as polls) come in.  Polls themselves never predict who's going to win the EC.  When it comes to models, there are some pretty good models and a whole bunch of really bad models.  The 538 model, specifically, got a lot of good press because in the 2008 and 2012 elections they correctly predicted the winner of each state with the sole exception of Indiana in 2008.  But that lead to lots of people creating and promoting their own models that weren't very good.  There is also the inherent problem that we just don't have a lot of data on presidential elections, because they don't happen frequently enough.  So it's hard to know who is making a good model and who's making a bad one, but the one's based on sound statistical footing, and with a good understanding of historic polling trends, do better than others.

Here are the actual mistakes that cause people to be so sure that Trump was going to lose, and who made them:

Polls:

* Did not weight by education, so they missed the non-college vs college white split.  Since not everyone answers polls at the same rate (this is called non-response bias), you need to weight your polls to account for that.  In 2016 most people were not taking education levels into account for this though, so while Trump was doing massively better with non-college whites that trend got missed, and their non-response rate lead to undercounting them in polls.  This is especially important because the rust belt swing states have much higher level of non-college whites than the national average.  This caused a significant miss in the swing state polling.  This was figured out after the fact, which has lead most pollsters to weight by education now, and they had the 2018 elections to test and calibrate, so we should be fairly confident that this particular mistake won't happen in 2020.

Models:

* Treated states like they were independent.  Basically you need to understand how polls actually work, how precise they are, and importantly how they fail.  So these models might know that states polling is sometimes wrong, but they thought that while Pennsylvania might be wrong, or Michigan might be wrong, Clinton could afford to loose either of them, so she was still going to win.  The problem with that is that when polling is wrong it's unlikely that it's simply wrong about a single state (except in some of the more eclectic states like Alaska).  So the weighting mistake that made the polls be off in Pennsylvania also made them wrong in Michgan, and models simply didn't think that was likely to happen.  In 2020 we have more models that think about this the right way.  In fact when Niskanen released their model this year that still presumed state polling was independent it got so thoroughly destroyed by twitter that they shut the model down the same day.
* Was too confident in state polling.  National election polling has a much better track record than state level polling, and some state polling is done by smaller polling groups and groups with less of a historic track record.  State polling also happens less frequently, so it tends to miss late breaking trends more .  As such, getting a result of Clinton +4.5 is way different if it's in a state with 10 high quality recent polls, than one with 4 mediocre ones.  So the odds of the actual results being Trump +1 (or Clinton +10) are way higher in the state with low quality polls than the state with the high quality polls.  We have a lot more models in 2020, and people have been learning from their mistakes in 2016, to better internalize the probability of error.

Pundits:

* Let their personal feelings about Trump drive their predictions.  Many people in the media just could not believe that someone like Trump could possibly win, and there was almost no data that would have changed their minds.
* Treated 80% as 100%.  People are really bad at understanding that just because something isn't the most likely is not the same as it's impossible.  If I told you that the odds of Trump winning in 2020 was only 15% (what Nate Silver's model says today) you might think that means he has no chance, but that's roughly the same odds of playing russian roulette and losing.  Even with the rather huge lead Biden has at the moment, we shouldn't pretend like he can't possibly win.
* Listening to bad models.  There are lots of models out there, and a whole bunch of them are rubbish. It's very easy to make a model, and because it's actually pretty easy to predict who's likely to win the presidency, especially when you give yourself a pass when the winner of the EC is different than the national popular vote.
* Chasing the outlier.  Pundits love to talk about ""surprising"" polls.  Polls that are surprising are usually wrong, but nobody writes an article about how the latest poll confirms what the past 4 polls were all saying.  This gives a very distorted feeling for how the race is actually going."
Askpolitics,"You are correct, I overstated the issue.  But she would not only need the support of the of republicans in congress, she would need it to be signed into law by the president, or a veto proof majority in both houses.  Everyone knows there is no way in hell that's going to happen, which returns to my point that this is about optics, not legislature."
Askpolitics,"Pelosi, and the house have no authority to invoke the 25th amendment.  They also have no feasible path to change that outside of a constitutional amendment, which they aren't talking about, and have 0% chance to actual enact.  

So, any explanation for why Pelosi is doing what she's doing can't be based on the belief that she's actually going to try to remove a president via this mechanism.  It will have all the same power as a strongly worded tweet.  So, she must be doing this for optics.  I'm not exactly sure why she thought this was a good play politically, but presumably she thinks just keeping the 25th amendment up for discussion is good for democrats and bad for Trump."
Askpolitics,"If the Democrats get a majority in the Senate, but the filibuster remains, then they will be limited.  They can pass 1 (technically 2, but in reality 1) major piece of legislation via reconciliation each year.  That's what the Republicans did with the 2018 tax bill, and what they were trying to do with the 2017 ACA repeal.  Otherwise they need to negotiate with Republicans.  Given the push towards filibuster removal though, there is the possibility that the threat of using the nuclear option causes the Republicans to back down on their use of filibuster, if they feel like keeping it in a more limited usage is better than losing it altogether."
Askpolitics,"You could accomplish the exact same thing as the mandate if you simply raised everyone's taxes by the same cost of the mandate, then gave everyone a tax rebate for health care costs up to the mandate level.  The fact that the mandate is really just a reformatted tax is exactly why Roberts ruled it constitutional.  The reason the republicans fought to kill the ACA, and then kill the mandate, had nothing to do with them not liking the mandate.  It has to do with them not wanting ACA to work so they could get rid of it, and they tried to chip away at it as much as possible.

The mandate, or any other market based solution, is a compromise, because the alternates are either a public option or a single payer solution, but of which are much more liberal than the current system.  

Back to your original question though, the reason Biden wants to return the mandate is because he prefers augmenting the ACA instead of replacing it with a single payer solution, and the mandate is an important mechanism for making the ACA work."
Askpolitics,"I mean the obvious answer is he doesn't want to actually go outside to shoot.  That could be because it was shot when the lighting was poor, or because he didn't want to be out where he could be filmed by others or asked questions, or it could be that he's sick enough they don't want to tax him and are doing the simplest things possible.  But whichever of those answers (or others) it might be, none of that seems to matter very much.

The fact that it is so obviously a green screen suggests they aren't really working too fool people with it."
Askpolitics,"They could, and that's what a medicare for all style approach would do.  But the mandate was an attempt to use a market drive approach, which was meant as a compromise with the republicans.  The 1993 Republican health care plan, and 2006 Mitt Romney plan for Massachusetts both use a mandate.  I'm not sure if they thought that a mandate might be more popular than a direct tax increase or not, but neither of them are particularly popular.  So mandates are good policy, but can be bad politics, which is why it's been used as a cudgel against obamacare since it's release."
Askpolitics,"[ballotpedia.com](https://ballotpedia.com) does a pretty good of trying to present as much information as possible about various political candidates.  It tries to draw from the public statements from the candidates as much as possible.  You can view their presidential information here: [https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential\_candidates,\_2020](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_candidates,_2020)"
Askpolitics,"It looks pretty obvious that he is in his most recent video, but I'm not sure why that means anything important, or would effect peoples votes at all."
Askpolitics,"Lack of a mandate will drive healthy people out of the market.  This will lead to increased cost for those remaining, which will then start to price people out of the market, which will lead to a death spiral.  This is especially true because the ACA removed pre-existing restrictions, so people can wait until they get sick, then get insurance.

Basically it's not any different than just having a health insurance tax (like we already have for Medicare) but using market dynamics instead of a tax plus a rebate."
Askpolitics,Then I still don't understand the question.  Do you mean what colors are associated with liberalism?
Askpolitics,"They intentionally all how powers in different ways such that no one of them is most powerful.  

The executive has the benefit of being controlled by a single individual, and that individual can act instantly on a wide range of issues.  But they are limited in that they can't create something new, and if they step over the line the courts will cut them off.  They are also the only one with a term limit, which limits how much and individual can do.  

The courts have a tendency to have the longest lasting power.  A single court case can change politics for 50 or more years.  They have a relatively small group of people making decisions, and each individual doesn't have to worry about elections, and can be a part of the court for a very long time.  But the courts also act slowly, and are reactionary.  They have to wait until things come up before their court before they can act, and they can't create something new.

In theory the legislative is the most power because of one simple fact.  They have the power of impeachment.  If you had a fully unified congress they could impeach the president and vice president, replacing them with the speaker of the house, then impeach all 9 SC justices and remake the courts to their whims.  But there are 535 members of congress, and that means it's damn near impossible to get all of them to agree together to do something that large.  Additionally, the majority of them are always up for reelection within 2 years, so anything they do could lead to a very quick electoral change of leadership."
Askpolitics,"The center generally is more important than the left/right, especially in this election.  This election is very much about both sides being fired up to vote, and fighting over the middle.  Especially the Obama-Trump voters from 2016.  That's where Biden is targeting heavily, and he's relying on others (Bernie, AOC, etc) to help drive young people, and especially first time voters."
Askpolitics,"If you voted or not, and your party affiliation, along with any large donations to politicians, are public information.  Who you voted for is not, and you don't have to vote for the party you are affiliated with, nor do you need to be affiliated with a party to vote in the general elections."
Askpolitics,"Are you talking about the Statue of Liberty?  If so, it's made of copper and it's original color was simply copper.  The green color is because of oxidation on the outside of the statue, but people thought it was a pleasing color, so we didn't try to remove or paint over it."
Askpolitics,"Bernie wants to move his political positions forward, like any other politician.  The easiest way he can do that is be growing a social democrat wing inside the Democratic party, and to do that he needs to work with the party leadership.  So far Bernie has done what he's suppose to do, he's attacking Trump, and he's backing Biden.  Likewise, Biden has listened to Bernie and moved left on a couple of issues.  It really isn't unusual at all.  If you want to run the country you are going to need the support of 50% of the country, and that means the support of a bunch of people that don't 100% agree with you.  You do that by compromising on the things you are willing to, and holding to your principles on the things you aren't."
Ask_Politics,"Realistically, yes.  If Biden loses all states polling worse than Pennsylvania right now, but still holds Pennsylvania and the states that he's polling better in, he wins.  If Trump loses the rust belt the only thing that might save him is some kind of massive underperform in the SW for Biden (akin to Hillary's 2016 performance in the rust belt).  If Trump takes Arizona and Nevada, then a win in Colorado or New Mexico would let him win (if he held states like GA,FL, and OH).  Biden is a bit weak on Latino support, but it's not like Trump does wonderful with them either.  Almost any scenario where Trump wins presupposes that he narrows the nationwide lead considerably, because there is no winning with the current map."
Askpolitics,"I think there are three broadly likely outcomes.  All three start with a base assumption that the  currently polling ends up pretty close to the end result, so a moderate or significant Biden win in both EC and popular vote, and the Democrats take over the Senate with 50-51 senators.

Trump Everlasting: Trump attempts to, and succeeds in, keeping his personal coalition of voters together, with or without any kind of approval from the Republican party itself.  It could be that he just doesn't stop running for president, and positions himself for 2024.  So the rally's continue, his twitter feed keeps up, and mostly it's just him complaining about everything, except he's not the president anymore.  Alternatively he could create his own news network/website, where he can gather together a bunch of pro-trump voices and steal a bunch of viewers from fox news/OAN.  This would put him in a position either to run himself, have one of his children run, or to play kingmaker and choose the ""next trump"".

Trumpism without Trump: Trump either decides he doesn't want to directly run again, or (with or without Republican party intervention) loses sole control of his following.  Trumpism itself still survives though, and someone else (Tom Cotton for example) takes up the banner and tries to gather up the Trump voters for themselves.  This probably requires either Trumps personal approval, or for Trump to have died so people can self-declare themselves the next Trump.

No More Trump:  This happens if the Trump coalition either doesn't stay together, or is so toxic to gathering a majority, it's outright rejected.  In the most extreme case, the Party rallies around a Romney-like figure that's the anti-Trump, probably with some sort of narrative that the MSM won't let someone who speaks honestly like Trump become president again, but wink wink we're still on the same side.  More likely, if Trump himself doesn't choose a single candidate, the Trump vote splits across a number of candidates.  Since Trumpism isn't very heavily rooted in specific policy or ideology, there's plenty of room for half a dozen mini-Trumps to run, and no reason for Trump voters to coalesce around a single one of them.  This opens things up for a non-Trump candidate to win, especially if they were pro-Trump for the last 4 years (e.g. Cruz), even if they don't actually act all that much like Trump or follow his beliefs."
Askpolitics,"The most likely event is something close to Obama's approval.  He will likely start his inauguration at somewhere around 60%, as people tend to give the new president the benefit of the doubt for a while.  It will then probably quickly drop to something closer to 50/50 as partisanship sets in.  Likely by the end of his first term he will be below 50%, as most republicans will dislike him for partisan reasons, and dems will be more split depending on if they view him as too moderate or too liberal."
Askpolitics,"Executive orders can't create anything new, all it can do is direct the government to act in a specific way within already existing powers granted by the constitution, or by laws passed by congress.  So many EOs are presented as if they do something big, when they really can't do all that much.  It's much easier to do something like DACA by EO, because that was based on deferring executive action.

So what did Trump actually do.  Well, he directed that insulin be available at federally qualified health centers, which are around 1400 clinics around the US that provide services for low income patients.  He is authorized to do this based on the 340B Drug Pricing Program, a 1992 law, and is basically adding insulin to the list of drugs covered by the program.  This is a good thing.  It won't help the majority of people trying to buy insulin, but it will help a large number of lower income individuals acquire reduced cost insulin.  Unfortunately the EO doesn't detail the timeline or process for when and how this change will go into effect, nor does indicate what the pricing will be for insulin under the plan.  So this change hasn't taken effect, and we don't know if or when it will.

Another major EO was to add insulin to the list of drugs that can be imported to Canada.  That might be a really big deal, except it relies on a new process to import drugs from Canada that doesn't exist yet, so it can't take effect until and if the new import process is finalized and approved.

So these changes might be very helpful someday, but they don't do anything right now, and we don't know if they ever will.  On top of that, even if everything happens in the EOs that's being suggested, there is no evidence that it would make insulin cost ""pennies"" to purchase."
Askpolitics,"In the last 40 years of Libertarian candidates the best they have ever done was 3.28% nationally.  That was last election.  Do you see Democrats or Republicans doing a lot of out reach to libertarian ideas this year?  Are the Libertarians likely to get more support this year, or less?  Does running a joke candidate for the VP slot increase peoples opinions of the party?"
Askpolitics,"The only way you will see a 3rd party grow to actually challenge you would need to either have one of the major parties fall apart, or for their to be a significant realignment of the parties around new stable bases.  You are never going to see a 3rd party go slowly from 2  to 4, to 8, to 16% and then become co-equal with the other 2 parties. 

Further, looking at libertarians as an example.  There is a small, but very present libertarian movement in the US.  It is not, though, something that is now or every likely to be a philosophy on it's own that will have 50%+1 approval.  That's because only big tent ideologies can get that large.  So one could imagine a new or transformed libertarian party that starts from a base of libertarianism, but then needs to significantly expand who gets included in the party.  That wouldn't look much different than simply growing the Libertarian wing of the Republican party, unless there was a huge realignment more on the libertarian/authoritarian axis compared to the mostly liberal/conservative axis of American politics.

So, so wrap up, slowly building more voters for the Libertarian party does nothing to increase the odds of a viable 3rd party.  Better to work within the current two party system to move forward libertarian ideas, which means voting for the Republican or Democrat that is closer to that ideology, not voting 3rd party."
Askpolitics,"This is the main counter argument.  That it can't ever be a permanent solution because the other side can just pack the other direction.  But the democrats may view the current situation as untenable, and willing to trade a short term gain and deal with the consequences.  I mean they are already looking at a court that is much more conservative than the electorate, if the argument is ""well maybe someday the republicans will be able to pack the courts so they look just like the current courts"" that's not really a strong reason not to.

One other reason they may decide to move forward is that a larger supreme court might be more politically healthy than the status quo.  It decreases the power of each individual justice, and therefore the importance of filling the individual seats.  If the US moved to a 15 or 21 sized supreme court, then additionally added a long but firm term limit (e.g. 20 year terms), then we'd be far less likely to end up on the edge of a political crisis whenever a single SC judge dies.  It would also likely increase the ideological diversity of the courts.  We've already seen quite a few court cases where one of the conservative judges votes on non-partisan principles, and sides with the liberal wing, leading to some surprising results.  With a larger number of justice it's more likely you will get different ideological groups that will group together in more complex ways than a simple liberal vs conservative mindset."
Askpolitics,"Almost certainly not.  The debates themselves are usually more political theater than actually impactful.  They are unlikely to actually inform the watcher on much of anything.  In most years, and especially this year, I've made my decision well ahead of the debates anyway.  It would take a real ""When the president does it, that means it is not illegal"" style accidental candor to really change my mind about the candidate."
Askpolitics,"Technically yes, but it would have to be a real rush, it would broadly be seen as simply political overreach, and it wouldn't change anything because there is no way the republicans in the Senate would find him guilty.  As such, there is no reason to pursue it."
Askpolitics,"So if the President committed serious crimes you are left with two very bad alternatives.  Either you engage in what might be considered a political motivated use of the justice department to arrest your political adversaries, or you allow US presidents to get away with committing crimes without being punished for them.  Both of those could potentially set up a very bad precedence for future presidential behavior.  As such, the logical thing to do is to simply do the just thing.  You very openly present the evidence of the case against trump, and you pursue charges against if they rise to the level where you would pursue charges on anyone else."
Askpolitics,"The majority of people aren't particular focused on politics, and aren't doing deep dives  on the candidates tax plans to decide who they are going to vote for.  They are basing their decision on pretty basic emotional responses to the candidates.  Trump isn't well liked, and Biden is boring, and they prefer boring to unlikeable.  So all Biden really needs to do to win is sit back and wait and hope nothing crazy happens.

People who are involved in politics probably decided who they were voting for months ago and possibly quite a long while before that.  They don't really need to listen to one more Biden media appearance to make a decision, and don't really care if he is spending a ton of time doing press or not.  So it doesn't really hurt him with that group."
Askpolitics,Almost certainly.  If trump wins a fair election he’s president and that’s just the way it is.  And while people worry about trump shenanigans with regards to the election the actual mechanisms of the election are extremely distributed and not much under federal control.  So except in the very small chance that trump actually steals an election I wouldn’t support any kind of non-democratic violent action to overturn an election.
Askpolitics,That is a presidential directive.  It does nothing but instruct the federal government on how it may use powers that are already constitutionally or legislatively granted to the executive branch.  It's completely powerless against the 20th Amendment which states that his current term ends at noon on Jan 20th 2021.
Askpolitics,"Biden has a pretty firm and comfortable lead at the moment.  He also has an opposing candidate that is constantly in the press, but usually in ways that aren't helpful to him.  His overriding goal right now should be not to make any mistakes.  So, there is very little to gain electorally by him releasing a list of candidates, and potential that it could become a story for somer reason, so the correct political thing is to simply ignore the request from Trump."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's not racist, per se, but it's still overgeneralizing via a stereotype that may or may not be true.  While there are genetic traits that correlate well with geographic locations, they don't map well to the uselessly broad races we tend to use (White/Black/Asian).  For example ""white"" people have highly variable degree of lactose tolerance, with those in north western Europe having very high levels of acceptance, and souther and eastern europeans being much lower.  Sub-saharan africans are quite mixed, with some areas having pretty high tolerance and others very low.  People from Eastern China, Korea, and Japan have very low levels of lactose tolerance, but it's higher in SE Asia, Eastern Russia, and especially India."
NoStupidQuestions,"If a single large company is failing, we usually just let it die.  This is particularly true when it's a ""natural"" death.  This tends to happen slowly as the company get outcompeted, or the product they produce is no longer highly valuable.  Whatever niche they were offering has, at that point, already been replaced by other companies or other products, and along with it, the workforce has dwindled down to a small enough number that the loss of the jobs doesn't create secondary shockwaves.

Bailouts usually occur when entire industries are in trouble.  This usually happens when some sort of short term external shock hits an industry (think 9/11 for airlines, or a whole bunch of industries with covid).  These companies may be in real short term peril, but there isn't really a reason to suspect that someone new competitor would do a better job in the same situation.  Further, allowing them to collapse in the short term would ripple through the economy, which would cause other companies to potentially collapse.  We also tend to believe that a short term loan will allow these companies to  make it through the shock and recover after the shock is over, because the fundamentals of their industry are still sound.  Once covid passes we will still have a need for restaurants and airplanes, we don't want to destroy those industries and force the economy to rebuild all that work from scratch."
Askpolitics,"I don't think most of the people who are arguing over this have actually looked into it all that much.  Also given the partisanship of the US right now, things just become instantly ""us vs them"" nowadays.  Look at the Kyle Rittenhouse situation for example.  You've got knee jerk reactions, within hours of the event, that he's either a white supremacist out hunting to kill black folk, or he's a patriot who is defending himself from a mob of antifa terrorists."
Askpolitics,"This is really just an old conspiracy theory that gets reborn slightly differently each generation.  Somewhere around the mid 19th century we start to see various anti-secret society conspiracies that groups like the Freemasons or the Bavarian Illuminati were part of a global effort at world domination.  These started to merge with anti-Semitic conspiracy  theories in the 20th century with things like Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and conspiracies around the Rothchilds.  Modern takes on this come in the form of Jewish conspiracies, fear of ""globalism"" via things like the UN and WTO, and most recently QAnon style ""global elites"" conspiracies."
Askpolitics,"Nazi racial theory was centered around the concept that the pure ayran bloodline was the next evolution of humans.  They thought it spread out from the nordic areas all over Europe and Asia (I'm not sure what their thoughts on pre-Columbian North America were), and with that came superior culture, but it was always limited because the Aryans interbred with the locals.  They viewed this race mixing as destructive to the bloodline, and thought it might destroy this potential next evolution, and so they were looking to eliminate or subjugate the nearby lesser races so they had the space to breed this superhuman society without interbreeding."
Askpolitics,"To be clear, pretty much no one is defending the sexualization of children.  The question is  should you support a movie like Cuties.  Cuties, was an attempt to criticize sexualization of children in things like child dance competitions and beauty pageants.  It does so with over the top and blatantly offensive portrayals.  So the question is not ""does it sexualize children"", yes it does, the question is does it tell us something important about how children are sexualized, or is it simply prurient material.  Secondly, could the message attempting to be conveyed had been accomplished without putting actual children in such overt sexualized situations?

As a rule, the left is usually more supportive of free speech, especially controversial artistic expression, so you will probably find more defenders on the left.  In general, though, it seems like both sides agree this was done in poor taste (especially after the netflix marketing), and would prefer it not be on Netflix.

For reference though, Dance Moms (just one of many child reality shows) had an episode where the kids did a burlesque show where they were made to look topless...and still had 6 more season after that."
rpg,"Champions (4th edition), and it had a huge effect on how I play RPGs.  I already liked superhero comics, so the theme was good to start, but it was the system that blew my mind at the time.  The freedom to not have classes, and to have generic powers that you could modify do do exactly what you want.  It was amazing to me.  But it also taught me that you can separate the crunch from the fluff, which is what I do commonly in all systems now.  So when I'm playing D&D I'll think of the spell I'd like to have, find the closest mechanical example I can, and just redo the fluff on it, with as little tweaking as I can get away from."
Askpolitics,"The entire point of cutting social security would be because we decided we can not afford to give out anymore.  There is no inherent reason for social security to run out though.  Social security is currently payed for via payroll taxes.  It ran at a surplus for decades, basically while all the baby boomers were in the prime earning days, for the express purpose of taking care of all the baby boomers once they hit social security age.  So there is a temporary problem of a bunch of baby boomers hitting social security at the same time, but that was mostly solved by increased payroll tax.  There is also the long term problem that people are living much longer, meaning social security is costing us more than than prior.  To deal with that we can do a couple of things.  First we could simply increase the payroll tax, either by increasing the tax rate, or by increasing or removing the social security tax cap (currently if you make more than around 140k you stop paying social security tax on your higher income).  Alternatively we could simply supplement social security in the budget, this could be paid for via any additional kind of taxation, or simply deficit funded like we do for other parts of the budget.  Thirdly we could decrease the cost of social security, by things like increasing the age before it kicks it, or decreasing it's payouts.  In the case of the third option though, there is no reason to think that those that get less out of social security would get something else to replace it.  If you can spend money replacing social security you could simply spend that on keeping social security running."
Askpolitics,"Kentucky already has the Bourbon Trial which is an attempt to create tourism around it's bourbon industry.  It isn't as popular as Napa but that probably has little to do with dry counties.  Napa works well because the wineries are literally down he street for each other.  You can see dozens of them, both big and small in a row.  They have a wine train and bus tours so you so you can drink for as long as you want without having to drive, and then they have hotels and dining so you can spend the night there.  Basically, there is an entire industry built up around the Napa experience.  It's also nearby a number of other tourist locations, making it good for a single day experience in a larger vacation.

The bourbon trail isn't like that.  There are a relatively small number of distilleries spread out over a large area of western Kentucky, but they are in wet counties for the most part.  You can do bourbon tastings a them, but you need to drive pretty long distances between the various distilleries to do so.  It's often better to just go to one of distilleries that has a number of brands you enjoy.  It's just not the same kind of experience as Napa though.  You also would need to either be in the general area for something else (and there are a lot of tourist attractions in the area) or go to Kentucky specifically for the tasting."
NoStupidQuestions,"Taxes are not particularly hard for many people.  Taxes get complex with you have multiple forms of income, when you have investment income, or you own a business.  Itemized deductions used to cause some complexity, but with the higher standard deduction since the 2017 tax bill it's less common to itemized.  For people with simple income streams you add up your total income, minus the standard deduction, and lookup your taxes owed.  You compare that to the taxes that were withheld from your paychecks and see if you owe money or are owed money."
rpg,"Phoenix Command.  It's an RPG that focused on modern firearms combat with an attempt to make the most realistic firearms simulation possible.  This is an epically overly complicated combat system, and I say this as someone who actually enjoyed Rolemaster.  The basic system was crazy enough by itself, but the truly awe-inspiring part was the advanced combat system.  In that system you would roll for hit location on a chart with 40 or so very specific hit locations.  You then take your bullet penetration value, based on your weapon and distance to target.  Then you get to trace the bullets path through the body to determine the damage.  You literally look at the location of the hit, and see that at 2.8 inches of penetration you have broken through the rib to enter the left lung.  The damage model, went from 1 point of damage to 10 million points of damage (this was getting hit in the face point blank with a tank round).  But anything above about 1000 would kill you, making most of that complexity pretty useless.  The only difference was how fast you died, or what level of hospital you needed to get to to save your life.

I never got a chance to actually play a campaign in the system, we didn't get beyond basic combat examples.  It was fun in a goofy way, but I can't image actually trying to play a game of it unless you just really love the absurd specificity of the game."
Askpolitics,"So the odds that Trump decides to barricade himself in the Whitehouse and refuse to physically leave after losing are slim, so the scenarios where the government has to drag him out of the building, and/or refuse to remove him aren't very realistic.

A more realistic scenario is something like this.  On election night Trump declares himself the winner, based on how well he's doing on in person voting on the day of the election.  After all the mail in votes are counted he loses by a moderate amount.  Trump declares those votes fraudulent and starts talking about not excepting them.  At this point though, the actual decision making is being done by a bunch of state election officials and state attorney generals.  Most of them probably aren't going to want to say that the way they ran their elections was fraudulent, and they would need something a lot larger than bluster and innuendo to hold up a presidential election.  Likewise members of congress (most of which just go reelected based off these election results) probably don't want to start a epic shitstorm by suggesting their own elections are fraudulent.  At this point the republican party (with some exceptions like Jordan or Gaetz) tries to get Trump to backdown on his claims and suggest the process is valid.

After states start to certify the results, if True persists he can start legal challenges to the election.  Due to the Gore vs Bush supreme court case though, Trump has a limited amount of time (about a month) to try to make some legal claim as to why the election results should be thrown out.  This isn't likely to go anywhere without very strong evidence of widespread fraud.  So the electoral college will make their final decision on the president, and at that point Trump has no legal avenue to remain president.  While you might see some Republicans going ""I disagree with it, but the courts have decided and we have to accept that"", most are just going to want Trump out of the way at that point, and likely they start talking about where all the bodies are buried and how it might be better for Trump to quietly go away."

I’m not sure exactly what the justification is for removing the sorting machines unless they plan to shut down some sorting locations."

So instead of being 1 really close election for a large number of ECs, you split it up to a bunch of smaller elections, many of which aren't very competitive.

Unfortunately narrow hips and big skulls make birthing more difficult.  We could get rid of the narrow hips, or the big brains, but they are both really good, so instead we compromise.  Human babies are born earlier in development that many other species, so their skulls are smaller at that point.  The skull also hasn't fused yet, which lets the babies skull crumple up a bit as it goes through the birth canal.  This leads to painful and difficult child birth, even the death of mother or child at times, but biologically that trade off is apparently worth the cost, given that it lets us walk upright with big brains."

explainlikeimfive,"Imagine we are back in the time before the printing press, when manuscripts had to be hand copied by scribes.  Multiple scribes will make a new copy from the same older manuscript, but eventually that manuscript will physically decay and no longer be readable, or will fall apart.  Now lets say you gather up all the manuscripts that exist and you notice that there are differences in the manuscripts.  At some point one of the scribes might have misspelled someones name in the document.  All the people that copied this mistake, and all the people that copies from those copies, preserve this mistake, so it shows up in a bunch of the documents you have now.  But if it's a simple mistake, and one that would be easy to make, you can't be sure that all these documents came from the same lineage, because it's possible that two different scribes simply made the same mistake.  The more generation you have the higher the likely that a mistake can happen more than once.  These kind of single letter mistakes are akin to point mutations in biology.

Now, all is not lost, because if the document is large and the number of copies is large (both true for something like DNA for the animal kingdom), then you won't be looking at just one mistake.  You can see lots of differences between the documents, and you will start to notice things like every single copy that hast mistake A also has mistake B, but not every copy with mistake B has mistake A.  That is strong evidence that mistake B happened prior to mistake A, and mistake A happened only in the branch that included mistake B (it could still have happened more than once within the family that includes mistake B though).  With this kind work we can build a nested hierarchy.  In biology we did this first via morphology (mammals are animals that all have mammary glands, 3 bones in the ear, and a 4 chambered heart).  Later, with DNA testing we updated our hierarchies with all the genetic evidence for a nested hierarchy.

Now, imagine that at some point there is a scribe, and he thinks there is a problem with the document.  He thinks that something is missing, or that the information is incorrect.  So what he does is adds a whole bunch of new information.  A whole new paragraph of his own design.  Now everyone that copies his document doesn't know it's a new paragraph, they just copy it down like they are suppose to.  Now if we found this full paragraph in one of our final documents that would be very strong evidence that it was related to all the other documents that included that paragraph.  What are the odds that two different scribes had decided to invent the exact same paragraph and add it to the document at the exact same location?  That's what an ERV is.  It's a big block of unique DNA.  It's too big to be a point mutation.  It's not a long repeating string like some forms of copy mutations.  We know it's a viral remnant and not a useful bit of code created do to convergent evolution (when evolution finds the same answer to a problem more than once, such as flight or eyesight).  So we can be highly confident that this is marker that only appeared one time ever, and therefore is a good indicator of shared decent."

If he takes the senate as well he either needs bipartisan support (which seems unlikely without a lot of compromises), or he needs to pass it via reconciliation.  You only really get 1 reconciliation bill per year and gun control probably ranks below other Biden priorities (Voting Rights, ACA Expansion, Tax Bill).  He can push to remove the filibuster, but even if he does that there is only so much political capital to get work done, and gun control may fit in the schedule.  The good thing is some parts of gun control have very popular support, making it easier to pass, and might be an ""easy win"" for the Dems to pass with little cost, but it probably still requires either the filibuster removed, or tacking it onto another piece of legislature."

explainlikeimfive,The price you see for a stock is literally just the last price it sold for.
explainlikeimfive,"Each stock sale is actually between two people, the buyer and the seller.  The market is just the ""meeting place"" for these people to buy and sell.  Each one of the active buyers lists what price they want to buy at, and each one of the sellers lists the price they want to sell out.  These are called limit orders, because they say ""I want to buy/sell, but only at this price"".  They create a large backlog of potential buyers and sellers, but you only really care about the buyer who's willing to pay the most (called the bid), and the seller who's willing to accept the least (called the ask), for a stock.  Since there is no reason to buy a stock from a specific person, and because all the prices are open to everyone, you'll always want to buy or sell at those prices.  There will also always be a little gap between the bid and the ask, because if the stocks were the cross (the bid going below the ask) then the person with the bid and the person with the ask would transact with each other.  The people very near the bid/ask point are more likely to get a transaction fast, but the ones further away are more likely to get a better deal, but only if the stock hits that point.

Most of the time people will do what's called a market buy/sell, that means ""do the transaction at whatever the current price is"".  So if you do a market buy you will purchase the stock at the current ask price.  Now imagine a whole bunch of people decided to buy at near the same time.  Each time time someone does a buy the buy at the current ask price, but that ask price keeps going up, because other people had their limit sell at a higher price (or they would be the ask).  This means the gap between the bid and ask is going to increase, and new limit orders will take it's place.  Which ones fill this gap is due to supply and demand.  Because the price is changing dynamically people are constantly readjusting their expectations on what a good price for the stock is, and new buyers and sellers enter the market."

High upload speeds are useful for people who server content, these are usually businesses selling (or advertising upon) that content.  High download speed are useful for consumers of said content.  Consumers are more price conscious than businesses, so providers want to charge them less than businesses.  One way to do that is to provide a cheap product with high download and low upload speeds.  That is well suited to the consumer needs without allowing businesses to ""freeload"" by making the product ill-suited to their needs.

This is the same dynamic that makes plane trips across a saturday night cheaper.  Business travelers tend to travel during the work week, and usually want to be back home by Friday, while vacation travelers want to travel across a weekend to save vacation days.  This allows airlines to charge more for business travel."

NoStupidQuestions,"Bruce Willis, and it isn't very close.

Val Kilmer biggest roles were in supporting roles, not the lead: Top Gun, Tombstone, Heat.  Many of the big budget movies where he was in the lead did only moderately well: Willow, The Ghost and the Darkness, The Saint.  His biggest mainstream hit was Batman Forever, but there isn't taking over an existing series with a built in audience.

Die Hard, by itself, would put Willis over Kilmer, but he's also a lead in 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element and The Sixth Sense, as well as a major supporting character in Pulp Fiction and Armageddon."
NoStupidQuestions,"So hanging as a form of capital punishment has been around for quite awhile, so people over time have learned the proper way to hang someone.  If done correctly the goal isn't to asphyxiate the person being executed, it's to break their neck.  To do that you just need a longer length of rope and more room to have them drop.  The exact distance is based on their weight.  But, if you drop too far you can, in fact, tear the head off.  So executioners learned the right length per weight you needed kill someone rapidly without asphyxiation or the head popping off.

Now that's for your hangman style killing from a gallows.  People that kill themselves by hanging usually fall from a very short distance and will die by asphyxiation."
explainlikeimfive,"In the US, because the Fed has an inflation target of 2% and it uses the tools at it's disposal to try to keep a small amount of inflation.  They do this because deflation (the opposite of inflation) is very bad for the economy, so they'd rather err on the side of inflation than deflation.  There are also some benefits to a small amount of inflation (it encourage investment, and it's a workaround to sticky wages)."
Askpolitics,"There is probably no way to make that work well.  First if you mean keep the current EC with individual voters and the current number of electors per state you won't be able to distribute those to the counties well.  Many states will have more counties than electors, so you either need to split electors or merge counties votes for a single elector.  

If you meant treat counties like we currently treat states, where each county gets 2 ""senator"" electors plus a number of electors based on population you are going to run into the problem that the number of counties per state varies widely.  Texas has 254 counties in it, some with extremely small amounts of population, while California only has 58.  This would just increase the problem of urban districts getting more votes than urban districts.

If you want to remove the notion of an actual human elector and instead treat it as a weighted vote share where each county could get some sort of ""elector equivalents"" worth of voting power then you are moving closer to making a state proportional system.  This kind of works, but if you wanted to go this way you could just do proportional allotment at the state level easier.

The problem will always be that counties sizes and population differ so much from state to state it makes for a bad unit to vote at, and whatever problem you are trying to solve via counties is probably easier done via a different mechanism."
explainlikeimfive,"School also work as a form of child care, relieving the need for one of the parents to stay home to watch the children.  If schools and day care aren't open then a relatively large amount of people simply can't return to a job that can't be done remotely.  This isn't the only thing hurting the economy right now, obviously, but it does have a significant impact.  If you could safely reopen schools without causing an outbreak amongst the children or school employees then there would be a strong reason to reopen schools on economic grounds.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be a way to safely reopen schools at this time."
Askpolitics,"""Bend the curve"" was the initial goal.  The entire point of bending the curve is to minimize the damage and buy time.  You should use that time to work on bulking up your supplies, study the disease, increase your testing, work on your treatments, and work on potential cures.  

Once we understood what we were dealing with, the goal was to try to slow down the spread enough that we could put a track and trace program in place.  You can't track and trace if the virus is running wild, it's just too hard to track in that state.  If we look at how much of the rest of the world handled covid, obviously that was possible.  Even New York handled the virus well after it's initial stumbling.  That was the goal.  But many other states didn't learn from watching New York or the EU.  We politicized common sense defenses to the disease, and we pretended like it just wasn't a big deal.  In other parts of the world they are already getting back to a state of semi-normalcy.  A low infection low death state that they can easily sustain until a vaccine or effective treatment comes alone.

The US is not like that at all.  We're back starting on our bigger second wave now.  So our goal should be to start by bending the curve again (but we are behind to even try that in some places).  We need to try to squash the growth rate again, which means moving back to phase 1 in most places which includes an outright ban on many indoor activities that seem to be the main cause of spreading the disease.  We need to push mask usage and social distancing.  Once the second wave peaks we need to monitor it to see if we can get it down to a track and trace level or not.  New York could be on the leading edge there, since they aren't seeing a second wave.

The end goal, though, is in fact to minimize death while we wait for a cure.  The goal was never to just wait until every on earth gets covid-19, the death rates on that, even if we don't overwhelm the hospitals, would be enormous.  Luckily for us it seems like we have been getting pretty lucky on the vaccine front so far.  We have multiple potential vaccines that are in Phase III testing already, with some hope that we might have a viable vaccine before end of year (this is still way different than that vaccine being widely available, or that we get back to normal at that point)."
PoliticalDiscussion,"So it's slightly odd that Arizona and North Carolina have been both looking pretty ok for months, but they haven't risen with Biden's rising national numbers.  As we currently sit both them are well behind Wisconsin and Florida to be the potential tipping point state.  Arizona is probably slightly better odds than NC, but it's not currently looking like it will be a deciding factor in the election."

Askpolitics,"Reddit users tend to be from a demographic that heavily supported Bernie Sanders.  While Sanders and Biden were rivals for the Democratic nomination, that meant mostly anti-Biden comments.  Now that Biden is the candidate, it's it's Biden versus Trump, many of those people are now pro-Biden.  Some of this might be a legit change of heart about their views on Biden, but most of it is simply politics.  Your enemies in one context are your allies in another context."
Askpolitics,"Yes.  There are very few limits to the pardon power, but they only extended to federal courts.  The president can't pardon someone from a state level charge, only the governor of that state can.

We seen plenty of self-serving pardons.  For example Bill Clinton pardoned his brother for no reason other than it was his brother, and George W Bush pardoned (technically he commuted the sentence) Scooter Libby (his VP's chief of staff) which prevented Libby from potentially testifying against Cheney or Bush about the Valerie Plame outing.

The only real check against pardons and many other presidential abuses of power is impeachment.  But this is why controversial pardons tend to happen in a lame duck session for the president.  If he doesn't do it earlier it's pretty likely that Trump will pardon all of his friends that are in legal trouble as soon as the election is over."
Askpolitics,"There is a wide gulf between ""what happens naturally"" and ""what is moral"".  If I go to the top of a building and push an anvil over the side of the building, what is going to happen?  The theory of gravity tells us that the anvil with fall until it reaches the ground.  It doesn't matter if there is a person below the anvil that will be killed or not, the anvil will fall.  That isn't the same as saying that pushing anvils off the top of buildings is a moral act.

Likewise the law of evolution says that the fittest is most likely to survive.  While ""fitness"" isn't well understood by most people, even if you use it correctly just because something is fit doesn't mean it's moral to force fit things to survive and unfit things to die."
Askpolitics,"Probably depends on where you are getting your estimates.  The first links I could find put Bernies M4A plan at $32.6T/10 years ([Mercatus](https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/commentary/medicare-all-plan-would-cost-federal-government-32-trillion)), and Warrens plan would cost $32.0T/10 years ([Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/incremental-comprehensive-health-reform-how-various-reform-options-compare-coverage-and-costs)).  It's unlikely that the same study would find radically different costs to Warren and Sanders M4A plans."
Askpolitics,"Trump was unsuccessful because his process is haphazard leading to legal challenges.  Roberts has shot him down more than once on cases not because Trump lacks the statutory authority to do what he's doing, but that he doesn't go through the correct legal procedures to execute that authority.  If Trump wanted to take the political hit, and actually did things correctly, he could have removed DACA long ago.  Trumps original plan seemed to be to hostage take DACA and extract some concessions, not to actually remove it."
Askpolitics,"Yes, for the most part.  EO's are, by their nature, very limited in what they can do.  You can't create new law with an EO, all you can do is describe how you will enact existing law.  Now that isn't nothing, you could, for example, decriminalize marijuana at a federal level with the stroke of a pen by removing enforcement efforts, or you could reschedule it which would have a trickle down effect into other law enforcement.  But nothing you can do will prevent the next president from doing the opposite (except to the degree that anything that occurred during your presidency is already done).  

Now Biden couldn't literally write ""I declare everything Trump did undone"", but he could already have prepared a set of EO's for literally the first day of his presidency to undo whatever he didn't like of the EO's that Trump did."
Askpolitics,"Trump did fairly well with white voters, but particular well with whites with less than a college degree.  According to exit polling for the 2016 election he won white’s without a college degree 67-28, and white’s with college degrees 49-45.  He has mostly retained that dominance with white’s without a college degree, but as was apparent in the 2018 elections, he’s become quite toxic to whites with a college degree.  The latest Marist poll has him 60-33 against Biden with whites without a college education, but he’s losing whites with a college degree 59-39%.  It’s exceedingly doubtful that Trump can win with anything near that level of support."
Askpolitics,I'm mostly just paraphrasing Nate here anyway.
Askpolitics,"Yes, Probably.  First off we are still months away from the election, so we don't know where we will end up, but if we are only talking about the current state of the election, it looks like Biden is doing much better in these states than Hillary.

RCP currently has Biden as Pennsylvania as Biden +5.6, Wisconsin at +5.4, and Michigan as +8.  538 has similar numbers of Pennsylvania +5.3, Wisconsin +6.6, and Michigan +9.2.  So if these numbers are correct then Biden is doing way better than Clinton was in 2016.

But didn't the polls say Hillary would win the rustbelt?  Yes, kind of.  Polls don't make predictions for the future (models are what do that), but the polling in the rustbelt was quite good for Hillary.  538's final polling averages were Wisconsin as Clinton +5.3%, Pennsylvania +3.7, and Michigan +4.2%.  So why did polling miss by that far, and all in the same direction?  To answer that you need to understand a bit more of how polls actually work.  

There is a problem with polling called ""non response bias"".  What this means is that some groups will answer a poll more frequently than others.  So even if you randomly select people to be in the poll you are going to undercount groups that don't like to answer polls as much (generally older people answer polls more than younger people for example).  So polls are weighted, so you give higher value to the answers of groups that are under representatives.  If this is done well it will give you something much closer to the true answer.  There is nothing new about this, it's something pollsters have done for a very long time.  But what happened in 2016 was that White voter without a college degree went very heavily to Trump, and White voters with a college degree went for Clinton.  The polls were waiting for things like race and age, but they weren't weighting for education.  Whites without college degrees weren't answering polls as much as Whites with college degrees, which caused an uncaught non response bias.  This caused those voters to be under represented, and lead to a greater than average polling error.

So, why should we trust polls in 2020.  First, some pollsters are now weighting by education, specifically not to make the same mistake.  Second, Biden' national polling is much stronger than Clintons.  This matters because it gives us better evidence that the state level polling is correct.  It's hard to imagine a scenario where Biden wins the popular vote by 9% but loses the electoral college.  We have a lot of history showing the general left/right lean of states, and states have a tendency (not always, but a tendency) to shift in relation to the national polling.  Next, Clinton and Trumps head to head polling was highly erratic, swinging from Clinton +10 to Trump +1, then back to Clinton +5 all in a couple of months.  2020 polling has been much more consistent.  2020 also has way less swing voters (more people are heavily committed to a candidate at this point) than 2016.  That means less room for voters to swing to the other direction."
Askpolitics,"BLM is all about the fact that black deaths, by police and by society, go unnoticed and not dealt with.  The fact that you have to say the words ""Black Lives Matter"" is, by it's nature, absurd.  The fact you need a national-wide protest just to get justice, is also absurd.  Given that the context is ""African-Americans deserve, at the very least, to not live in fear of being killed on film and their killers going free"", what is the charitable meaning of the phrase ""All Lives Matter"" as a counter to  ""Black Lives Matter""?"
Askpolitics,"Yes, but it's useless to remove the context.  You could also say you were ""looking for a final solution to the african-american problem"" and if you were completely ignorant of the term ""final solution"" that might sound that an acceptable phrase, but it would be an absurdly white supremacist to say such a thing.  Maybe some of the people saying ""all lives matter"" are just ignorant of what they are trying to say, but most at least mean ""there isn't a specific problem with violence against blacks and they don't deserve special recognition in society"", which is exactly the problem that BLM is trying to point out."
Askpolitics,"Good to know.  I was basing my statement on the (obviously non-medical) opinions of his son Ron, who thought he was already showing signs."
Askpolitics,"I haven't seen specific polling on the situation, but it doesn't seem like it would be that high.  In the latest YouGov [poll](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/zjnvz78244/tabs_Trump_Tweets_20200609.pdf), which has Trump at a net approval of -10, he still has Republican support of 86%, with 59% of it being strong approval.  While some of this is undoubtably just partisan flag waving, Trump's approval problems haven't been with his base, it's him getting abandoned by the moderates."
Askpolitics,"FDR famously had polio, and was spent much of his time in a wheel chair, but that fact was hidden from the public, with that tacit approval of the press not to photograph him when in the wheel chair.

Reagan, as well, appears to have been suffering from early symptoms of Alzheimer's during his second term, although I'm not aware of any evidence that he or others had a medical diagnoses of Alzheimers at the time."
Askpolitics,"Two major things are going one.  One is the increase in partisanship in the country.  I generally trace it back to the 1994 Republican Revolution.  It was the first time the Republicans took the house in 40 years, and it was mostly on the strength of anti-Clinton rhetoric.  Each new president since then things get to be more and more partisan.  There is less ability to find bipartisan agreement on legislature, there is less split party voting, and there has been a nationalization of all political races (it used to be more common to vote different locally and at the state level than at the national level).  We've reached a point where the only thing that really matters is the little letter after a candidates name.  This creates a 30% or so population on each side that is die hard for their side, and only the 40% in the middle sways back and forth.

On top of this, Trump is highly divisive candidate.  His fanbase likes his aggressive and direct style, but he's usually aiming at the people on the other side of the party line.  This has created it's own tit for tat escalation of twitter name calling and general incivility.  So even more than prior presidents Trump has polarized opinions about himself to a greater degree than we've seen any other time modern american history."
Askpolitics,"Polls aren't predictions.  Polls don't tell you what is going to happen in the future, they tell you the state of the world (within a tolerance) at that time.  Models, on the other hand, try to take polling, and potential other factors (state of the economy, incumbency, etc), and try to make a prediction of the likely outcome.  Some models in 2016 were fine and others were horrible.

So what actually happened in 2016?  First thing, the national polling was pretty good.  Most polling down near the end was around the 3-4% for Hillary, and the final was 2.1%, that's within the margin of error on polling, so it's not a surprising result given the polling.  The actual polling errors were in the rust belt, where they were just way off in their state wide polling.  I haven't seen an actual analysis of what caused this error, but it was likely a combination of bad likely voter screens (how polls try to figure out who's going to vote in a given year), the timid trump effect (trump did better in automated polls than in person polls, suggesting people supported trump but were shy about saying so in polls), and the general trend that people broke late for Trump and he won a large amount of the undecided.

Most of the problem, though, came from the pundits and people.  People simply should have been way less confident that Hillary was going to win given the information they had, but they weren't.  When a good model tells you there is a 30% chance of Trump winning, you should treat that literally that it's near 1 in 3 chance of the underdog winning.  But people look at 70% Hillary and treat it like 99% Hillary.  They massively overvalued the position of the current leader.  They also concentrated on the fact that earlier in the race Hillary was a bigger leader than she was down the stretch.  Part of this was also a whole bunch of bias from the pundits that just didn't think it was possible that Trump could win, and they let that bias warp their understanding and therefore their analysis.

On top of this, because of the success of Nate Silver's 538 in 2008 and 2012 presidential election predictions (he missed Indiana in '08 and correctly predicted every other state), there was a rush for everyone to build their own models to make their own predictions.  Many of these models were just bad shallow copies of 538's model (i.e. the copied the poll aggregation).  If you want a good predictive model based on polling you have to understand how polls work, and how they aren't perfect predictors of the future.  You have to account for likely polling errors, and understand the ways in which they might fail.  If all you do is look state's polling and pretend like you are 100% confident that the leader will win, you end up with those ""95% chance of winning"" models that are so bad.

So what should we do with polls in 2020.  First, we are still a long way out from the actual election, and polls change over time because peoples opinions change over time.  Historically head to head polling this far away from an election are off by about 6%, which is a massive difference in a presidential election.  Add in the fact that we are still in the middle of global pandemic and economic meltdown, and it's really hard to say what's going to happen in November given the state of things now.  Given the polling you should be highly confident that Biden is currently winning, but you shouldn't have high confidence that Biden (or Trump) is going to win.  Polls, for all their faults, are still are best method of gathering information about the state of the election.  If you ignore polling then you are back to getting your information for gut reactions from pundits mixed with ""conventional wisdom"" which is way worse."
Askpolitics,"I agree, I think it's a pretty bad slogan, especially for people that don't mean anything like a literal usage of the word defund.  It's also opens people up to political attacks based on a plain understanding of the word defund.  It's something that's easier to say or put on a sign to show everyone is on the same side, even if they radically disagree with what change they want to see."
Askpolitics,"The people supporting ""Defund"" mean a lot of different things, making it not a particular useful phrase (except being simple and evocative).  I'm just going to list some of the various things people in this very broad camp are suggesting, many of them being mutually exclusive.

Defund the police, so they collapse - Some people literally think the current police system is worse than having no police, that police are a net societal ill, and just letting the whole system come crashing down, and then reconsider what to replace it with

Defund the police, to demilitarize them - This group thinks that a major issue is the militarization of the police, and therefore prevent them from purchasing military style equipment via funding choices would significantly help the situation.

Defund the police, to change what policing means - These people want a fundamentally different definition of police and policing.  This is about changing the duties of a police force, and how they interact with those they protect.  They may or may not be suggesting that the replacement would cost less, only that it wouldn't be paying for the current style of policing

Defund the police, replace with private security - The capitalist/libertarian solution that private police forces would be more efficient and less corrupt than state run police systems.

""Defund"" the police, but I didn't really mean defund - Plenty of people are using this as a catch phrase but they don't seem to really mean anything close to actually decreasing funding levels.   Replace ""Defund"" with ""Change"" or ""Fix"" and that's closer to what they believe."
Askpolitics,"Traditionally the demographics that vote the most frequently for Republicans also have a higher likelihood of voting.  This leads to the belief that higher turnout is usually better for Democrats because Republican voters ""always vote"" and therefore higher turnout means the less likely Democrat voters also turned out.  Now this is hard to prove empirically via election results, because elections are so infrequent.  To get a large enough sample of elections you have to wait a long period of time, and by then whatever you might have been measuring might be different (does it matter if Republicans did better or worse in high turnout elections 40 years ago?).  Additionally there is so many other things that drive elections that it would be hard to isolate just turnout and determine it was the cause.

What we can do as a proxy though, is look at polling data.  We poll way more frequently than we have an election, so we have lots of lots of data on that.  What we commonly find is democratic candidate do the best on ""all americans"" polls, moderately worse on ""registered voter"" polls, and even slightly more worse on ""likely voter"" polls.  This seems to suggest that, in fact, republican voters are more likely to vote."
Askpolitics,"Trumps electoral path to victory is the same as it has been since January, basically a replay of 2016, but probably less of an EC victory.  He can afford to lose the popular vote by around 2-3% as long as he holds on to the rust belt.  He's probably most looking for taking Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Michigan.  He could also lose Michigan but take Arizona as long as he also takes the two purple congressional district electors (ME-2 and NE-2).

The things that would help trump significantly at this point:

1) A bad VP choice - VP choices rarely make a huge difference in the presidential elections, but is widely thought that this year Biden's choice is a big deal.  He's got a diverse set of groups in his coalition that may want conflicting things out of their preferred VP choice.  He may want to go with someone from the rust belt, to try to secure those critical battleground states, he'd also like a candidate that the liberal wing of the party can accept, and he wants to push African-American support closer to Obama's numbers than Clinton's (and because they saved his campaign in SC).  But if he picks someone that only makes 1 of the 3 happy, or worse picks someone that ""checks some boxes"" but makes none of them happy, then it could end up alienating part of his base.

2) Economy - Trumps core strength is his economic arguments, it's one of the few things where he has a significant lead over Biden.  One of two things could help him here.  A legitimate V-shaped recovery (v-shaped = a sharp decline followed by a sharp return to normal), where he could make the argument that he saved the economy, or brought us out of recession.  Especially good if it's very clear that we are moving in the right direction, but we aren't out of the recession yet, so concern about backsliding remains.  Less good, but a possibility, is if covid mostly stays in the background, and the BLM protests have died down in a couple of months, and all that's left is current economic concerns.  Even if the economy is still in a bad state Trump can rely on it being so obviously an external effect, and continue to promise all the things he's going to do to make things better.

3) Biden loses the moderate - Biden really needs to win back some Obama->Trump voters.  He's not going to win the guys with the MAGA hats, but that's not who he's looking for.  He wants to win over some people in the middle that were willing to give Trump a chance, but they aren't huge fans of his, and probably don't like the way things have been going.  Biden is pretty well situated to take those voters, but if he's forced to move too far from a moderate position to keep some element of his base happy, he might start to lose these voters.

4) Biden gaffes - Gaffes tend to get way over concentrated on, as they very rarely change anyone's opinion.  It's almost certain that Biden will say something stupid that will upset people, but the same way that Trump will say something insulting on twitter, it's already baked in.  People already expect this kind of behavior and have already decided they can support the candidate through whatever comes in that regard.  But every once in awhile you get a Dean Scream or a Dukakis in the Tank moment, that for some reason gets a ton of media attention and people actually care about it.

5) Wildcard - It's 2020, who knows what's going to happen.  There's always a chance of something really weird happening.  There could be a big resurgence of covid, or more protests, that disrupt the voting process.  Either Trump or Biden could end up getting sick.  There could be a major scandal.  None of that is likely, but it's always a possibility."
Askpolitics,"Ask yourself who you think would do a better job at handling covid, at police violence, and handling Russia/China/Iran?  You don't have to like a candidate, or agree with the platform fully, you just have to decide who would be a better leader for this country right now."
Askpolitics,"This is literally [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes).  The Russian government has used racial violence in the US in their propaganda for over 100 years to distract from their own human rights violation.  The Russian public position shouldn't impact us in the slightest, we should do the right thing because it's the right thing."
Askpolitics,"Very unlikely.  As long as people believe in fair elections and peaceful transfer of power the fight will most likely always stay at the ballot box, not the streets.  We have a presidential election coming up in 152 days, and an opportunity to choose a different path, and we still believe we can make positive change via legislative and executive decision making.  Now obviously there is a good bit of cynicism about whether this time things will actually be different, or if we are just going to have this pop up again in another couple of years, but we haven't gotten to a point where large parts of the country feel that violence is the only possible recourse."
Askpolitics,"Yes.  This far from the election head to head polling has an average error of 6%, which means the election could get 6% closer to trump (or could go the other way).  Right at this moment Biden has a 8.0% lead in RealClearPolitics polling aggregate.  That obviously looks good for Biden but the last couple of days have been really bad for Trump, so it's quite possible that once things cool down he goes back to where he's been for the last couple of months: in the 4-6% Biden lead.  Trump doesn't need to win the popular vote though, he can lose the popular vote by 2-3% and still win the EC.  Also 2020 has be so absolutely crazy that you've got to put larger than average error bars on our predictions.  Trying to figure out what the likely voter pool given the pandemic, mass mail in voting, and potentially either very low (because of risk) or very high (because of excitement) turnout, just means that the likely voter model on our polls could be further off than normal this year.  

Trumps likely electoral path is Florida, Wisconsin, and either Michigan or Arizona, ME-2 and NE-2.  Florida polling for him has been bad compared to recent historical trends, but Biden still only has a slight lead there so it's quite feasible for him to win Florida.  Wisconsin and Michigan polling has pretty variable but horrible for Trump.  Trump needs something big there, or for the polls to be off in the rust belt (they did poorly in these states in 2016).  

The basic take away should be that this is a football game where Biden came out to a quick start, and is up moderately in the first quarter.  There is a lot of game left to play, and anything can happen, but each minute that goes by without Trump scoring something big brings him closer to losing the game, and it's just as likely Biden runs up the score as Trump comes back."
Askpolitics,"The way you take down a sitting president is by waiting 2 years and defeating them at the midterm to limit their power, which the Democrats did in 2018 when they took back the House of Representatives.  The second is to wait 2 more years and defeat them for reelection.  RCP currently has Trump down 5.9% at this point in the election cycle, so the Democrats are currently winning in that regard as well (but with a long time left to go in an election cycle).  So The Democrats are currently doing what they should be doing to defeat Donald Trump."
Askpolitics,He didn't lie about anything.  The unmasking is unrelated to the FBI investigation into Flynn.  He was one of a number of people that unmasked Flynn (without the intention to target Flynn) based on NSA intelligence of some sort.
Askpolitics,"You request on unmasking because you read a report that had a masked name, and you need the name of the American to give context to whatever you are reading.  There were 40 different people that requested an unmasking that ended up being Flynn, all of which didn’t know it was Flynn when they did it, and all following protocol for unmasking.  This isn’t great news for Flynn, it shows that he was involved in something that a great many people were interested in without knowing this had anything to do with Flynn or Trump."
Askpolitics,"He's one of 40 people reading an NSA report about something that isn't even related to Flynn's investigation, that's no indication that he was involved in the FBI investigation into Flynn."
Askpolitics,Lie about what specifically?  Can you give me a source.
Askpolitics,"So unmasking is when you don't know who someone is, you just see their actions in an NSA intelligence brief, and you ask, and get approval, to find out who this person is.  Given that he, by definition, didn't know it was Flynn when he asked for the unmasking, how is it possible that this was targeting Flynn?"
Askpolitics,"One of the most consistent and intriguing things about the Trump presidency is that his polling numbers never really move.  Yes, they spike up and down sometimes, but he's gone through some huge news events (Mueller, Kavanaugh, Impeachment, Covid) but after a week or two his numbers always come back down to the same baseline (right about 42% approval).  He has been mostly in the low 40's for the last two years with very little actual change.  The reason for this is mostly likely that he's simply a polarizing figure, and people pretty quickly decided where they stood on him, and almost nothing changes that.

You could look at his strong disapproval numbers over time, maybe that's a better indication of ""hated"", but I doubt those have changed much over the last 2 years either.  What's more likely is that as we get closer to the election opinions on both sides get much louder (even if those opinions aren't actually much stronger)."
Askpolitics,"(I did this whole analysis then realized it's probably not the the best way to look at things.  The below analysis is comparing house passed bills to how frequently they eventually get passed in the Senate, which does show ""obstruction"" of any sort by the Senate, but isn't precise enough to see bills that never got brought up for vote.  I can't see a way in the [Congress.gov](https://Congress.gov) search to find that specific state, so I'll leave the analysis below.)

The 116th Congress has passed 106 of the House's 517 passed bills that originated in the House.  That comes out to 20.5% of all bills, which is the lowest amount since 1973 (the first year [congress.gov](https://congress.gov) has searchable records online).  I was surprised to see that historically the percentage of House bills the Senate passes didn't change much based on who controlled which house or who the president was.  From 1973 to 2006 the average percentage was 59.9%, and the lowest passed in any session was 50.8%.  No session since 2006 has be above the lowest prior values, and the average is 32.8%.  2006 was the ""Blue Wave"" election that made Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House for the first time.

So akin to increased use of filibuster, it's less that this session is unique than it's part of a continue degree of hyper partisanship that has been causing escalating tit for tat increased use of all available parliamentarian tools to block the other sides legislation, followed by counter parliamentarian tools to evade those blocking (filibuster countered by reconciliation for example)."
Askpolitics,"What it's saying is that neither side is working in good faith, and this process is just political theater.  Republicans aren't going to care what they hear at the hearings, they already know they are voting to confirm, and they are only agreeing to more testimony so that they don't look corrupt.  Likewise Democrats aren't going to change their mind, they are already voting against voting to confirm, and are only asking for more testimony to damage vulnerable Republicans and make them look bad for voting to confirm."
ufc,"I feel bad for the guy.  He seemed to legit want to try something outside his comfort zone, but he was in no way prepared for the UFC.  While WWE style wrestling does take a lot physicality, it's so far removed from even a vaguely-martial martial art it just isn't going to help, and Punk doesn't seem to have any other experience in martial arts.  It's like taking a top notch water polo player, give them 6 months of prep and throw them in against professionals."
Askpolitics,"You can choose to parse that however it makes sense to you, but most people when they hear ""injection inside"" in reference to a disinfectant believe he means to be asking an injecting a disinfectant."
Askpolitics,"Here is the official White House [transcript](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-31/), and here is the segment in question:

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you’re totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting.  So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it.  And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you’re going to test that too.  It sounds interesting.

ACTING UNDER SECRETARY BRYAN:  We’ll get to the right folks who could.

THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute.  One minute.  And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.  Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs.  So it would be interesting to check that.  So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with.  But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me."
Askpolitics,"The stated reason is usually that Trump is using these briefings as virtual political rallies, and therefore by broadcasting them they are giving Trump free political media time.  Some may also think that Trump is giving dangerous information at times, and therefore it's dangerous to provide his comments without context or additional information."
Askpolitics,This seems to mostly be driven by Trumps comments yesterday about the possibility of injecting disinfectants into peoples lungs as a possible way to help against covid.
Askpolitics,"Trump is extremely popular with the Republican base, which is why you saw many Republican politicians (Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz) go from actively confronting him to being fully on board the Trump Train.  So the establishment doesn't have any real choice.  Additionally, the establishment originally feared that Trump would govern from an odd centralist/populist place that never really happened.  He goes along with them on judicial picks and most policy positions, for the most part, so he isn't hurting the party right now.  He is hurting the down ticket (but first midterm for a new president is often rough), but getting rid of him would be catastrophic to the party.  Their best bet is to just ride this out, and get whatever wins they can in the meantime."
Askpolitics,"Both trends (salary not tracking with efficiency, and decreasing union workers as a % of all workers) started around the same time (early 70's), but causation in economics is always a difficult thing to prove because it's so hard to isolate variables in real conditions."
Askpolitics,"There are 3 main arguments that come up around this.  First is that while total compensation has gone up, salary has not by very much.  The reason for this is that employer supplied or supplemented health care goes into total compensation, and the rapidly increasing cost of health care is driving a large part of the compensation, not salary growth.  This isn't your employers fault, they are still paying you more in total value, it's just that health care costs ate your raise.  This leaves people with relatively flat disposable income over that time frame.

Second, while income is going up, it's not going up as fast as worker efficiency is.  That is, per hour of work American workers are producing much more efficiently than in 1981, but their compensation for that productivity isn't on par.

Third, the end result of all of this has been widening wealth inequality.  So people aren't concerned if they are making more money than they (or their parents) made in 1981, they are concerned that they have a smaller piece of the pie than the rich.  So the main issue is around the notion of what is the fair amount of income workers SHOULD be getting, compared to what they produce for society."
Askpolitics,"Because what Biden did was legal and acceptable, and what Trump did wasn't.  There is nothing inherently wrong with stopping aid to the Ukraine.  Both Biden and and Trump were within their rights to do so, but it's the purpose and mechanism that made Trumps actions impeachable.  

What Biden did was threaten to withhold future aid (which is an important distinction) from Ukraine if they didn't step up their anti-corruption efforts, specifically by firing the Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin, who had not been doing proper investigation into corruption.  This action was part of a coordinated pressure effort by the US and the EU, and was done quite publicly (hence the video of Biden bragging about it).  His actions were in furtherance of US policy and for the good of the United States.

What Trump did was privately negotiate with the President of Ukraine to acquire opposition research about his likely political opponent in the upcoming election.  That, on it's face, is illegal.  He threatened to withhold aid that had already been approved (which is illegal without congressional approval) until he got what he wanted (possibly bribery), then hid evidence of the the discussion (breaks presidential record keeping laws, and shows consciousness of guilt).  Trumps actions were for his own personal gain, and worked against the best interest of the United States."
thedivision,"Without the shield it's probably less of a tank build than a sustain build (i.e. still vulnerable to getting bursted down, still need cover, but otherwise can soak damage well).  I haven't tried it, but people suggest 4 piece System Corruption + Tardigrade (chest exotic).  Poor mans version would be Unbreakable on chest instead of Tardigrade, and you could mix in something like Bloodsucker or Leadership for some more bonus armor."
NoStupidQuestions,"The recovered rate lags well beyond the contracted rate and the death rate.  The US has over 300,000 people that are not yet marked as recovered, but the vast majority of them will be once we get a month or so further down the road."
Askpolitics,"No he is not.  Not even close.

In recent politics that honor probably goes to Walter Mondale (who lost the popular by 18%, and the EC 13-525), George McGovern (lost popular by 23%, and EC 17-520), or Barry Goldwater (lost popular by 22%, EC 52 to 486).  Neither Trump nor Biden is likely to get absolutely destroyed like those 3 candidates, so it shows a disconnect with political history to think that Biden is on par with any them.  

Further, the current lines of attack against Biden are:

* He's old and is in cognitive decline
* He's a poor public speaker
* His son is corrupt and trading off his name
* He has a troubling history with women

These all literally apply to Trump  as well, but worse in every case.  Biden isn't a strong candidate, he's not one likely to be long remembered by history, but he's far from the weakest candidate (both Clinton and Trump in 2016 were less popular than Biden is now).  He also has the good fortune to be running against a deeply unpopular candidate on the other side (which was Trumps good fortune from 2016)."
RPGdesign,"It is probably easier to leave standard dice rolling and instead change your method of evaluation.  If you roll 2d6 and your goal is to get as close to 7 as possible without going over, and 8's are the worst outcome for a miss, then you have a system that biases towards the extreme.  In such a system though you don't want to change the target number (7) because it throughs off your bell curve, and you don't want to add or subtract a flat value because you don't know which is going to be helpful/harmful to the roller.  Instead each ""plus"" someone gets (from a skill or situational bonus) could allow them to move the rolled number close to the target, likewise a negative would do the opposite.  In such a system even a single +1 would be a big deal, so I'd suggest moving to a higher die than d6 to lessen that tendency, probably around a d10 (because it's still relatively easy to add and they are common).  This kind of system also creates diminishing returns on skill level, with the difference between an unskilled (0 skill points) and slightly skilled (1 skill point) being quite large and each successive skill point being worth less and less.  If you like that, great, if not I'd suggest making skill point cost the inverse of the level (so like 5 minus the cost of the new skill or something)."
Askpolitics,"There is a general tendency to ""rally round the flag"" during times of national emergency like this.  9/11 caused bush to go from 52% up to the mid 80's, then it slowly bled back down for the rest of his first term.  So it remains to be see whether this is a short blip of support that will return to normal after some time, or if this is really people thinking Trump did such a good job that it elevates his approval to a new base."
Askpolitics,"Once the primary is over, everyone goes back to being a Democrat and has to work with other Democrats to get their policy goals accomplished.  Since the situation was starting to shift so heavily towards Biden people all dog piled on.  This is partially for party unity, and partially so they are will positioned if Biden wins the presidency."
Askpolitics,"You aren't going to find much in the way of formal analysis because there just aren't enough presidential elections in the modern era to use as a statistical sample.  Going back too far in time and the election process was so different you can't really use that for comparison.  The best you can do is find the closest 1 or 2 examples and see how things went then, but there are so many variables even that can be hard.

I would suggest that the most similar situation to Biden's is probably the Clinton win in 1992 (one that Biden is consciously mirror with his comeback kid dialog).  Clinton did not do well early, but on the strength of southern voters he had a big Super Tuesday that carried him to victory.  This obviously worked out well for Clinton, since he defeated an incumbent president, but it was also a very odd election.  There was a strong 3rd party candidate, and a popular president suffering a drop of opinion based on an ill timed recession.  The second closest is probably Mondale in 1984, and though Mondale still one the Democratic nomination he got absolutely destroyed in the general election."
AskEconomics,"I enjoyed this article, but I’d like to understand it better.  Do you have any recommendations for books that would help.  Low/mid level text books is ok, or works centered at laymen.  Specially things like ad/as curves, and monetary policy (China pegging to currency vs us pegging to inflation)?  Or really any recommendations."
AskEconomics,"To your last point, what would be the likely response by the fed to those two goals (i.e. what does it do if price stability is the goal)."
Askpolitics,"You want Bernie to win a close fight with Biden, and have Steyer below viability.  So something like 26-25-13.  Steyer, after dropping all that money ends up with 0 or a couple of delegates in the first 4 states drops out.  Biden shows he can't win even under favorable situations, so the rest of his support drops even if he doesn't drop out until after Super Tuesday.  Pete is still showing massive weakness with POC, and not doing much nationally, and Klobuchar not really ever materializing, leaves Bloomberg as the only viable moderate left standing.  Although Bernie is looking strong, he's still sitting around 30% for the most part and Warren is still around, so if Bloomberg can consolidate moderates he has a chance, especially if he stays viable in California, and wins Texas.

Bernie would also be fine in this scenario, because Biden is still his main threat, and he likely does better against Bloomberg than Biden 1v1."
NoStupidQuestions,"Anyone telling you Trump absolutely will or absolutely won't win are straight up wrong.  His odds right now are pretty close to 50/50, and there is a long time between now and the election for things to change, so even if the odds were far on one side or the other there wouldn't be much confidence in that being the final odds of it happening."
NoStupidQuestions,"For the most part, no.  To start, when Bob wins a state in the election Bob gets to pick the people that become delegates.  So Bob picks a bunch of people that he trusts to vote for him as his delegates to the electoral college.  Some states even force delegates to vote for the person they are pledged to vote for.  Every once in awhile there is a delegate that doesn't vote for who they are suppose to (called an unfaithful elector), but it's never been done in large numbers and it would be very odd for it to ever occur so as to effect the outcome of an election."
NoStupidQuestions,"Trump isn't universally hated, he's just very polarizing.  In the latest YouGov poll 66% of Americans either strongly approved or strongly disapproved of Donald Trump, with only 25% with choosing somewhat approve or disapprove.  His approval rating has generally fluctuated in the low to mid 40's, so he's mildly unpopular in total.  The end result of this is that there is a large part of the US populace that strongly dislikes him, and if you listen to them you will think everyone hates Trump.  There is also a large portion of the US that loves him, and if you listen to them you'll think he's the best president ever."
NoStupidQuestions,"If I feel significantly hungry my go to is yogurt, at around 120 calories for a single serving size of the kind I like.  If I just want something more to snack on then carrots, or an apple work well for me."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's all about what satisfies you versus the calories involved.  One of the small (what sun-maid brands mini) containers of raises has 45 calories in it.  As snacks go that's pretty low calorie, but it's also not something that is going to fill you up at all.  It's a good alternative to satisfying a sweet tooth compared to things like candy or cookies or something, but isn't great if you are actually hungry.  It's also not good if you just open a large box of raisins and chow down on them.   If you are looking for filling and low calories, many raw vegetables fit that bill, but they also tend to not be people favorite snacking food.  You just need to experiment with a selection of lower calorie options and pick the ones that work for you."
NoStupidQuestions,"In the story of Sodom and Gomorrah all the action takes place in Sodom, and Gomorrah is really just along for the ride, so it's not surprising that the name Sodom was more popular used as the base for words.  There is the word ""gomorrean"" but it's not in popular use at all."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's usually suggested that he uses a spray tan or a tanning bed, which is why he often has the ""raccoon eye"" look (for example [here](https://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/files/2018/08/trump-white-eyes.jpeg)).  It's also why a recent [photo](https://twitter.com/photowhitehouse/status/1225909811851780096/photo/1) shows such a large contrast near the hair line."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's honestly a mess, and even the documentation on the process for the IDP isn't clear on some parts.  The main takeaway from the caucus is:

1) Biden underperformed significantly, this benefited Buttigieg for the most part

2) Bernie and Pete are effectively tied, and the difference between the two is mostly spin

3) Warren over performed, but was still third.  The fact that Bernie did about as expected and Biden flailed, means she's still in the race, but not in a great position"
NoStupidQuestions,"So the Iowa Democratic Caucus is very complex, and all the viability checks and redistribution is just the start.  The first caucus is just to figure out how many county level delegates each candidate gets.  The county delegates will go to a district convention where state level delegates will be chosen, then these state level delegates will finally pick the 41 pledged delegates that Iowa sends Democratic National Convention.  State Delegate Equivalents are a way of taking the delegate counts from the county level and calculating what the expected number of state level delegates each candidate would get."
NoStupidQuestions,"It pretty much means you can't do what you are thinking of doing.  You can't bring suit against a legislature for their actions unless those actions violate federal law.  There is no law or constitutional requirement that Senators swear an oath, nor hold themselves to that oath.  The Senate determines it's own rules, so if the Senate as a whole had a problem with McConnells actions they could do something about it, but they don't so there is no remedy absent electoral change."
NoStupidQuestions,"The suit would be dismissed immediately because McConnell, like all members of Congress, have qualified immunity."

Futurology,">	In April of this year, Los Angeles became the first major city in the world to synchronize all of its 4,500 traffic lights. This effort to reduce congestion, pollution, and wasted time took 30 years and cost $400 million. 

30 years just to synchronize the lights.  That’s why you will see smart cars before smart lights, even if smart lights are easier."
NoStupidQuestions,"This was always the most likely event, but the biggest impact to come out of this on the Senate elections.  There are a number of Republican senators that voting too closely to Trump could hurt significantly.  Susan Collins being the clearest example, as her approval rating in Maine has plummeted the last two years as he reputation as a moderate has taken a hit.

There is also the issue of it simply being the correct thing to do.  The same way you might find a foreign national guilty of a crime even if they are outside the reach of your ability to extradite them for actual punishment."
NoStupidQuestions,"Given what we currently know he is almost certainly going to be acquitted, possibly as early as next week (if the Senate votes down witnesses).  The only thing that would change that is if some new news (and really big news) drops between now and the final vote.  The Democrats convincing 4 Republicans to have witnesses would elongate the trial, which even if nothing else, gives more time for such evidence to come to light.  Additionally if the witnesses provided additional, currently unknown information, that could be the catalyst for change.

In the end, though, the odds of anything like that happening are slim."
NoStupidQuestions,"The president can invoke privilege, but there is pretty much nothing he can do to prevent Bolton from testifying if Bolton is willing to testify."
NoStupidQuestions,The House is the sole determiner in what the House can impeach on.  As such they could impeachment him for the same reasons (there is no double jeopardy when it comes to impeachment) or for a different reason.
NoStupidQuestions,"Not everyone that could attended attending everything, but only the relevant committees (Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs) were allowed to attend.  This means some members that publicly stated they wanted to view the depositions couldn't (nor did they have a right to, as these were committee proceedings).  But there doesn't seem to have ever been any depositions where the Republican's on those relevant committee weren't allowed to attend.  Further, the open proceedings that followed were open to the full House.  

Ironically it was Ted Cruz today who used the old lawyer adage that ""When the facts aren't on your side you argue the law"".   That's the reasoning behind the mostly procedural arguments that the Republicans are making."
NoStupidQuestions,"Impeachment isn't a trial.  There is no right of the accused to cross reference their accusers in an impeachment.  The impeachment process does sometimes mimic elements of a trial, but even in such a case the actual impeachment (the drawing up of charges in the house) is most akin to a grand jury, where in a legal case the defendant doesn't have the right to cross-examine the witnesses.  On top of that, while Trump didn't have his own lawyers present for the impeachment, he did have Republican members of the House working on his behalf throughout the entirety of the process (both the closed depositions, and the open hearings).  So it's disingenuous to suggest that the impeachment proceedings have somehow been uniquely unfair to Trump."
NoStupidQuestions,"Today was for initial voting on the rules and amendments.  The agreed upon rules are 24 hours over 3 days for each side, followed 16 hours of questioning, then a 4 hour debate on whether to consider new witnesses (see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump#Trial_procedures)).  General senate rules on impeachment is for the trial to start every day at 1:00 p.m., six days a week.  So Democratic side will have til Friday to present their evidence.  Trumps defense will go until Tuesday the 28th.  Questions until Thursday, and debate and possible final vote on Friday the 31st."

NoStupidQuestions,"We haven't always been as partisan as we are today.  During the lead up to the potential impeachment of Nixon it became very apparent that Nixon had lost the faith of the American public, which additionally made it politically untenable for the Republicans in the Senate to continue to support him.  They informed Nixon that he was going to be found guilty so he resigned instead.  But he was almost certainly going to be removed from office if he didn't.t"
Askpolitics,"In Nixon v The United States the Supreme Court held that impeachment was inherently a “political question” not a judicial one, which is why there can be no judicial review of impeachment.  So under a strict legal parsing impeachment is a purely political process.  This may not exactly coincide with what people mean when they say “impeachment is a political process”, but it’s not wrong to say that impeachment is nonjudicial."
NoStupidQuestions,"Neither Iran nor the US wants war.  An Iranian attack on commercial airline would lead, almost assuredly, to a direct attack on Iran and the likely removal of the current government.  The Iranian leadership is not stupid or suicidal, they wouldn't do that."
NoStupidQuestions,"I agree about Ledgers joker, his agent of chaos and lack of a purpose is an important part of his character, but it's also a comic book movie, which tends to be more over the top colorful good and evil.

NoStupidQuestions,"Give them realistic motivations, and have them follow through on those.  Don't make them evil with a capital E, and give them some redeeming qualities.  It's ok if they are driven by base need (lust, or greed), but don't let them just be cartoonishly villainous."
NoStupidQuestions,"Perceived by American's as anti-American?  I think most Americans understand that governments can clash (even violently) without the people of those countries hating each other.  Their are surely Iranians that hate Americans, and Americans that hate Iranians, but I don't think the majority of Iranians hate Americans, nor do the majority of Americans think that."
NoStupidQuestions,"Depends on your definition of ""good"".  Purely focusing on the value of killing a high ranking Iranian general that has long been considered a state sponsor of terrorism, in exchange for a missile attack that killed no Americans, allies, or Iraqis and only did some property damage, followed by deescalation on both sides is a tactical ""win"" yes.  But these things aren't done in isolation, and there are many long term strategic effects of decisions such as these.  It will take a decent amount of time to determine if this action ended up being good for American foreign policy or not.  There is also the moral and legal precedents involved in the action, on top of the purely realpolitik assessments."
NoStupidQuestions,"The recent incident with the commercial plane was almost certainly an accident.  It's highly likely, at this point, that the Iranian's accidentally shot it down.  But there is almost no chance that it was intentional, or that it constitutes any risks to US commercial air traffic."
NoStupidQuestions,"It was most likely an accident.  At the time they were concerned about the possibility of US retaliation for the missile attacks, and there were lots of rumors of jets in the air.  Someone likely panicked and fired at the wrong target."
NoStupidQuestions,"Depends on what your theory is.  You can vote for the Democrat that you think you'd most want to be president if it had to be a Democrat.  In that case you either voting for Trump because you are conservative, and should vote for the most moderate of the Democrats.  Of the major candidates Biden is probably closest to that.  If you are voting for Trump because he's an outsider then the closest you can get of the major candidates is probably Sanders, although he's a long term politician (it's just his ideas make him somewhat outside the mainstream).  If you expand it to all candidates a non-politician like Yang or Steyer might be your taste.

The other alternative is if you don't want any Democrat to win under any circumstances.  In such a case you may want to vote just to try to cause the Democrats the most trouble.  In that case you'd probably want to wait until right before your primary/caucus and choose someone he isn't the leader, but is close enough to be a threat, hoping to cause disunity or to push democrats closer to a contested convention."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's not being suggested that the missile fired accidentally, only that the targeting of a civilian aircraft was accidental.  The suspected missile system was the SA-15, a vehicle based missile system with a range of around 12 km.  It would have been tracked via radar, not visual, and it was still before dawn when the incident occurred, so it was dark at the time of the incident. 

During time of high military alert such accidental shoot downs have occurred quite a few times.  Tension is high, people are twitchy, and someone thinks that they are in immediate danger and fires at the wrong target.  Remember that at the time of the shooting there were lots of rumors that US had planes in the air heading towards Iran.  Also remember that the airplane crashed 3 minutes after takeoff.  That means there had to be almost no time between initial spotting the aircraft on radar and the decision to fire the missile."
NoStupidQuestions,"All good points, but I disagree about the importance of Soleimani.  Yes killing ""Soleimani the head of quds force"" isn't a big deal.  It's not like he was a unique and unreplaceable leader.  But ""Soleimani the symbol of Iranian power"" is a big deal.  Soleimani showing up someplace was the public symbol of ""Iran backs this group/action"", and the Iranian ability to get away with all kinds of actions under the slightest veil of plausible deniability (the saudi refinery strike) made them look untouchable.  This strike puts Iran on notice that the US isn't going to stop at just Iranian proxies, and threatens the Iranian regime itself.  So I put the value of the strike as quite high, but I agree with you that the risk and cost is also extremely high.  This could end up being a very important point in modern US/Iran relations.

&#x200B;

What I wanted to make clear in my original comment, though, was that people shouldn't just dismiss this as wag the dog, that it was just a random act who's purpose was to distract.  Soleimani's name wasn't picked out of a hat, or there he was simply killed because it was the first person we got a chance to take a shot at.  There are US foreign policy reasons for his death, and the real debate is on the short term and long term costs of this action, and therefore the wisdom of it."
NoStupidQuestions,"This comes from The Beatitudes, a section of the book of Matthew in the bible.  This section focuses on a series of statements about how the weak and poor of this world will get their just rewards (an inversion from their current position) in the next.  The word ""meek"" here is a little hard to translate, and is sometimes rendered as ""gentle"".  But basically it means those that would not be in a position of power, or are not boastful and demanding, will ""inherit the Earth"", as in will be given much power/responsibility/respect."
NoStupidQuestions,"The Iranians have no real way of knowing how many people they killed.  They wouldn't have had anyone at the base to relay that information.  Also numbers started appearing on Iranian media almost immediately after the attack, before anyone, even the US government, would know the actual numbers.  They also tended to be nice round numbers (I remember 20 dead being the first number I saw), and all of this was coming originally from Iranian State media (i.e. their propaganda media) or from RT (russian government run media source).  So there is good reason to not trust any of the info coming from that side.  

As for why to trust the US numbers, it would be exceedingly difficult for the US military to hide combat deaths like this.  Not only do all the families of the victims need to be notified (and either convinced not to speak about it, or told a convincing cover story), but everyone on the base would know that people died as well.  You couldn't possibly cover up 80 US combat deaths."
NoStupidQuestions,"So Soleimani has been on the ""bad guy list"" for the US for a very long time, but as an Iranian General and VIP he isn't someone you can normally touch.  Iran, in general, has been very brazen of late (very active in Yemen, and Syria, seizing oil tankers, the drone attack against Saudi Arabia's oil refineries), and Soleimani probably has a lot to do with that.  Also, because Trump has wanted to get out of the middle east Iran thought they could do pretty much whatever the wanted, especially after the US left Syria.  So they wanted to try to push the US out of Iraq as well, which lets them be the big regional power in the middle east, which allows them to dictated foreign policy in the region.  So Iranian backed Shia militias fired rockets at a US base in December, killing an American military contractor.  These militias directly take their orders from Soleimani.  His Quds force trains, supports, and directs most of the Shia militias in the middle east, so he's their ultimate leader.  At that point the president was given a series of responses, one of which was killing Soleimani, but as I said that's usually considered too aggressive of a response, so the US hit the headquarters of the specific militia that had fired the rockets.  The militia countered by setting up the storming of the US Embassy, which lead to the death of an American citizen.  It was after that that Trumps green lit the targeting of Soleimani.  He was also meeting with the head of the militia group that was targeting the US, so they accomplished two strategic objectives in one strike.

So that's the history, now for the speculation on why.  First off, Soleimani dying is something that would be mostly a ""good thing"" for the US at any point in the last 15 years or so, but killing him was dangerous because of the likely response from Iran.  So there is a perfectly valid foreign policy reason to want him dead.  There is also a very obvious trigger for his killing.  He's directly related to the planning of operations have have recently killed Americans, and he probably was continuing to do so.  I don't know if there was actually a new big imminent plan that had to be stopped, as the official story goes, but Soleimani has been waging a low grade war with the US since the invasion of Iraq, so he's always working on some plan or another that endangers the US, it's allies, or it's goals.  

But why now and why this big of an escalation?  It could be that the specific attack on the US Embassy, the implied threat to civilian staff, and the echos of the 1979 Iranian Embassy assault might have been too much and Trump felt he needed to send a strong message that this won't be allowed.  It could also have been more the cumulative effect of all the recent activities that Iran had been involved in, and the feeling that since they are already conducting major operations against the US the US will respond in kind to let them know the cost.  Or it could just be Trumps ego and willingness to not care about the consequences and spew some hellfire towards people that were pissing him off.  I don't think, though, that impeachment or the election had much to do with it.  I don't know that Obama would have taken this course of action, but this reminds me most of a scaled down version of the US bombing of Libya under Reagan, which targeted Gaddafi directly."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's highly unlikely for there to be another draft.  It was so politically contentious the last time we tried it that it's generally thought to not be politically feasible.  Further it's unlikely that the US and Iran engage in a full scale war, or if there is war that there would be a need for a draft.

But, the last time there was large scale draft dodging those individuals were put into jail or fled the country (presuming they didn't find a way to get an draft exemption).  The threat of jail or self banishment is enough that most people, even those that significantly disagreed with the war, went and served when drafted."
NoStupidQuestions,"Iran doesn't have ICBMs (Intercontinental ballistic missiles), so they don't have a missile system capable of hitting the United States.

The United States does have ICBMS, but would almost certainly not use them against Iran because they are nuclear weapons.  ICBMs are also fired in very high arcs, reaching all the way to the edge of the earths atmosphere, before descending on the target.  Various countries would be able to detect the missile with radar, but you wouldn't be able to see it with the human eye unless you were fairly close to the eventual target.  

In either case, though, the US has forces stationed in the middle east, and they would be both the targets and the ones delivering ordnance to Iran, so don't expect to see a big missile exchange from the UK."
NoStupidQuestions,"He's speaking now, it was scheduled to start at 11:00 AM ET."
NoStupidQuestions,"What Iran was trying to do was signal that this attack was payback for the Soleimani killing, but that they didn't want to escalate further.  The threats were an attempt to not allow US forces based in foreign countries (like the US air wing at Al Dhafra airbase in the UAE) to attack Iran.  But the purpose was simply to say ""we will call it even if we both stop now, but don't push me to fight back because I will"".  The US, so far, has not responded, and given the situation it's likely that we are moving into a cooling off period.  If both sides can remain calm then things can return back to ""normal"" (which is still a tense low grade proxy war met with a pressure campaign by the US)."
NoStupidQuestions,"The ""official"" reason was to discuss negotiations with the prime minister of Iraq (according to the PM).  Unofficially though, he was meeting with Shia militia groups in Iraq (that's his main job as the head of Quds Force).  The same group he was meeting with (Kata'ib Hezbollah) was involved both in the rocket attack on US forces at the K1 base, and the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad a few days before.  At the time he was killed he was in the car with the head of KH (Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis), who was also killed."
NoStupidQuestions,"Iran likes to work via proxies, supplying and training Shia based militia groups throughout the middle east, including a number in Iraq.  Some militia groups were involved in the fighting with the US after the US invasion of Iraq, including those making IEDs.  The US routine attacked those groups, but never attacked (publicly at least) Iran.  

This kind of proxy war (and much more overt support at times) has happened frequently before.  The Chinese supported both North Korea and North Vietnam during both those works, and the US supported Afghan rebels during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.  When a major power goes to war with a smaller power the smaller power will frequently get some sort of support from the major powers enemies.  Normally this doesn't spill over into direct conflict between the major powers."
NoStupidQuestions,"The massive increase in domestic oil production caused by fracking has left the US in a much less precarious place when it comes to disruptions of it's oil supply.  So sure, the Iranians could do something like that, but all it does it destroy their own economy to inconvenience a neighbor.  Furthermore, given they know they can't really win a full war, why would they engage in one?  Iran needs some sort of retaliation to retain it's regional power image, but not one big enough to actually ignite a war.  Plus, the US populace doesn't want another war, so it would be politically dangerous for Trump to engage in one, especially one where that seems unnecessary and that we ""started"".  This means war with Iran is unlikely."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is no Russia/Syrian/Iran/Iraq pact.  There is a group of countries who's interest align at times, and who all benefit from decreased US presence in the region (Russia, Syria, Iran, Turkey), but that same group, plus the US, Iraq, and Kurdish militias, were also allied against ISIS.  But the US didn't care enough to prevent the Kurds from being attacked by the Turks, and got out of their way.

It's harder to say what Iraq wants because Iraq is a heavily divided country, and the Shia, Sunni Arab, and Kurds all have different motivations in the country.  Some of them very much want a continued US presence because the alternative is Iranian control.  Others actively want Iranian control of Iraq, and still others are trying to keep a balance so that neither the US nor Iran is predominately in control of Iraq.  

The only thing you can say for sure is that each of these countries will react in whatever way is best for their country.  Assad (in Syria) just needs to try to get his control fully under his control, and isn't going to go sending forces off somewhere to fight someone else war.  If the US and Iran got into a fight, Russia is more likely to supply the Iranians, but probably wouldn't mind another US middle east war, because that lets them go about their personal goals (like maybe reigniting the conflict in the Ukraine).  Likewise China (which sometimes gets thrown into the mix for some reason) has got lots of other pressing issues to deal with and is just glad to be out of the world headlines for a bit."
NoStupidQuestions,"Only congress can declare war, this is part of the US constitution.  But the president retains a large amount of flexibility in things that aren't quite war.  To complicate things further the US President is currently working under the legal authority of the AUMF, a fairly broad set of powers given to the president to fight terrorism (technically it's just for those that planned 9/11, but it's vague enough that it gets used as justification for a lot of things).  The last three presidents have used that authority to strike terrorist targets all over the globe with drone attacks.  

If Soleimani hadn't have been in that car, and the US had only hit the PMF commander, then this wouldn't have been an issue.  The problem is that Soleimani isn't some stateless terrorist, he's an Iranian general.  But he's also considered a sponsor of terrorist groups, as part of his position as the head of Quds, and specifically that he was working with the PMF on the recent attacks against the US forces in Iraq.  So he's definitely a viable target from the US point of view, but being a high ranking Iranian official means that this could lead to war with Iran (a declared one or an increase in the low grade informal war that the US and Iran have been fighting for years).  

The president probably still had the legal authority for the attack (this wasn't a rogue plan, it was presented and signed off on, which means white house lawyers have some legal theory on why the president can legally do it).  But the US has worked for a long time with a set of norms, on top of the legal guidelines for presidential actions, and president Trump mostly disregards them.  So, under normal situations, Trump should have warned the gang of 8 (heads on both parties in congress and the relevant committee heads on both sides) that he had green lit Soleimani, but he didn't.  That's a big part of the problem."
NoStupidQuestions,"There was a 6th century christian monk named Dionysius Exiguus who wanted to record the years based on the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ.  Prior to this is was pretty common to list the years as the number of years since the reign of the roman emperor, or since the founding of Rome, or some other historical event.  His calculations weren't great (Jesus was probably born around 4-7 B.C.) but within a few hundred years his ""Anno Domini"" system of reckoning the year became very popular in the Christian world, and in turn became the de facto system of the western world."
NoStupidQuestions,"Sure, as the US did with Iraq, but that's still a really costly conflict for the US to get involved with, with no real win out of it."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is a general concept called ""wag the dog"" (as in the tail wags the dog, instead of the other way around), that means doing something as a massive distraction to change the subject from bad press.  Frequently it's suggested that president using military action as a wag the dog situation.  That is what Trump was referring to concerning Obama, and what people are suggesting now."
NoStupidQuestions,"A fairly large number of individuals would have been involved in preparing a set of options for the president, with helping with deciding which option to take, and with actually planning the follow through on the plan.  He is the commander in chief, which gives him a lot of latitude in what he decides, but he doesn't do that by himself."
NoStupidQuestions,"The US isn't looking to actually start a war with Iran, and one is still unlikely.  A war with Iran would likely hurt Trump as much as help him, electorally, and the decision to target Soleimani likely had almost nothing to do with impeachment or the election.  It was a heavily escalation, but tensions with Iran have been going on since near the beginning of the Trump administration, and had been rapidly escalating prior to the killing of Soleimani."
SanJoseSharks,"Martin Jones has an .890 save percentage.  That places him 65th in the league.  Which is pretty impressive given there are only 31 teams.  This not only means he has the worst save percentage of any starting goaltender, he's worse than almost every major goalie in the league.  The only goalies with more than 10 games that are worse are Jimmy Howard (Detroit backup) and Laurent Brossoit (Winnipeg backup).  

So the question is not if Jones is the sharks #1 (because he isn't), the question is is Jones still even a backup level goaltender in the NHL.  His stats suggest he isn't.  The sharks haven't played great defense in front of him, but at some point you have to actually stop shots and Jones hasn't."
NoStupidQuestions,"We wouldn’t even need nukes for that, we could choose to destroy Iran any time we wished, but the backlash for that action is potentially so damaging to world stability that we likely wouldn’t under current conditions.  The Iranians know this which is why they can fund militias that work against US interest and have at times directly combatted us troops."
NoStupidQuestions,"Qasem Soleimani was the intended target, and he was killed in the attack.  It happened just outside the Baghdad international airport, after Soleimani was picked up by the head of Kata'ib Hezbollah (Iranian backed militia in Iraq).  KH killed a US military contractor when it fired rockets into a US base in Iraq.  The US responded by bombing the KH headquarters.  This caused KH to back a protest and storming of the US Embassy in Baghdad, which killed 1 american civilian, and injured 4 servicemen.  The killing of Soleimani was retaliation for that assault.  Soleimani was the head of the Quds force, which organizes most all of the various Shia militias and terrorist groups in the middle east, and therefore is ultimately responsible for the series of events that lead up to his dead.  Because he is a formal high ranking member of the Iranian government, though, this is a much larger escalation that most of the targeted killings the US engages in."
NoStupidQuestions,"I don't know that it does.  When George W Bush invaded Iraq his approval rating spiked for 4 or 5 months, but quickly dropped back down to lower than it had been before the Iraqi invasion.  He won a second term, but it's questionable that the Iraq war was the reason behind that.

George HW Bush lost his reelection after the first Iraq War, even though it was possibly the most successfully executed war in US history.

While Johnson won his first reelection/election (having taken over from Kennedy after his assassination), the Democrats lost the presidency in 1968, during the Vietnam war."
NoStupidQuestions,"The issue is that neither country constitutes a current existential threat to the other.  What's going on is competing spheres of influence.  Iran has managed to grow it's regional power and has been flexing it's ability recently.  It would like to continue to be one of, if not the, regional power of the ME.  It can't do that if it gets into an actual war.  Their current short term objective is to decrease the US military presence in the region.  But that's not worth risking a ""regime change"" war where they could lose everything.

The US wants long term strategic flexibility in the region, and stability.  They are fighting to balance those two things.  A war in Iran definitely destroys stability, so it's unwanted.  The only way the US decides to actually attack Iran is if they so fear getting pushed out of the ME that they would fight to stay there.  Trump has campaigned on the exact opposite though, and the American people really don't have much stomach for the forever war mentality.  If push comes to shove the US might rather abandon Iraq than fight Iran.  That possibility is the likely cause of recent Iranian hostilities."
NoStupidQuestions,"Under any other administration I would say 0%.  Even under Trump (who's made a habit of norm breaking) it's still very slight.  The Japanese internment is still consider a black time in American history for most, the American people don't want to get involved in another middle east conflict, nor do they have much enmity for the Iranian people.  Any attempt to intern Iranian-Americans would undoubtedly cause protests and additional calls for removing the president."
NoStupidQuestions,"Neither Iran nor the US wants a full shooting war.  It would be another middle east quagmire for the US, and it would mean the end of the current regime for Iran (regardless of anything else that happens).  Because of this neither side is likely to cross the line that starts a war.  The risk is that both sides have been playing with fire as to how close to the line they can get, and if one miscalculates then we could end up in an actual war.  Even in that case, though, it's highly unlikely that 3rd parties would want to jump in on that conflict.  The ""allies"" (more friends of convenience) of Iran would rather just watch the US stick itself in another long term problem area further bogging down the US military, which allows them to exert more power elsewhere.  US allies don't want to follow the US into another adventure in the ME, and would likely sit this one out."
NoStupidQuestions,"The obvious historical comparison is the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand leading to WWI.  But that was a situation where everything was already primed for war and was waiting for the trigger.  Also the world is in a different place now.  The massive interconnected global economy, mixed with WMDs makes both the value of full scale war much lower, and the cost much higher.  This makes wars between major world powers less likely.  Paradoxically though, this makes smaller conflicts more likely, because of the reluctance to go to war things that prior might have started a war don't lead to war meaning countries can get away with operations just short of war more frequently.  

This has lead to ""interesting"" times, where people don't really know where the line between ""bad but acceptable"" and ""over the red line"" are.  If we do end up in a major war it will likely be because someone significantly mistakes where the line of ""bad but acceptable"" behavior is."
NoStupidQuestions,Yes.  Improbable things become common when you do them frequently enough.
NoStupidQuestions,"The US and Iran have been engaged in an escalating armed conflict over the last couple of weeks.  This has lead people to be concerned about the possibility of this escalation leading to a war between Iran and the US, and some (mostly joking) comments about WWIII starting.  The reality is that the odds of a war are low and the chances of that escalating to an actual world war are negligible."
NoStupidQuestions,"On American roulette wheels the odds of hitting any given value is 1/38.  The odds of 3 successive values hitting the same value is 1/1444.  At a normal pace of a roulette wheel this should happen about once every 32 hours of play.  To specifically hit 26 three times in a row has odds of 1/54872.  That should happen about once every 51 days on any given roulette wheel.  With dozens of wheels in a casino, and many people playing, odds of someone seeing 26 coming up 3 times in a row is very frequent, and odd occurrences tend to be the ones people remember."
NoStupidQuestions,"They definitely will do something, the question is what.  They have a range of responses available to them.  The majority would be focused on US and US allies in the region.  More likely military targets or infrastructure, not likely civilian (possible, just not the likely).  It would be very bad for their control of the region to simply not respond at all.  Likewise they do not want this to escalate to a full scale war.  So they will carefully pick their level of retaliation."
NoStupidQuestions,The US and Iranian have been at low grade conflict since the the Invasion of Iraq (and advisories for much longer than that).  The Quds (which Soleimani ran) was supplying and training bomb makers in Iraq to make more complex IEDs.  The most recent trigger though was Iranian backed rebels shooting rockets at a US base killing an American military contractor.
NoStupidQuestions,"People are concerned that a US war with Iran would prompt Russia to back Iran, which would bring NATO in on the US side, but that is exceedingly unlikely to happen.  It's unlikely that we will get involved in even a full shooting war with Iran."
NoStupidQuestions,"Iran fights via proxies.  It's generally worked for them well the last decade or so, and has given them a lot of regional power, but they don't want to get involved in a full scale war with the US.  The Iranian government are rational actors, they aren't suicidal cultists.  As such their primary motivations is their own continued rulership of Iran, and their ability to expand their regional sphere of influence."
NoStupidQuestions,"You really shouldn't be worried.  Iran is unlikely to take the tactically risky (Iran is pretty good regionally, but doesn't have global reach) and strategically extremely risky (a US based attack would probably lead to a massive reaction from the US) actions like that.  Even if they decided to, the odds of you personally being affected are extremely unlikely.  You should fear travel to the US any more than you would normally."
NoStupidQuestions,"The PMF started the most recent series of events, but there is obviously a lot of history going on here.  The Iranians are currently in a proxy war in Yemen with our allies the Saudis.  The Iranian attack on the oil facility at Abqaiq resulted in an increase of US troops and material support for the Saudis.  Likewise everyone has been involved in the Syrian civil war.  While everyone involved worked roughly together to kill ISIS, they definitely all had different ideas of what a post-ISIS Syria would look like, and there was fighting at times between different militias backed by different sides.  So the US and Iran are in a number of different proxy fights with each other and the most recent events are to some degree a continuation of the low grade hostilities that have been going on since at least the US invasion of Iraq.

The Soleimani killing was a pretty serious escalation though.  It's like going to a bar and sitting next to a guy you've had problems with in the past.  Both of you have words.  Iran gives the US a shove, which the US immediately shoves back.  Iran gets pissed and punches the US in the gut, and the US pulls a gun and shoots Iran in the knee.  Right now Iran is shot in a place that hurts, but isn't life threatening.  They really want to shoot back some way, but both both sides don't really want to get into a full out gunfight, and everyone else in the bar is watching to see what happens."
NoStupidQuestions,"He's an Iranian General who's in charge of the Quds Forces (part of the IRGC, Iranian Special Forces).  It's kind of like a combination of US Special Forces and the CIA.  What Soleimani was in charge of was coordinating all the mostly Shia based militias in the middle east.  Groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Palestine, the Houtis in Yemen, and the PMF in Iraq are all coordinated through Quds, and therefore take, directly or indirectly, their orders from Soleimani.

The recent series of events involved the PMF.  The PMF is a large umbrella organizations of Shia militias in Iraq.  One portion of that (Kata'ib Hezbollah) was involved in firing rockets into a US base, killing a US military contractor.  To retaliate the US bombed the KH headquarters, killing 25.  To re-retaliate KH organized a storming of the US embassy in Baghdad, killing 1 American and injuring 4.  To re-re-retaliate the US bombed a car that contained both Soleimani (who was meeting with KH in Baghdad) and the head of KH and second in charge of the PMF.

Soleimani has been on the ""bad guy"" list for the US for a long time, but we have been unwilling to kill him because of the likely retaliation we would see from Iran if we did.  There is an almost certainty that Iran will react somehow to the attack, it's just a question of where and how."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is almost no chance of WWIII occurring over something like this, in fact there is a pretty small chance of this leading to an actual shooting war.  The most likely retaliation will be attacks on US forces in the Middle East, Iraq mostly, but anything in the region that could be vulnerable is a target.  Expect a large number of smaller attacks.  While this is bad, and may end up spilling more blood than if we had not have killed Soleimani, we've been in a very low grade war with Iran for 15 years now.  The Quds (the force Soleimani was in charge of) was training and aiding Iraqi insurgent groups to kill American soldiers since the US invasion of Iraq.  Iran had also been increasing it's acting in the last 18 months or so, with attacks like the drone attack on the Saudi Abqaiq oil refinery plant.  So the attack needs to be viewed through the lens of a series of escalations, but neither side really wants a hot war."
NoStupidQuestions,It's still doubtful for this to escalate to the level of full scale war between the US and Iran (because neither side really wants that).  The most likely event is an increase of asymmetric attacks by Iranian based militias around the middle east.
NoStupidQuestions,"Suleimani was responsible for running all extraterritorial efforts by Iran.  That means he is  responsible for working with Iran's proxy organizations throughout the middle east.  That makes him ultimately responsible for the assault on the US Embassy in Baghdad.  He was also the one helping teach Iraqi insurgents how to make better IEDs to kill American soldiers for the last 15 years.  So he's definitely a ""bad guy"", and the US had reasons to want him dead.  The question is, and has always been, what are the strategic consequences of killing such a high profile national of a potentially belligerent nation."

NoStupidQuestions,"So Mary Sue was originally a specific term related to fan fiction, when a person would put a character in their story that is supposed to be themselves, and then makes that person super important/powerful to be used for wish fulfillment more than for story purposes.  Over time the original meaning has shifted and can sometimes just be used to mean ""super over powered good at everything character"".  

Because Rey's character is good at a large number of things, without training or even really trying, she is sometimes considered a Mary Sue.  She is the protagonist though, in a story where she is a special magical endowed individual (much like Luke from the original trilogy).  This is not all that uncommon in fantasy stories (star wars is a space opera, mostly a fantasy story in space) or superhero stories."

NoStupidQuestions,"Revelations 13:18

>This calls for wisdom: let anyone with understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a person. Its number is six hundred sixty-six.

The books of Revelations in the Bible is full of very symbolic writing.  This is because it is written in a style called apocalyptic literature.  This type of literature is full of symbols and specifically lots of symbolic numbers.  This has lead to people interpret Revelations in many different ways.  One common way is to attribute the character of The Beast to the Devil, and therefore to interpret 666 as related to the Devil.

The leading scholarly opinion is that Revelations is mostly a comment on the political situation at the time of the writing, mostly about the Emperor Domitian (who was persecuting Christians).  The apocalyptic style hid the comments, allowing them to be spread with less fear of the true content being discerned.  In this interpretation The Beast is actually the Emperor Nero (666 would have been one way to represent the name Nero in jewish numerology).  While Nero had died prior, there was a widespread belief that he wasn't actually dead, but instead in hiding and would return.  If you read the verse with this mindset, it's pretty clear what's going on.  It specifically says that the Beast is a person, and says ""anyone with understanding calculate the number"", meaning to use numerology to figure out who the writer is talking about."
NoStupidQuestions,"Both early battle royale games (which started as mods of other games), and Hunger Games were inspired by the Japanese movie Battle Royale from 2000."
NoStupidQuestions,"Currently Nancy Pelosi is stalling on presenting articles of impeachment to the Senate, so there is no date for the Trial.  Her stated reasoning for this is to ""ensure a fair trial"".  This could be the actual reason, in which case she's trying to apply pressure to moderate Republicans in the Senate to vote for trial witnesses (McConnell doesn't set the agenda for impeachment, whatever can get 51 votes in the Senate sets the agenda).  Or she could just be leaving things open because she knows the Senate is highly likely to acquit and she wants to deny Trump the press coverage of an acquittal.   She could also be waiting until 2021 in case Trump wins the presidency but the Democrats take the Senate.  This wouldn't greatly change the odds of Trump being removed, but would allow for an expansive trial in the Senate.

If their is a trial, it will likely be quick.  There may be no witnesses, just a presenting of the evidence and a vote.  If there are witnesses the list will likely be short (less than 10), and the trial would last a couple of weeks.  A long drawn out trial is unlikely because Republicans wouldn't want that.  They are extremely unlikely to find Trump guilty, but they also don't want to spend a lot of time putting on a big defense of Trumps actions."
NoStupidQuestions,"Infrared homing (heat seeking) missiles, specifically wouldn't give any indication that they are targeting you.  Missiles tend to either have active guidance (some sort of signal is projected onto the target and followed), or passive (tracking via infrared or camera without sending out a signal), although their are more complex hybrids.  The active guidance frequently uses radar to track the target.  There isn't going to be an audible sound coming from the missile, but the target may be able to detect the radar pings and could make an audible sound to indicate the tracking."
NoStupidQuestions,"Unless something very significant happens he is unlikely to be found guilty in the Senate.  As such the more likely occurrence is he is voted out of office Nov 3 2020, and leaves office Jan 20, 2021, or he retains his office for a second term and is president until Jan 2025."
NoStupidQuestions,"On TV shows the Head Writer or the Show Runner (frequently the same person) is the one that drives the development of the story.  Frequently different directs will direct the individual episodes, but they are mostly subservient to the Head Writer.

For movies it's opposite.  The Director drives everything, including the story.  Movies frequently have a large number of different writers that work on different elements or drafts, and the final decisions on which script or which parts of who's scripts go into the final drafts is mostly on the Director.  For example, the Wonder Woman movie had around 50 separate writers on it, because they used a process of bringing in multiple writers rooms to build different scripts then took the elements they liked the best out of all the movies to build the final movie."
NoStupidQuestions,"So if you just placed a ball a couple feet away from you gravity would pull the ball towards you and you towards the ball, until the two of you connect.  For something to orbit it needs to be moving at a set speed given the gravitation pull and the distance between the objects.  So with some math and a precise way to launch the ball at the correct speed it would orbit you.  The problem is that any time you move your center of mass changes, which is going to lead to an unstable orbit that will eventually decay."
NoStupidQuestions,"Star Wars famously followed Joseph Campbells A Hero's Journey.  Campbell studied comparatively mythology, and felt there was an underlying story that all heroes tend to follow.

NoStupidQuestions,"Gnostic/Agnostic, and Theist/Atheist are two different axises, and you can be any combination of the 4 pairs (although Gnostic Atheist is very rare).  Gnostic/Agnostic is about whether the supernatural realm (including God) is a knowable thing.  Agnostic says it is beyond our ability to determine, while Gnostics say they can know that the supernatural exists.  Anyone that believes in one or more deities is a Theist, anyone who doesn't believe in any gods is an Atheist."
NoStupidQuestions,"If you mean from a purely political point of view, it's likely that impeachment hurts Republicans slightly more than Democrats.  While Trump has a strong and passionate base, he is moderately unpopular as a whole.  Since his passionate base was already likely to turn out, it is good to give others, especially moderates, a reason to vote him out.  Plus, pure base versus base elections are generally better for Democrats.  Republican voters are  higher turnout on average, so they do well in low turnout years.  That advantage is neutralized if both bases are energized.  Also, by making the 2020 election a referendum on Trump, they apply pressure on Republicans in the House and Senate, who need to run on their support of Trump and less on their personal agenda (which may remain popular)."
Askpolitics,"Because the line of success goes both through the House (Speaker of the House), and the Senate (President pro tempore of the Senate), you would need the resignation of the entire cabinet and every member of the House and Senate.  That would only occur with a complete failing of the government, and the most likely outcome of that would be a constitutional convention to address whatever problem was occurring that literally no one wants to be president."
NoStupidQuestions,"One of the people making this accusation is Gordon Sondland.  Sondland was a very large donor to Trump's campaign, and was chosen by Trump both to be his EU ambassador, and to assist in the Ukraine dealings.  Which means there is very little reason for him to lie about something that hurts Trump, was very resistant to testify, going went so far as to probably perjure himself to protect Trump.  This means his first hand knowledge of the situation is pretty damning.  Further, he states, by name, that John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Ulrich Brechbuhl and Mike Pence knew about this.  So if Trump wanted to contest this claim all he needs to do is allow one or more of them to testify and state that this is untrue.  His unwillingness to do this either means they cannot contest this claim without perjuring themselves (which they don't want to do), or that they know other more damaging things and can't risk those things getting out.  In either case the uncontested first hand information is enough on it's own."
NoStupidQuestions,"Trump asking for a favor isn't the problem, it's what he was asking for that was the problem.  From solely the transcript Trump committed a crime.  Soliciting a foreign power for something of value (opposition research is something of value) concerning an election is illegal (52 U.S. Code § 30121(a)(2) ).  Further, the people around Trump were so alarmed by the action that they hid the transcript, then when the whistleblower report was filed they tried to hide it from Congress.  This is what lawyers call ""consciousness of guilt"", it shows that they knew their actions were illegal because they tried to hide their actions.  

So Trump definitely committed an impeachable offense.  Yes, Democrats would love to remove Trump from office, but they can't do that without Republican support, so removal was never a serious threat to Trump unless his own party turns on him.  Impeachment is more about being able to say they did the correct thing given Trumps actions."
Askpolitics,"If he is found guilty in his impeachment trial (which is doubtful) the punishment is removal from office, but can also include being banned from holding office again.

He is also fairly likely to create his own media outlet, and impact politics through that."

But enough people were present or read in on the call that the whistleblower heard from multiple people that they were concerned about the call.  The whistleblower went through proper channels to provide proper oversight, but Attorney General Barr blocked the whistleblower report from getting to congress.  When information started to leak that a ""damaging whistleblower report"" was being withheld from congress, Democrats started to talk about legal action to obtain the report.  At this point, after having already read the whistleblower report and knowing it correctly detailed the contents of the memo (it's technically not a transcript), then the president released the memo to try to get out ahead of the story, and to act like they are being completely open about what happened."

Nothing says this more than JJ setting up the huge emotional cliff hanger of Rey handing Luke his lightsaber and Rian literally throwing it away, followed by Rian deciding that Rey’s mystery heritage is silly and undermines the whole thing, which JJ then just ignores and makes it the core element of the story in Episode 9."
NoStupidQuestions,"So the ancients were pretty smart, and a guy Posidonius used the angle of star measured in Rhodes and Alexandria.  His measurement was pretty close to correct, unfortunately it was measured using a distance called stadia, and the greeks and the romans both used this measurement, but that had different sizes for them.  So when Ptolemy wrote his book Geography he used the smaller of the two sizes (which was 33% too small), instead of the larger (about 2.5% too small).  Columbus used Ptolemy's number, so he thought Asia would be much closer to Europe.  When he landed in the Bahamas he thought he was in the East Indies (a large area encompassing most of south east asia)."
NoStupidQuestions,"The salary for 435 congressman is $75M.  The total outlays for the US federal government is just under $4T.  So congress' salary is 0.0019% of what the government pays for every year.  It is a trivial amount.

So on top of the reasons for wanting a bicameral legislature, it is absurdly cheap compared to most government operations.  It's a rounding error on our military budget."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is no due process for impeachment.  Impeachment is solely a political operation, not a judicial one.  See Nixon vs. United States, which states that explicitly, and makes it clear there is no judicial oversight on impeachment.  The House has sole power of impeachment, and the house determines it's own rules, including on impeachment.  Pelosi has every right to withhold impeachment articles.  It breaks norms, but norms have almost completely broken down at this point, as they have been slipping away for a decade or longer.

Likewise, McConnell (as long as he retains the support of 50 senators) can, if he receives the articles, simply have an immediate vote and acquittal.  Or he could have a minimal trial.  Again, this breaks norms, but he's fully within his power to do so.

""No Due Process"" isn't a legal argument (because it's not even been true), it's a PR argument.  Of course, given the near certainty of acquittal in the Senate, all impeachment has ever been is a PR battle, so it's as valid as any other PR argument."
NoStupidQuestions,"Impeachment isn't meant to do anything other than start a trial.  It's a grand jury indictment.

NoStupidQuestions,"Maybe, but letting misinformation sit unquestioned makes people think there is no valid answer and it is correct.  Some people have absolute faith that they are correct and no answer will ever change that.  There isn’t much way to get to those people, but you don’t need to.  You need to convince the people that actually don’t know the answer to these questions and are willing to evaluate.  The person who asked this question may be one of those people (I default to the presumption that the questions are in good faith), but either way it’s worth answering."
NoStupidQuestions,"While impeachment has some political value, after sending impeachment to the senate for trial there isn’t much chance of a conviction, or even much of a trial.  By no moving forward Trump is impeached but can’t be acquitted.  At the same time Pelosi can blame McConnell for no providing a fair trial as the reason she can’t move forward.  It is not a huge win, but may be the best outcome given the circumstances."

There is also very little Americans can do to make the lives of your average Chinese person better.  What we could do, though, is help undocumented workers in the US have a better life.  There are large numbers of undocumented migrant farm workers that come here to make money to send back home.  They do a hard job, with long hours, for below minimum wage.  Some of them have to deal with corrupt managers that abuse them because they know they can't go to the police, because of their undocumented nature."

NoStupidQuestions,"The founders gave very broad impeachment powers specifically because they did not want to limit the power because of their own lack of forethought.  The constitution gives the house ""sole power of impeachment"" (Art 1, Sec 2, Clause 5), and the Senate ""sole Power to try all Impeachments"" (Art 1, Sec 3, Clause 6).  This is the only powers that the founders used the word ""sole"" for.  The supreme court (in Nixon v. United States), holds that the judiciary has no ability to review impeachments, that it is a political question, not a legal one.  While many have lamented this fact, the fact remains what is an impeachable offense is defined solely by the House of Representatives.  The fact that the house past articles of impeachment means, by definition, his conduct was impeachable.

You can defend the President by arguing that he did not commit the actions he's accused of, or you can argue that his offenses do not rise to the level of requiring removal from office, but ""he can't be impeached for that"" is simply incorrect."

NoStupidQuestions,">Is the president allowed to withhold aid? Like, is that within his toolbox of powers?

Not in the way he did.  The Ukraine aid package was part of the budget, which was signed into law by Trump, meaning the executive branch is bound to release the aid.  Now the president has the ability to Impound these funds.  This means he holds the funds for up to 45 days and requests Congress to rescind a portion of the budget.  Trump, in fact, started this process before dropping the request.  It was highly unlikely that congress would have rescinded the Ukraine funds though.

The president was legally allowed to reject a budget that included funding for aid, or to have convinced congress that for some reason (corruption for example) he could have had it rescinded after the fact, but he can't just not follow through on an approved budget.

&#x200B;

>If not, how was Trump able to accomplish it?

The executive branch can choose not to follow the law, or to question the validity of the law, as they are in complete control of the executive actions of the government.  The only thing that stops them is checks and balances of the other two branches (via court order or impeachment), or the refusal of the bureaucracy to follow through on an illegal act.

&#x200B;

>And if so, then isn’t it Trump’s decision to make? Or is it only the motivation that makes it not allowed?

A political official can have the legal authority to do something, but still be corrupt in the way they use that power.  For example, Rod Blagojevich had the legal authority to select an interim Senator for the vacant seat left by Obama leaving office to assume the presidency.  He could have chosen anyone he wanted for nearly any reason he wanted, but he solicited a bribe to fill the slot and went to prison for it.

If Trump followed the rules and blocked the aid by legal means, and he wasn't doing it for corrupt purposes, then he would have been fine.  This is what VP Biden did with Ukraine.  He was threatening continuing future aid, and he was doing it to further the US and International agenda."
NoStupidQuestions,"Impeachment itself (unless he is tried and convicted in the Senate, which is exceedingly doubtful) doesn't legally impact Trumps ability to be reelected.  Additionally polling seems to align pretty well with existing opinions (people that don't like Trump are happy he is impeached, and people that like him are unhappy with it), meaning it's not likely to have a large impact on election odds."
NoStupidQuestions,"Everything he prior had the power to do.  Impeachment is just a formal drawing up of charges against the president.  He would need to be tried and convicted in the Senate for any change to occur.  Even then the only punishment is removal from office, and if removed they may additionally bar him from holding future office.  There is no way to limit Trumps power (baring a constitutional amendment) other than removing him from office, or defeating him in the next election."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is a semantic argument about whether impeachment is ""over"" or not.  The constitution broadly sets out out that the house in in charge of impeachment.  

Article I, Section 2, Clause 5:

>The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

and the Senate in charge of the trial.

Article I, Section 3, Clause 6:

>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

It's also clear that these are two separate process, an impeachment in the house, and a trial in the senate.

Article 2, Section 4:

>The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

So where do we sit right now.  The House has voted and passed a resolution of impeachment.  The Senate requires the House to send over the articles of impeachment and present them to the Senate.  But that's not a constitutional requirement, and Senate rules can't bind the House's behavior.  So the articles are currently stuck in limbo between the Impeachment and the Trial.  This has lead some of the president defenders to argue that the House hasn't ""really impeached"" the president because they are holding up the final process of handing over the articles, but the House has the sole right to conduct Impeachment and the majority of the House says he's impeached.  It is clear, though, that Pelosi is the one holding the articles currently."
NoStupidQuestions,"That only matters if you have a presumptions on what ""fit"" means.  Fit means whatever lets you survive and breed, so by definition if a person with a deformed leg survives and breeds, it is fit given it's current environment.  Humans a social creatures, we survive, as a group, better because of this.  The genes that make us want to help those with a lame lag, is also the same gene that lets me survive if I break my leg (from a random mistake with no genetic component). 

Secondly, evolution is a statistics game.  While it's possible that any given person with a severe physical or mental disability  survives and breeds, their odds go down.  Over the course of time, across the entire gene pool, it's still going to be negatively impact your odds of surviving to have children, which means it will be selected against.  Most evolutionary traits aren't giant wins or losses, they are small changes to your odds.  For example, humans are currently in the process of evolving adult lactose tolerance.  This only started after we starting keeping herd animals, because it wouldn't have been beneficial before.  It's slowly grown to be fairly dominant in regions that have historically been pastoral (North Europe for example) but is still almost absent in other areas (Large parts of Asia).  The ability to drink milk isn't something that one would consider literally life or death, but you can imagine cases where having access to an additional food source, that gives you a bit more average calories, protects against missing on a hunt, or a bad crop yield, and over time becomes more frequent in the gene pool.  The same way a lame leg is unlikely to provide anything in the way of a genetic advantage, and could definitely be a small drawback.  It may additionally have a negative impact on sexual selection, which would also decrease it's frequency in the gene pool."
NoStupidQuestions,"The calendars that predate the Julian Calendar originally had Quintilis for the 5th month, and Sextilis for the 6th month, but Julius Caesar decided to name two of the months after himself, Julius (that became July) and Augustus (that became August)."
NoStupidQuestions,"Everyone survives equally?   There is literally no gene that makes someone more or less likely to survive and breed?  Evolution is simply allele frequency change in a population over time.  If any allele gives a differential likelihood of surviving to breed then natural selection will probabilistically favor that allele, and the odds increase of that allele occurring in greater frequency than other competing alleles.  There are alleles like CCR5-D32 which provides a level of immunity to HIV (and it's suggested it might have prior helped with bubonic plague), that is one of the most recently occurring alleles under selective pressure.  The relatively large human population compared to most large mammals means we are generating more mutations per generation than other species.  Mutations are the raw material that evolution works on, giving more opportunities for natural selection to occur.  On top of that, natural selection is only 1 of the 3 major mechanisms of evolution.  Modern medicine doesn't ""break"" evolution, it just changes the definition of fitness."
NoStupidQuestions,"This is incorrect. There is no universal notion of fitness.  Everything evolves towards fitness with respect to the current environment they live in.  Humans are currently evolving towards whatever is optimal given our current level of technology.  We would do less well if that level of technology went away.  That is no different than the fact that we are evolving towards whatever is optimal with the current climate, and would do less well if we had another ice age.  This is true for all species all the time.  Birds would do poorly if they couldn’t build nests, cheetah would do poorly if Thomson’s gazelles go exist, and Koala are currently going extinct because climate change is destroying their environment."
NoStupidQuestions,"The concept of “fast” isn’t very meaningful in an evolutionary sense.  We can measure things like how fast new mutations become fixed in a species.  This is effected by how fast new mutations enter the gene pool (which is determined by the number of individuals of a species, and the time between generations) and how long it takes for those mutations to replace all other versions of of the gene.  Small, fast breeding species tend to have very large number of individuals, which means they create new mutations fast, but they are slow to become fixed because there are so many individuals.  The opposite is true of the larger slower breeding species, that tend to have small numbers of individuals.  This tends to make the speed of evolution very similar in both groups.  So most species evolve at near the same speed.  But even then, this is just a measure of the rate of genetic change, but different changes to different genes will have much smaller or larger changes to the species.  The other major problem is that according to punctuated equilibrium (one of the major theories within evolution) species tend to become optimized towards the current environment, and then not change much (reaching an equilibrium) until something changes the current environment, then everything rapidly evolves until it reaches a new equilibrium."
NoStupidQuestions,"Two things.  First the “high” part of “high crimes and misdemeanors” was not meant to be in relationship to the seriousness of the crimes, but to the “highness” of office.  Abuse of position is the fundamental reason for impeachment to exist.  There are criminal courts for standard illegal actions, impeachment exists to cover the other cases of abuse.  If a president commits a normal crime (as he likely did with regard to his porn star payout) it isn’t actually a good reason to impeach them.  So abuse of power is the correct charge for a president.

Secondly the charge is combining at least 4 related corrupt acts:

1) Soliciting election assistance from a foreign power
2) Bribery (quid pro quo)
3) Withholding aid (it was passed and signed, he had no statutory authority to block the aid)
4) Endangering foreign policy for personal gain

Collectively they represent abuse of power."
NoStupidQuestions,"He's accused of breaking 52 U.S. Code § 30121(a)(2) - Contributions and donations by foreign nationals.  Soliciting or accepting something of value (opposition research) from a foreign national to assist in a campaign for public office is illegal.  From the memorandum of the call that Trump released he clearly asks Zelensky to ""do him a favor"" and investigate Biden's involvement in firing a prosecutor who was investigating his son."
NoStupidQuestions,"Yes.  There is no limit in the constitution about how many times an official can be impeached.  And while impeachment proceedings mimic legal proceedings, they are not the same.  Meaning there is no double jeopardy or similar restrictions.  So if something new occurs the House can have another impeachment vote, if they wanted to amend the existing articles they could impeach again, or if they wait until 2020 and Trump is reelected they could impeach on previous charges or new ones and hope the new Senate is more amenable.

If you go to a big city you still see people working fast food jobs, and stocking food at the grocery store.  These people, by and large, aren't homeless, so they can obviously afford to live somewhere.

If the assassin attempted the murder and failed they would additionally have committed ""Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder"" which is a second Base Offense Level 33 offense, which means the assassin may or may not get a longer sentence.  If the assassin succeeds they would be guilty of ""First Degree Murder"", which is a Base Offense Level 43 offense, meaning they should get more jail time than the conspirator."

The lack of a negative reaction ""proves"" that you must be friends, because you would not otherwise react that way.

NoStupidQuestions,"Your friend is completely incorrect.  Pence would become president, and then he can decide who he would like to get rid of and who to keep.  All of Trumps judicial choices, including Supreme Court, would stay, as they can only be removed agains their will by impeachment themselves."

While hyenas are a member of the feliforms, they are more closely rated to mongooses than they are to cats.  The caniforms are even more diverse, including species like seals, raccoons and bears."
Askpolitics,"There were two that voted against both counts:

Collin Peterson \[MN 7th\] - He's actually a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labour party, but it's affiliated with the Democratic Party.  He's a long term Democrat in a very Republican district (R+12) that voted for Trump by 30 points.  He pretty much needs to vote against impeachment to survive.

Jeff Van Drew \[NJ 2nd\] - This one is a little harder to understand.  He's a moderate Democrat, but in a pretty even district.  He left the Democratic Party as part of this vote.

There was one that voted yes on one count and no on the other.  

Jared Golden \[ME 2nd\] - Golden's vote is still a vote for impeachment, so it seems mostly like a nuanced position that allows him to some wiggle room in term of messaging.

The final voted present

Tulsi Gabbard \[HI 2nd\] - Tulsi is running for president, and has some very heterodox ideas for a Democrat.  She's trying to position her vote as ""above the partisanship"" even though she says she thinks Trump is guilty."
NoStupidQuestions,"Trump is accused of abusing his position of power, and endanger US foreign policy, to interfere in the upcoming election, when he was already to beneficiary of interference by a foreign power in his last election.  The concern is that, if left uncheck, Trump will use foreign powers interfering in the next election to allow him to unjustly win a second term."
NoStupidQuestions,"Sure, but that was already true.  The Republicans impeached Clinton over less than Trump is being impeached over, so it's unlikely to change the situation much at all."
NoStupidQuestions,"It’s 20 of the 53 Republicans plus all of the Democrats.  Impeached was intended as an extreme remedy for extreme situations, and as such needs very broad approval to be used.  So it’s not something even historical large majorities can do single party for the most part."
Askpolitics,Yes.  You can see the resolution [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/755).
NoStupidQuestions,"You would need 20 republicans to turn on Trump.  There aren't anywhere near 20 that are likely to turn on him given the current environment (Trump still being extremely popular with Republicans), as you need to get deep into territory where a Senator has more to fear from a right wing primary challenge than being defeated by a Democrat.  For those Republicans to turn on Trump you really need the party as a whole to turn on Trump, and that would only happen if the republican voter base turned on Trump, in which case you wouldn't need 20 Republicans because you'd get almost all of them."
NoStupidQuestions,"Yes, and in the same vein, it could just be concern trolling."
NoStupidQuestions,"Sodium.  Unless you are vary careful with it, it will explode.  With enough sodium to make a sword that explosion would be quite large."
NoStupidQuestions,"Impeachment is not a legal proceeding.  It uses some of the trappings, but how exactly an impeachment trial goes in the Senate is completely under the purview of the senate.  The very first impeachment in US history, of US Senator William Blount, was simply ignored by the Senate (who expelled Blount under Senate rules, not an impeachment trial).  If a majority of Senators are ok with no trial, there won't be a trial, if they are ok with a simple vote given the existing information, that's ok.  It's up to what 51 Senators want.  If the Democrats convince 4 Republicans that it's best to have a full and complete trial, that is what we will see."
NoStupidQuestions,"It depends on what you mean by ""a win"".  Ethically, if you believe Trump is guilty then it's the House's job to impeach, regardless of the likelihood of conviction in the Senate.

Politically it's more nebulous.  The likely hope for the Democrats is that Republican senators will be held accountable for acquitting Trump, using their vote against them in the coming election."
NoStupidQuestions,"Some think that a failed impeachment will do the same thing for Trump that it did for Clinton, boost his approval.  But in that case Clinton was still quite popular, and impeachment was unpopular, which is not the case now.  So it remains to be seen.

Second, people naturally like to think that their side is going to win, and any news is actually good news for their side.  You see that frequently in politics."
Askpolitics,"No, there is nothing even close to allowing this in the constitution.  The 22nd amendment restricts a president to being elected twice."
Askpolitics,"It's likely that the Democrats would have been willing to impeach Trump over a number potential offenses, but they didn't control the House until after the 2018 elections.  While things like emoluments might have been flagrant violations, they hadn't caused much in the way of public outrage, so immediately impeaching him over such violations would probably have ben politically dangerous.  At that point the Mueller investigation was well underway as well.  They were likely waiting for that to finish, with the expectation there would be enough information from the finalized report to impeach trump on those grounds.   When the report came out, the lack of a clear smoking gun, and Mueller's position on obstruction (that it was for Congress to determine) didn't help.  Polling on the issue didn't help either, and the Democrats were quite concerned with this turning into a Clinton impeachment snafu.  So when the next big potential scandal came up it was a good opportunity, especially because the charge of election interference reinforced the prior Russia allegations.  

It's possible that Biden, currently the Democratic front runner, being the target was important, but I think even if it was Hillary that he was investigating (which he partially was, given his interest in Crowdstrike), they would have move forward.  They were looking for a good opportunity to impeach Trump, and only hadn't done so prior because they didn't have the ability, or were constrained by the political reality."
Askpolitics,"People seem to think if the Republicans could vote in secret then you would find 20 or more that gladly vote out Trump.  I find that extremely unlikely.  All that would do is turn trump supporters against the party as a whole, and the republicans who voted for impeachment would still have to face trump and his supporters.  As long as polling remains where it is, with Republicans heavily against impeachment, you aren’t going to find 20 Republicans to vote against trump publicly or privately."
NoStupidQuestions,"When the impeachment trial starts in the senate the senators take an oath to ""do impartial justice according to the Constitution"".  McConnell is actively coordinating with the president on strategy to have him acquitted.  This means he could not truthfully take the oath he will be making.  This is solely an ethical issue though, not a legal one, so he is unlikely to face any real problems because of this."
NoStupidQuestions,"Impeachment is a completely separate process than a criminal or civil trial.  There is no double jeopardy concerns.  Trump will undoubtedly be facing a large number of state level charges once he leaves office, but it depends on the next president if federal level charges would be filed."
NoStupidQuestions,"Likely both committed crimes.  Clinton committed perjury and Trump solicited foreign aid for an election.  One or both may have committed obstruction of justice as well.  That doesn't actually matter though, because impeachment isn't about criminal law.  The term ""high"" in high crimes in misdemeanors isn't talking about the severity of a crime, it's talking about the nature of the action.  Specifically impeachment was designed to remove federal officers that abuse their office.  It's up to Congress to decide if the actions are serious enough to require removing someone from office."
NoStupidQuestions,"His powers aren't suspended.  He remains president with all the same powers as before.  Impeachment is like a grand jury indictment, it lists the charges and states there is enough evidence for a trial.  The trial is in the senate, where he will either be acquitted (in which case nothing happens) or removed from office."
NoStupidQuestions,"We will have to see.  The impeachment of Clinton backfired on the Republicans, but Clinton was popular, and impeachment was unpopular at that time, and the opposite is true now.  I think the end result will not be much change, or a slight improvement for the Democrats (those that don't like Trump imagine him with a lawless second term).  Trump has completely polarized voters.  People either love him and support anything he does, or hate him and want him removed from office.  Those two camps aren't going to change their opinions much at this point."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's unlikely it will bolster his base, his base was already going to turn out to support him.  There hope is to influence independents, and to tie other republicans to an unpopular president Trump."
NoStupidQuestions,"There are 4 vacant seats in the House right now, so 216 is a majority if everyone votes."
AnycubicPhoton,I’ve only done one test print since and it did work.
Askpolitics,"I have a hard time imagining a scenario where a president was removed but not barred from serving, but federal judges have been."
Askpolitics,"Yes.  Even if they are removed there is a separate vote on if they can hold office again, but just impeachment doesn't impact their ability to stand for office, including the presidency."
NoStupidQuestions,"Not in an absolute sense.  You can have a generally agreed upon frame of reference though.  For example a group of people could agree to use orientation terms such that the x/y axis aligns to the solar plane with positive z being the direction where the planets travel clockwise.  In that case ""up"" or ""positive z"" would have an actual meaning."
NoStupidQuestions,"There are two different things you might be talking about here.  The wealth that the super rich already possess isn't taxed very heavily.  It could be taxed directly via a wealth tax (something Elizabeth Warren is suggesting), or via current or expanded consumption taxes (such as higher state level sales taxes, a national sales tax, or a VAT), but for the most part that wealth has already passed though an income or capital gains tax.  Secondarily there is the issue that the extremely wealthy tend to make more of their money from capital gains (tax sales, or dividends) than via salary, meaning their effective tax rate is decreased because they are paying the significantly lower capital gains tax rates compared to income tax rates.  This could be changed by making changes to the capital gains tax."
NoStupidQuestions,"Humans evolved to be persistence hunters.  It's a technique, also used by animals like african wild dogs, where a group of hunters chase prey at a slow persistent pace.  They don't try to outrun the prey, they just try to keep the prey in sight, and keep chasing it until it's exhausted and easy to overcome by a group of hunters.  Humans are, amongst all animals, one of the absolute best long distance runners.  Most animals are built to sprint, not to run a marathon.  Because of this hunting strategy we tend to be pretty lithe, focusing more on long term efficient, than bursts of speed or power.  We also tended to overcome already exhausted prey as a group, so we don't need a lot of individual strength to kill the animal."
NoStupidQuestions,"There are two steps needed to remove the president.  The first is to put together a list of things that you think the president did that were wrong (that's impeachment).  If the house of representatives agrees (by a simple majority) that there is enough evidence to suggest a trial based on that list, then they vote to impeach the president.  After that the Senate will look at the list and investigate if they think the president likely did the things listed in the impeachment, and further whether what he did was bad enough that he needs to be removed.  That's the trial part.  Because the democrats control the House the impeachment part is highly likely to succeed.  Because the republicans control the Senate, the trial part is likely to fail (Trump will be acquitted of the charges).  The end result of this will be no change to the current balance of power, but a whole lot of political talking points for both sides."
NoStupidQuestions,Nixon's library was originally a private library and was only taken over by the presidential library system later.  So someone might have to pony up the money to get the library built first.
NoStupidQuestions,"Impeachment is akin to a grand jury, it's a declaration that enough evidence exists to have a trial.  The actual trial will take place in Senate, with 2/3rds needed to convict.  Upon conviction he would be removed from office.  Given the current feeling amongst Republicans there is very little chance of Trump actually being removed from office (unless something major changed between now and the vote)."
NoStupidQuestions,"Biden.  It's not an overwhelming lead, and there is a very good chance he doesn't win.  But the most likely candidate as of right now is Biden.  He has been ahead in the national polls since before he even entered the race, and besides a brief moment when Warren hit her peak, he's outpolled all other candidates by a significant margin.

Early state loses in Iowa and NH could hurt him, but he's expected to do very well in SC and probably Nevada.  We will also have to see what happens as people drop out and their voters shift to other candidates, but he's generally acceptable to a fairly large section of the democratic voters, meaning he will do ok.  Unless the non-Biden voters coalesce around a single alternative candidate relatively early in the process (prior to Super Tuesday for sure), then he probably wins."
NoStupidQuestions,"No (most likely).  To become Vice President one must be able to fulfill the qualifications of the presidency, which a term limited ex-President would not be able to do.  Therefore they would be able to take the office of Vice President, and would never enter the order of succession.  A similar question would arise from them becoming Speaker of the House and both the president and VP resigning.  In that case, not being eligible, they would be skipped over in the order of succession  (the same a foreign born individual, or someone below the age of 35).  

Like many constitutional questions, it's not settled law, because it's never happened before.  So there is always a chance the SC would allow it under some understanding of the law, but it isn't likely.  The intent of the law was obviously to prevent Presidents from keeping power indefinitely, and such loopholes would defeat the purpose of the law."
NoStupidQuestions,"Yes.  I don't think it's a particularly large group of people, and even smaller that think that Trump is ""literally Hitler"".  But there are people who think that authoritarian tendencies that Trump exhibits, as well as his comments about immigrants, mirrors behavior that some authoritarian regimes have used to seize and hold power.  So, for example, Huckabees recent discussions about letting Trump subvert presidential term limits, and Trumps use of declarations of emergency to circumvent checks against his power.  The lack of a strong condemnation of these actions opens the way for Trump or some future leader, to follow through on these threats in a more dangerous way.  Most people would not suggest that we are on the cusp of despotic rule, but that we are seeing early signs of things that would be a preamble to a future authoritarian state, if one where to occur."

NoStupidQuestions,"It's called price discrimination.  It's the economics practice of charging different amounts for the same object/service for different people.  The reason you want to do this is because at any given price there are those that would be willing to buy but not at the current price.  Lowering the current price will attract those customers, but will make you less money on all the people that would have paid your original price.  So companies try to find ways to figure out who is willing to pay more for an item and quote them one price, and quote another lower price for those that wouldn't buy at the first price.  Since students tend to not have a lot of money, they tend to not be willing to spend as freely.   They are also a group that is relatively easy to identify without worrying about ""cheaters"" getting the lower price.

Price discrimination is also the reason that coupons are annoying to use, seniors get discounts, and airfare costs less if you stay over a Saturday night."
NoStupidQuestions,"The 2008 housing bubble was also a bubble even though it was based on a tangible asset with real values.  A bubble doesn't mean that the underlying item has no real value (beanie baby craze), it just needs for it to be significantly overvalued based on speculation of continuing growth."
NoStupidQuestions,"The constitution, in general, isn't very descriptive.  The document talks frequently in broad terms specifically because it wanted to be a guideline for a future that they couldn't predict.  When it comes to the phrase ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" this comes, like much of the US legal code, from English law going back as far as the 14th century in this case.  The word ""high"" is not an indicator of the severity of the crimes, but their nature, specially acts related to the office one holds.  So things like abuse of office where exactly the kind of issues the framers intended to be impeachable.  There is no requirement that someone break any actual legal statute for an act to be impeachable.  There is also no legal review of proper adjudication of what does or does not constitute a high crime and misdemeanor, leading some to joke that what it actually means is ""whatever the house thinks it means""."
Askpolitics,"So I took the estimated demographic changes from the texas government site [here](https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/Presentations/OSD/2019/2019_10_09_TexasBankersAssociationExecutiveStrategicPlanning.pdf), and CNN's 2016 presidential election exit polling for Texas [here](https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/texas/president).  If you assume racial turnout and voting patterns are unchanged, then demographics alone won't cause Texas to vote Democrat for president until 2035.  For it to sale blue (5% greater Democratic vote) happens in 2045.  That's far enough in the future that other demographic shifts, along with changes in the parties, will make the electoral math quite different than it is today."
NoStupidQuestions,"There is a difference between who pays a tax (who the tax is levied against), and who remits a tax (physically transfers the money to the government).  Amazon doesn't pay a sales tax, you do, amazon just remits the tax to the states in question.  

When people are talking Amazon not paying any taxes, what they are talking about is the corporate tax.  That's the tax levied against corporations against the profits they make.  Amazon tends to have a lot of expenses, and their profit margins tend to be low, so they don't actually declare to much in the way of profits.  Additionally corporations are allowed to carry forward some of their loses.  What that means if they lose $100M one year, and gain $100M the next, they can offset that second year's profits because in actuality they didn't really make any money in the last two years.  Regular people can do the same thing (specifically with things like capital gains), but it occurs much less frequently with people than it does with corporations."
NoStupidQuestions,"I'm not sure about modern white supremacists, but that was well understood by the proponents of Nazi racial theory.  They believe the Aryan invaders were Germanic in origin.  It was part of their foundational myths that these Aryans were a genetically superior race, but that they were corrupted by interbreeding with inferior local peoples.  The felt that the nordic traits of some germans where the most authentically Aryan, and tried to specifically breed towards those traits, while at the same time removing (by isolation, sterilization, or execution) those with inferior traits."
NoStupidQuestions,"The New Testament isn't big into the blood and guts approach that is common in the Hebrew Bible, but there is still a pretty clear message to take the gospel to the whole world.

Askpolitics,"To ""go blue"" instead of just being purple, you are going to need a shift to 15-20 points towards the Democrats.  How is demographic changes going to deliver that in 5 years?"
Askpolitics,"There isn't much to be done about it.  You would need a constitutional amendment to make a big structural change to the Senate, which requires 3/4ths of the states to agree to it.  I can't conceive of a time when enough of the small states would voluntarily concede what power they actually do have in the Senate.  That would only happen if you started to see radical changes, such as the larger states breaking themselves up to get more Senate seats, and that seems extremely doubtful."
Askpolitics,"I would be extremely skeptical of Texas ""going blue"" in 2024 or 2028.  If you look at the partisan index (texas vote differential compared to national differential) for Texas presidential voting, between 2012 (11.93%) and 2016 (11.09%) we don't see large voting differences.  Sure, it's lower than when favored son George W Bush was on the ballot (21.8 and 20.47) it's actually more red now than in the late 80's and 90's (4.8%, 9.08%, and 13.43%).  So if Texas is about as Red as it was 30 years ago, are we actually seeing demographic changes effect national voting patterns?"

NoStupidQuestions,"The direct distance between the two cities is 3308.401 miles.  So your absolute shortest time is 47.26 hours of drive time.  If you stop for 15 minutes every 5 hours or so (350 miles) to gas up and recuperate, you add 2 hours and 15 minutes to the trip.  Given that you are now over two full days of travel you are going to want to stop and spend the night at some point along the ""bridge"".  So add 8 hours downtime for two different rest stops and you are up to 65.5 hours travel time."
NoStupidQuestions,"There was quite a lack of understanding, both at the time of it's writing, and after, as to what constitutes a ""direct tax"".  The founders were very worried about abusive tax policy (which is what lead to the disastrous lack of tax powers in that Articles of Confederation), which makes sense given that a large part of the rebellion as about tax policy.  As such, I think they are just trying to be very clear to try to limit tax policy, without completely starving the federal government from necessary funds to function."
NoStupidQuestions,"What it's saying is that if the federal government wants to tax the states, it must do it proportionately to the population of those states.  So twice the number of people means twice the price.  This is often called a ""head tax"" (as in, each person is counted and pays the same amount), and was very popular historically as a means of taxation."
NoStupidQuestions,"Spears and javelins are pretty short range weapons.  The world record for javelin throws in the olympics is just over 100m, and that's obviously a pretty idealized max distance.  English archers would train out to twice that distance, and could fire out to around 300m at the extremes.  The arrow would have more need to stabilize given the long flight time of the arrows."
NoStupidQuestions,It’s part of the punishment of the trial.
NoStupidQuestions,"Not in a meaningful way.  You are talking about a tiny portion of the human population, so it's not changing the balance of any given allele (version of a gene).  Further, we are making a large presumption on the general fitness of an individual based on a single foolish mistake.  Additionally, plenty of genetic traits are both positive and negative depending on the situation.  There really isn't that much difference between bravery and recklessness, so what might make someone a hero in some situations, might make then a fool in others."
NoStupidQuestions,"Casinos do have some control over the payout ranges, within an accepted band (in Nevada slots have to pay out at least 75%).  Casinos are playing a game of setting the odds of winning low enough for them to make the most money, while setting them high enough that people keep playing the game.  It would make some sense to adjust odds based on time of day, akin to a happy hour, to draw people to the games at times when they would otherwise not be busy.  But, that only makes sense if they were advertising that fact.  Just giving away more money without drawing additional players is a losing proposition.

End of the day, it doesn't actually matter.  Every single slot bet is a losing bet in the long run.  If you want to burn through some money to have to some fun, sure it's a good way to play and maybe win, but it's never a good way to make money.  The only ways for players to make money in a casino, over the long run, is to be very good at poker (because you take money from the other players, not the casino), or to count cards at black jack (which isn't illegal, but will generally get you escorted out)."
NoStupidQuestions,"To the best we can tell, it's more that the British had American accents.  Linguists think that the British accents that we now see didn't develop in England until after the Revolutionary war, and American English hasn't changed very much since that time.  So the way American's speak today is fairly close to what the British would have soured like in the late 18th century."
NoStupidQuestions,"The radius of the earth is 6300 km, while the atmosphere of earth is around 100km.  So earth is a mostly rocky planet with a slim gas layer on top.

The worst start to still make the playoffs were the 2018-19 Blues with 26 points (tied with the 2007-08 Caps), and the team to blow the best start was....the 2017-18 Blues with 44 points.

NoStupidQuestions,"Run away and hide.  You wouldn't try to fight a tank with medieval weapons.  If for some reason you were forced to fight a tank with a medieval army, and they were aware of how tanks worked, then you would want to sneak up close to the tank, take heavy hammers and attack the relatively weak sensors on the outside of the tank, which would hinder it's ability to see people.  Then go after things like the hinges of entry doors, to try to gain entry, but I'm not sure that would work, even with a lot of time."
NoStupidQuestions,"A tax deduction lowers the amount of money that is taxed.  But if your tax rate is 30% then you only would have payed $900 in taxes (30% of $3000) on that money.  So you lose $3000, and you save $900 on your taxes, so you are still down $2100.

As pirate said, a tax credit would actually decrease the taxes you pay, not the amount of money that is taxes.  Which means a $3000 tax credit would be like you are describing, but you don't get a tax credit for investment loses, you get a tax deduction."
NoStupidQuestions,"An impeachment is like a trail, but it isn't a legal trial.  Further, the constitution gives the Senate the ability to determine how it runs itself, both in general, and specifically with respect to impeachment hearings.  While coordinating with the president on his own impeachment is unethical (they take an oath to be impartial in impeachment proceedings) it's not illegal at all.  If the people don't like it they can either vote McConnell out (if they live in KY), or vote Republicans out to punish him."

On top of this there is almost no chance that trump gets impeached by hidden vote if he wouldn’t by public vote.  If trump is removed republicans as a party will suffer the wrath of trump voters, regardless of the individual votes those Republicans made."
AnycubicPhoton,I cleaned the hell out of the vat and releveled.  First test print seems to be going well so we will see.
NoStupidQuestions,For nudity to not be pornographic it needs to have non-prurient purpose.  It means the nudity needs to accomplish something other than just being titillating.
NoStupidQuestions,It's craps.  People play it as a street game as well.
NoStupidQuestions,"Not without a series of repeaters.  Network cables have relatively short distances that they are certified to work under, after that interference makes communication unreliable.  For Cat-6 cables that distance is 55 meters."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's on extremely firm ground.  There is pretty much no chance that evolution, as a general concept in it's modern form, will be found out to be incorrect.  We understand it, both in theory and practice, and modern genetics has given us a giant double check (the dual nested hierarchy) to make sure we aren't fooling ourselves.  We can debate things like gradualism versus punctuated equilibrium, but it's all within an evolutionary framework.

It's similar (and possibly on firmer ground) to things like gravity.  Physicists will tell you that current we we understand gravity is at odds with quantum physics, and we are going to need to change our understanding of one or there other (probably gravity).  That doesn't mean gravity is ""wrong"" or that gravity doesn't occur.  It simply means the way we understand HOW it works might change.  

Things could change the way we understand how evolution works, but won't change our belief that evolution occurs."
AnycubicPhoton,Is that something I should do from time to time just as a matter of course?  I haven't re-leveled since the first time I leveled.
NoStupidQuestions,"No.  Because the price of stocks tends to go up over time because companies grow and become more efficient.  Even in the absence of growth the stocks can distribute wealth in the form of dividend payments taken from the profits of those businesses.  A diversified stock portfolio will almost always make money over the long term because of this, even if no one else loses money in the process."
NoStupidQuestions,"Before taxes, your taxes are effected by a lot of things other than just your salary (charitable giving, joint filing with a partner, capital gains) that make the post tax value not representative of your salary."
NoStupidQuestions,"There are established ways to easily solve a rubik's cube.  If you learn them you will be able to solve them pretty easily.  If you practice a lot you will also be able to solve them quickly.  At that point though, it's a bit like knowing how the magician does his tricks and loses it luster."
NoStupidQuestions,"Beer is high in calories, so it's not great for most people in the long run."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's long been a part of hockey, and both the players and the fans want it to be a party of hockey, so it remains in the game.  Some people think it adds to accountability, protecting players from dangerous conduct because of immediate retaliation.  Others just like to see people fight."
NoStupidQuestions,"Smooth is usually used for long-aged whiskeys that have mellowed out the sharpness of the alcohol by being barrel aged.  I'm not sure people would consider other mechanisms of cover the alcohol (herbaceousness of gin, or sweetness in a liqueur) as smooth."
