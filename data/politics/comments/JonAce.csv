nyc,"Nice to see Q and his (probable) alts are gone. I can finally resub.

A few suggestions:

* It's possible to require an account age and/or karma minimum for comments/submissions through the use of AutoMod. It really comes down how open the team wants the subreddit to be, so I won't suggest parameters here.

* AutoMod could be used to easily combat racism/hate speech. Basically, drop a condition with some regex for slurs in there, set it to remove comments with them in it, and it should all be good.

* Nuke this rule: ""If you're rude, you better be twice as funny."" It runs counter to ""Be nice, be funny, be informative."" My assumption is that the sidebar will be redone at some point. If I'm right, ignore this as the rules will probably be rewritten anyway.

* With regards to banning, I suggest giving second (or third) chances. In my experience, most people don't break the rules twice unless they legitimately want to be banned permanently.

* Implement Crowd Control. That's it. That's the suggestion."

>As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism.

halo,"**Input Latency**

* What kind of input challenges are you having in MCC?  General input latency? Something specific to the keyboard or mouse? Please describe your issue in detail.

It feels as though I'm fighting my mouse. Either there's acceleration (with the setting off) or none when an opponent is very close. In general, there's some sort of inconsistency happening and I'm unsure if what I'm dealing with is input lag, acceleration, or both. In turn, tracking enemies is notably harder than I expect.

**I DO NOT have this issue when playing the campaign.**

* Has changing any of your MCC settings or mouse DPI helped with the issue? If so, how?

I went from v-sync off to v-sync on with no difference in how aiming felt.

**MCC Questions**

* What type of mouse and keyboard do you use?       (manufacturer and model number)

Keyboard: HyperX Alloy Elite (HX-KB2BR1-US)

Mouse: Logitech G403

* What do you set your mouse DPI to?

800 DPI

* Do you use additional mouse or keyboard software outside of MCC (such as Razer Synapse) If so, what software? What settings do you configure there?

Logitech Gaming Software; the only two settings adjusted is that there is a button assigned to switch between 2000 and 800 DPI (which I don't use during gameplay) and I have the polling rate set to 1000/sec.

* Can you summarize your MCC control settings sensitivity, acceleration, mouse smoothing, etc. (keybinds not needed)? 

Sensitivity is set to 1 for both hipfire and zoom sens. Acceleration off. Mouse smoothing off.

* Do you have uncapped framerate enabled? 

Yes

* If you played with uncapped framerate enabled, have you tried playing with it off? Did it make a difference in input latency or mouse issues?

EDIT: Tried playing with this off plus following the instructions by STRYKNG [here](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/forums/f3681fbc78fa43878c4aec9a63a46224/topics/mouse-issues-unless-making-specific-changes/1febd88a-4ecb-41ea-a41b-3affdd1663eb/posts) seems to have helped. **I noticed that the LookAcceleration settings in my GameUserSettings.ini file were all set to 4. Is this normal?**

**Other PC Game Questions**

* Can you give an example of a PC game you feel has great mouse and keyboard input response times?

Fallout 4, despite it having its own mouse acceleration issues, doesn't not suffer from what I'm feeling here.

* For that particular game, can you please list out the controls settings you configure (keybindings not needed)

I configure my settings to have a consistent 17""/360 across all FPS games.

* What do you set your mouse DPI to when playing that game?

800 DPI"

I made sure to **read all of the answers I wasn't confident in as well as the ones I got completely wrong after each quiz**. I started taking notes and making cards for Anki (see below) once I started seeing my weakest areas (based on average and lack of consistency). By the last round of MCQ, I was drilling down to the weakest *subunits* of each unit.

I also did one round of SIMs for each unit at least once.

Honestly, searching for mentions about mods is a good way to get feedback from the users who don't modmail us with it and would rather do it publicly. 

If a mod removes comments that are non-rule breaking (especially comments that contain reasonable concerns regarding the running of the subreddit), it's grounds for 1) admonishment (and potential loss of mod permissions) and 2) de-modding, if it continues. Personally, I haven't seen any comment removals (we run spot checks every so often) that rise to this level.

CPA,"I'm starting my review of REG this week and I'm trying to tackle basis again myself. 
Here's what I think I've gotten:

Net book value is basis; the original **cost** of the property less depreciation.

Debt that is assumed by the corporation is **a relief of liability/debt** and reduces basis (the tax that would have been due on this relief of debt is captured as a decrease in overall COST of the shares and is recognized once the shares are sold).

Cash given to a corporation increases basis because it increases the overall COST of the shares (you attribute the money given to the corporation as part of the purchase of shares).

Cash received (boot) reduces basis because it decreases the overall COST of the shares.

Gain recognized on an exchange is effectively taxed now (during the exchange) rather than later (on the sale of the share), so it decreases the overall COST of the shares (if the gain recognized *wasn't* included in the cost, you'd be taxed twice; once on the gain recognized during the exchange and again on the sale of the shares).

---

As for like-kind exchanges, I memorized them as Section 1031 aka ""real-for-real"" exchanges (real property for real property).  When I studied tax differences for FAR, I was told that the IRS looks at the ability to pay. In the case of like-kind exchanges, you received no cash during the exchange and therefore there is no change in your ability to pay; no gain or loss to recognize.

I haven't reviewed partnerships again yet, so I can't really give much help here yet."

I'm planing to drill MCQ and a few SIMS for at least 3 weeks, maybe 4, depending on how many weak areas I have. I'm using Gleim.

I suggest using your score report to see where you were weakest as well. In my case, I was comparable in MCQ, but weaker on the SIMS, so I know I should do a few more SIMs than I normally would while I study for my retake. I'll also drill it into my head to **use the authoritative literature during the SIM testlets.**

Lastly,[ this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPA/comments/bt4682/last_2_weeks_before_aud_exam/eoui63a/) about studying for AUD is helpful too."
