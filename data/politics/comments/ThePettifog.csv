Man, like, every day it's a murder for the right-wing. Why should anyone ""beware"" of antifa, when right-wing seems to be killing people nearly daily? That should be the primary concern. Like the FBI said, on par with ISIS. 

To your democrat state/city comments. Let me break this down. People live in cities. There is also higher demand to live in said cities. Republicans can't win in cities. They have no interest in addressing problems of cities, and people don't vote for them. That's why major cities in red states, Texas, Arizona, and Florida are nearly all blue. Because they voted the Republicans out. That's why there are [fewer and fewer Republican](https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-urban-republican-mayors.html) mayors of major cities. They don't help anything, and they're vted out. 

Now, just because people live in urban areas, and they deal with city problems, and because cities don't want Republicans, doesn't mean Democrats CAUSE or LEAD to city problems. It's like this [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1138/).  You have problems with homeless in cities because the homeless don't go hang out in prairie fields in Iowa. They don't hang out in rural areas of New York in the Catskills. They go to where there are people, services, and jobs. The city. 

You also have a lot of random assumptions about drug use and stuff. Again, the data doesn't back up what you're talking about. Look, the CDC, much more reliable than ""thefederalist"" links. 

""Rates of drug overdose deaths are rising in nonmetropolitan (rural) areas, surpassing rates in metropolitan (urban) areas, according to a new report "" - [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1019-rural-overdose-deaths.html)"
Ask_Politics,"I really didn't care about the article, because it's from a conservative tabloid in my city. But that shooting is irrelevant. Nothing points it to being an attack for political purposes. He was a troubled drugged up kid who was obsessed with mass murder who had weapons.

Even if, without evidence, you count that one guy...that still doesn't compare to the nearly 400 incidents on the right. You literally have right-wing people out murdering people, [driving cars into people](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/08/vehicle-ramming-attacks-66-us-since-may-27/5397700002/), attacking people with their [knive hands](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/driver-threatens-young-protesters-with-knives-tries-to-run-them-over-on-queens-sidewalk/2446342/).

The FBI, independent data collection, all show the right to have a violence problem. There are more than a thousand of conservative militias around the country that hate government and police. They have guns, and they plan to use them on people they disagree with. That's why the FBI, lead by Trump's appointed man, said right-wing terrorism is on par with ISIS. He didn't mention any groups on the left.

Although the parties ""switched"" over time.  You can read about that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy). Even still your red centers tend to be rural agricultural states in the midwest leaving the coasts  blue. 

Democrats over time expanded their demographics to people of color, LGBT, the college educated attracted to job opportunities in cities, etc. So Dems address concerns of urban dwellers.  Pollution, welfare, homelessness, issues related to race, student debt, etc. 

Rural areas increasingly were the constituency for Republicans.  If you consider someone who lives on a farm away from a major city center...their problems don't directly relate to urban areas. They're less directly concerned with poverty, homelessness, minimum wage, food stamps, industry pollution, they're doing their thing at home. If someone loses a job, the community and family helps. 

People in rural areas then don't see government action impacting them directly, it seems like that's a problem for other people somewhere else. And they're paying for it through taxes. Republicans seize on this in their platform with focusing on lowering taxes. Since government action doesn't directly involve them, they get a lot of their opinions about social issues based on religious perspectives which has tended right leaning in this country.

Listen, I think it’s weird that you want to talk about BLM in this instance instead of COVId....but let’s go.

First, most major cities are solidly blue. As a New Yorker, I have white coworkers who are talking about employment repercussions if they get arrested while protesting. I have another white coworker that says they set a scheduled email every night to go out in case they get arrested or hurt during protests. They come home at night and cancel it.

My friends, my coworkers, are largely out there in the protests, not worried about them. And my black friends and coworkers, are scared of getting hurt by the police if they go outside not rioters. 

So the weird part is, that if anything COVID will cause white flight from cities.  Cities are scary with covid. I live in an apartment building shared with probably 300 people. Mass transit is scary. Walking down the street is scary. We don’t have backyards to get some fresh air in. We have a lot of people and little space. 

So those who could afford it high tailed it out of here:

We have a person here, not driving under the influence because they're not driving. There is no indication that they are trying to drive. They're in a place they can safely walk home, zero percent chance of deaths (unless he trips). 

There is a decision to be made, do you show compassion for people, or do you wake up an inebriated person, fight them, and shoot them? 

There's a punitive philosophy that I believe you'd ascribe to, that thinks that cops for some reason need to be really aggressive and strict with black people in these situations. I don't hold that."
politics,"Take an even further step back. Police are supposed to be there to keep people safe. You have armed men coming to a situation where no one is unsafe, having a man saying he can walk to family members home. 

Police have a decision to make on how they are serving the community. Are they making an unnecessary arrest or helping a community member get home down the block? The man ends up shot in the  back. The police ended up with a dead body, which I think is what police are supposed to prevent.

Trumps actions from January-March 1 in particular, was lackadaisical that caused increased death. I think it was reasonable to have begun shutdowns by March 1st, but worse is that we had next to inaction instead.

Second, Trump clearly downplayed the issue by saying things were contained and would go to zero, at the same time Democrats were saying that Trump was not doing enough and was not taking it seriously (he called these criticisms a hoax). This was when people could have at least started taking minimal precautions.

Third, Trump has lied, broken promises, at every step of the way. He does not get a free pass. They did nothing from February to March when they could have been helping with supplies.

This also contributes employers to think of women as [less reliable](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/12/managers-avoid-hiring-younger-women-maternity-leave), which makes them not hire women as much. Then you can also discuss how all these perceptions about women's role in society, means perspective employers label them with characteristics that some companies think aren't suited for a CEO.

Ask_Politics,"I'm not particularly a Bernie fan, so I'm not in the tank here.

Of course older people like Biden. He's the ""safe"" choice. I also don't know if that much is depending on the white (assuming) older votes. It's about turnout of other groups who typically don't vote.

I'd argue, that the candidates that have won in recent memory have not been the safe choice.  The safe choice loses. Clinton, Clinton, Romney, McCain, John Kerry(?). The change somewhat outsider candidate typically has been doing better. , Obama, Trump...Bernie...seems to be the better trajectory for a modern age IMO.

About polls 1) You can look up polls 2) At this point in the primary, a lot of candidates who were losing polls end up winning....so it's not worth much mentioning. Biden has a strong position, but so did Clinton in '08."

It points to a lot of reports that our missile defense programs have 50-60% success rates of shooting down missiles, have been only tested in limited capacity, only a few times, in situations where we know some of the details ahead of time (they're not giving someone complete leeway to shoot a missile willy nilly). 

  
I have heard from a couple people with a military background that said, that while yes these programs and systems have disappointing success rates...but they are multi-layered so if one fails the other one can still work.

Ask_Politics,"He was not in the news constantly, and there are a few reasons why Trump gets more coverage.   


* Trump frequently says incendiary things which gets coverage. Like threatening to rain fire and fury on North Korea, creating a heated exchange that causes people to worry about nuclear war.
* Trump says silly things and uses nicknames, like covfefe and ""Rocketman"", which catches media attention.
* Trump makes innocuous lies which gets picked up, like about the birth place of his father or about [phone calls](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/02/boy-scouts-and-mexico-both-deny-claims-of-calling-trump-to-offer-praise) that didn't happen.
* Trump has been slightly outpacing Obama with the amount of [executive actions](https://apnews.com/25ca8d3b39024f9e828df7ebeb718274), when something is signed that gets coverage
* Trump's has been surrounded by people with ongoing criminal investigations, which gets covered (Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, Michael Cohen, George Papadopoulos)
* Trump has had [unprecedented](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/charts-white-house-turnover-breaking-records-n1056101) staff turn-over which gets coverage for the firing/hiring/scandal/controversy.
* Trump regularly [insults people on twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html), which also gets picked up.
* Trump has done big and controversial executive actions, which also gets picked up: the Muslim Ban, banning trans people from the military, child separation, stopping refugees from coming to the US, the shutdown, overriding congress and declaring an emergency to build the wall, cutting food stamps....(Although in a sane world would get MORE coverage).
* Independent investigations and impeachment inquiries get coverage.

When you have a ""normal"" president, who tries to appeal to all Americans, who generally avoids controversy, who acts like an adult, who isn't surrounded by criminals/crime...then the news finds other things to cover."

Ask_Politics,"Do you know what the term libertarian socialism refers to? Its not just, ""hobbling"" together two different movements or values.  Although maybe that's what you and the OP are thinking. 

Have you read the libertarian socialism wiki? Libertarian socialism has a long history, with historical figures and movements, prominent political philosophers, and active groups. 

It's not that it ""can"" exist....it does exist. It's just as much a movement as socialism and libertarianism as considered separately.  

Just because the right has tried claiming libertarianism doesn't mean left-libertarianism doesn't exist."
politics,"No we are not. That’s what you keep getting wrong about the conversation I’m having with you. 

I’m not trying to argue what I think is best for everyone. One of my original points was, what libertarians want is often juxtaposition or disagreement with what the people are fighting for,like with gay marriage. 

So I think it’s bad to claim you are a civil rights advocate, an lgbtq advocate when those in the communities disagree with you.  Sure, they could be wrong. But don’t try and raise an lgbt flag and a black lives matter sign,  if those actual people fighting the fight for themselves would fight you and your beliefs."
politics,"But the point is, you don’t fit in. Those people don’t want you. Your viewpoint doesn’t align with them. They believe (and I say rightly) that your beliefs clash with theirs.  

They disagree with your condescending  “logical sense” as illogical, and wish you would leave. Stop forcing yourself on movements that don’t want you and don’t agree with you."
politics,"You are also once again, arguing a completely different issue. I don’t care what you think the best marriage plan is. I don’t care if you think that libertarianism is the right protect  civil rights for the black community. I’m saying, your prescribed solution , is not what those people want. You can argue all day that’s what you think they SHOULD want, and is the best option, but that’s irrelevant. 

The only way you could credibly argue otherwise, is if you could show me massive participation of lgbt and black libertarians backing your viewpoints. But last I heard, they overwhelmingly support democrats.

Again, don’t make it about me. That’s an easy cop out. People in the communities don’t want what libertarians want. So stop trying to force a square peg in a round hole."
politics,"Do you seriously think you could go back in time to a gay marriage match and hold a sign that said, “no more marriage benefits!” And fit in? Do you think you could go to a black lives matter protest and hold a, “repeal the civil rights act” sign ?"
politics,"You are putting way too many judgements here. And putting words in my mouth and speculating on my beliefs. My perspective is irrelevant. What is indisputable. Is that libertarian and civil rights are incompatible and clash  with modern interpretations of civil rights movements at large.  

Civil rights movements are activist movements.  (and activism you treat derogatorily). So you are not part of those movements. Don’t pretend to be. Don’t pretend libertarians are.  It’s fine if you are not. No judgements.

My opinion, once again , is irrelevant. So stop trying to pin this on my perspective."
politics,"This is all irrelevant. I don't care about biblical law, I also don't subscribe to that view that Christians started or own marriage, but this isn't about my perspective. This is about these civil rights movements broadly. 

This is about there being a completely different mission between whatever libertarian purity standard you want to apply to the country (marriage benefits, discrimination laws, whatever) and what ""activists"" who fought for LGBT and people of color want/wanted. They are not aligned missions. You achieving your libertarian goal for marriage, doesn't achieve LGBT goals. 

I think it's scummy to try to co-opt civil rights movements when libertarians are actually more interested in their own thing. And play lip-service because it makes their movement look better."
politics,"You are not getting it...gay people want those special rights. Making your perspective on how marriage should be irrelevant to gay rights.

Making the ""libertarian perspective"" on gay rights completely irrelevant and silly. And pretending that they're ""standing up for LGBT rights"" is ludicrous. They wanted the tax refunds, they wanted the right for inheritance, they wanted to be legal guardians of adopted kids, etc etc. 

That isn't about ""understanding our legal system"". This isn't about Pepsi. This is about reality, it's about what the groups want for themselves, and advocate for. Voting Rights Act, Equal Pay Act, Civil Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act to cover transgender people, and all the laws related to discrimination AND legal codification of marriage benefits and rights. Which as you said, is fundamentally in opposition to libertarian perspective and your Pepsi. Which is fine. It's just that they/you are not an ally. You are not fighting the same fight."
politics,"I probably should have been more specific, but I was talking generally. They think the purpose of the state is to defend citizens, and that money that goes to the Pentagon is one that is seen as a legitimate use of tax funds. Generally. Do you disagree?

Ask_Politics,"This goes for most government programs and investment. Roads, parks, libraries, etc etc."
Ask_Politics,"Yes, the party of Clinton and Obama were the New Democrats of the Reagan Era.

I think most of your description above are bunk. All of these issues, don't also fit neatly on a ""more left"" line. Progressive causes tend to be incremental. Like technically, those fighting for civil rights are ""more left"" than those just fighting against slavery (and people argued just that). Yet, I would say protecting civil rights isn't ""moving left"" but a continuation of the same struggle within a modern context.

To the topic at hand. Here is my perspective on the movement of parties through recent history, which is that Republicans have been doing since Reagan, and Democrats are only now waking up to it and trying to move left to compete. I'd be happy to get into the details if you actually want to about positions over time.

1. Reagan represented one of the first ""popular"" presidents, that impacted future presidents and moved people right. This is called the [Reagan Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_Era), which ended the more liberal New Deal area, and is often seen as a shift to more a more conservative politics even including Obama.
2. Clinton was rather moderate, tough on crime, welfare work requirements. Considered a ""moderate"" [New Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats).
3. [Gingrich](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/) entered the scene, with a purposeful strategy of campaigning against bipartisanship, especially those within his party who sought it. And purposefully obstructing Clinton and making a scene for political ends.

>"" His strategy was to blow up the bipartisan coalitions that were  essential to legislating, and then seize on the resulting dysfunction to  wage a populist crusade against the institution of Congress itself. ""

4) [RINO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_In_Name_Only) became a hot topic in the 90's, which lead many Republican supporters to begin a sort of continue this purge of ""moderate"" and ""bipartisan"" members  from the ranks of Republicans moving them further to the right. This was then taken up by [Tea Party primary challengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_history_of_the_Tea_Party_movement) during Obama.  Republicans are becoming farther and farther right.

5)  You can see here that the bipartisanship, the people voting across the aisle, pretty much [dies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/23/a-stunning-visualization-of-our-divided-congress/) during this 89-95 Gingrich/Rino Era.

6) While Gingrich is off helping to kill-off non conservative Republicans through his tenure in 95 (moving the party further right), in 95 you have the founding of the [Blue Dog Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Dog_Coalition). Which are MODERATE Democrats. In finding this source for you, I've found that they've gained more power since 2012, which belies the premise a bit.

7) Obama continued this trend of being a New Democrat, which was a moderate/conservative Democrat of the Reagan Era:

>""[Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama), in a meeting with the [New Democrat Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrat_Coalition),  told them that he was a “New Democrat,” “pro-growth Democrat,” that he  “supports free and fair trade,” and was ""very concerned about a return  to protectionism.""

8) With all this in the background, you have the 2016 election. You essentially have Trump the mostly far right candidate (compared to your Jeb Bush). And then you have Hillary (your moderate candidate) vs Bernie (your socialist far-left candidate). The defeat of the moderate Democratic candidate is what has lead to your referenced ""move to the left"". So now you have liberals thinking, ""Maybe we should have gone with the far-left candidate...being moderate didn't work.""

So to me this explains the shift. Which is very recent, compared to Republican's long realignment.

From a very personal perspective, I supported Hillary because she was moderate, particularly compared to Bernie. I considered myself pragmatic. Hillary's plans on college, health care, environment, seemed to be reachable and solid policy-wise. Bernie's were idealistic with math that didn't always add up (because it was idealistic). Yet when Democrats lost to someone who had zero policy proposals or plans, and was just all ""vision"" and no substance...it flipped a switch for me.

Republicans/conservatives will call everything socialist, no matter if ACA came from the Heritage Foundation...no matter if we compromise and get rid of the single-payer. Might as well then strive for a Medicare for All, even if we get a watered down version.  Democrat positions on environment, on taxes, on gun control, on health care....poll well...it's time to stop offering Republican-lite. Democrats have to be bold, confident in our positions, and strong in our convictions.  It's like AOC said the other day, this isn't a new territory, this isn't a new radical left, it's going back to unabashedly being the party of the New Deal and Civil Rights.  Time to end the Reagan Era."

There's very little conversation about the real cost of this stuff. "" I want this, I'll do it, and worry about the cost later"". So I'm already skeptical of a penny pinching perspective from the conservative side. I think the above are crap ideals, and would much rather invest in our people and country.

First off, we need to reverse a lot of those things above to cover more investment in people in the US on programs like these. 

Second, because presidents don't enact policy some of these are vague suggestions without a clear policy or price tags, there isn't an agreement on costs or details for things like decarbonizing the United States economy. So talking about cost is already putting the horse before the cart. 

Third, we need to make sure that we all agree with what our goals are (Environment, jobs, health care), then work with congress to put forth the ideas suggested by Bernie/Warren/experts as ways to pay and implement them.  Rather than griping before we get started."

It wasn't like I brushed past 'em like, 'I don't want to hear it.' I had time to stop like, 'You do?' You know what I mean? It's like – it was just, like, the way that I engaged the world was different.""

Sending a subpoena doesn’t take time and doesn’t mean they are “investigating”. The people that are investigating work on behalf of the executive branch. Fact."
Ask_Politics,">""...go along with the impeachment inquiry every step of the  way?""

I have heard this piece of advice given to Trump since Mueller, by Democrats and Republicans, and still today. It's one that Trump has decided that he doesn't truly want to do. It wouldn't change now. 

Look at the Mueller investigation. The campaign went from saying that no one had met with any Russian officials to, finding out about more than [100 connections to Russia officials/persons.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/20/us/politics/russia-trump-election-timeline.html) We went from Trump saying that he had no dealing with Russia, to finding out that he was still in talks about a tower in Moscow during the campaign. 

These people clearly have things to hide, clearly lie. And the minute they're found out they shift the story from *""nothing to see here""* to *""yeah but what you see here isn't a problem"" t*o *""okay if it is a problem, technically I can't be charged or held accountable for it"".* 

So going along with the impeachment, would just speed up that process at finding more bad things, and maybe one of these times he will actually be held accountable. So they are trying to stop it."
Ask_Politics,"That's pure opinion on who you think should be investigating, which is irrelevant to timing...but ok. 

Also, congress isn't the one investigating Rudy. It's federal agents. FYI."
Ask_Politics,"The last government shutdown earned Trump an approval rating under 40%. I think it was his lowest approval rating. 

So I really doubt Trump would want to redo something that made him unpopular, while impeachment polling numbers go up. 

But if he did do it, I imagine that shutting down the government for personal gain and trying to obstruct an investigation....would just be another impeachable offense and would just throw fuel on the fire."
Ask_Politics,"Trump and his people are trying to throw everything they can at the investigation.

This isn't a real concern that the Trump administration has. They're not trying to make sure that the inquiry has MORE validity. They just want to critique and undermine the investigation. If it isn't this, it will be something else. The testimonies are closed, so the Republicans will say that it should be open. If it were open, I guarantee Republicans would complain that this was all a show for the media. 

Yet, this is Pelosi's baby. She decides whether to play into whatever Trump seems to want, and what is the best course of action.  I think she's made the right call. Let the investigation results speak for themselves, and have people vote."
Ask_Politics,"I disagree with your opinions, but how do you figure that this is being dragged out? They begun scheduling witnesses even while congress wasn't in session, instead of waiting for it to start again. There has been testimony nearly each and every day, with questioning that has lasted 8 to 10 hours. So full days of work each day. The only slowdown, was to memorialize the death of Elijah Cummings.  The only thing i saw speculating that things will slow down, is BECAUSE they are talking about going public.

*"" House Democrats, once eyeing an impeachment vote by Thanksgiving, now conceded they may have to go slower as they plan public hearings to drive home their case.

politics,Trump's crime with Ukraine is interfering in a US election with the help of a foreign agent. Making it *imperative* to impeach him *before* the election he's attempting to interfere with. Whether that's now or next year is irrelevant.
Ask_Politics,"There is a general consensus, that with higher voter turn out democrats win. The people that vote republican though, are more likely to vote (white older men). Yet the demographics have been set against republicans. This is why Dems want to expand voting rights and access  and rebubs want to crack down. McConnell called having the day off for voting a power grab. It's why Dems have won the last 6 out of 7 popular votes for president.

Ask_Politics,"Why do you think there wouldn't be profit motive? Let's think about it, we already live in a world where the incentive of ""getting ahead"" is already shaky. Companies are laying people off, jobs are moving to other countries, we're being replaced by robots and AI. People also just don't work at the same place for 30 years anymore.

So to a worker who is in danger of losing their job at any moment, what is the better system to create an incentive to work for a profit?

1. A system where your job has no direct correlation to company profits (profits go to the ""capitalist""/owner)
2. A system where the profits of the company are shared with you (the worker).

Which company would you be inspired to work harder for and to create profits and success for?"
Ask_Politics,"Okay, did you understand or missed the part where there’s no data supporting either/or more tv, in person, or internet audience ? And are you still not offering any facts?

Me: Here are Nielson Ratings, audience estimates, metro ridership, CNN online rating

You: Personal insults."
Ask_Politics,"So you don't have any counter argument or data, just your feelings and a vague insult. 

But I'll take you seriously! You said misread. We'll go over the sentence, word by word, and you can tell me  what i get wrong out of ""spite and loathing"".

**""This**  *(Being Trump's inauguration)* **was the largest audience** *(That means it was a bigger audience than ever before. The ""large"" part means ""big"", the ""est"" means maximum)* **to ever** *(ever meaning, of all US inaugurations),* **period** *(A period marks the end of the sentence, so here he's trying to emphasize that his previous sentence should be able to stand on its own merits. Which is very inaccurate without qualifiers, but let's see the rest of the sentence anyway)* **""both""** *(Let's look up ""both: ""used before the first of two alternatives to emphasize that the statement being made applies to each"". Okay so this next statement BOTH things will be true simultaneously.""* **""in-person""** *(okay as I mentioned, there is zero evidence that the in-person audience was bigger, unless you want to provide other data)* **""and""** *(okay so he's about to mention the next part which according to the word ""both"" is also true at the same time)* **""around the globe.""** *(So it's a little vague, but if you're not in-person you must be watching via tv and/or internet. Nielson ratings had fewer watchers, so that doesn't work. What about internet? Well Spicer cited* [CNN's 17 million live viewers](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-inauguration-viewership/)*, the problem with that is Obama had 22 million CNN views.  There really isn't much other internet data available to be compare, making the claim a big stretch with data to back it up."".* 

So all evidence points to it not being the biggest, crowd estimates, metro rides, tv ratings, internet ratings. Anything at all. You would have to make a lot of guesses and logical leaps to say that Trump had a biggest audience by any measure at all. And that's taking the sentence word by word. And for me, as someone who appreciates fact based thinking, I think it's wrong to let your feelings away you away from the evidence. 

But please feel free to show me how I misread that sentence."
Ask_Politics,"Spicer and Trump were wrong. The media served its purpose in calling out false statements.

>""This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, ***both*** in-person and around the globe,""  - Sean Spicer

I have seen zero credible estimates that think that Trump had the largest in-person crowd.  [It was smaller](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/21/sean-spicer/trump-had-biggest-inaugural-crowd-ever-metrics-don/). That goes for the metro ridership too. So that part was a lie.

""Around the globe"" must mean TV and internet, which is difficult to quantify, but....that doesn't look promising either.

>"" According to the [preliminary data from Nielsen](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-inauguration-ratings-20170119-story.html)  for inauguration coverage, 30.6 million television viewers in the  United States watched Trump’s swearing-in, 19 percent below the audience  of 37.8 million for Obama’s 2009 inauguration.

Ask_Politics,"Russia's economy is heavily invested in oil. The oil is what gives Putin money, which gives him power over the oligarchs. They had Exxon's help to drill in the arctic to get a great payout, which was [stopped by the sanction](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-oil-sanctions-impact-on-exxon-deal-2017-7)s. It's then argued, everything that Russia has done since, has been to ease the sanctions to get oil production back up.

With no potential ease to the sanctions, an aging [oil economy,](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/checkmate-putin-falling-short-on-master-plan-for-aging-oil-economy.html)  I do believe that they're probably trying to eye new opportunities to help keep the oil money flowing.

Nothing was ever found related to.the Clinton's despite how hard people looked.

It's a technicality. If Trump was impeached over tax fraud or campaign finance violation for paying off a porn star (less so), I would also view that as a technicality.  He also repeatedly lied publically about said payments, if they magically got him to testify on that...also would consider it a technicality. 

It isnt directly related to their presidency. As opposed to Trump's current Impeachment inquiry."
Ask_Politics,"I love this topic, because it's so insane in retrospect.

Starr was investigating a land deal, which never came up with anything. Then there's a rumor going around about Lewinsky. Tripp is WIRED with conversations with Lewinsky to get her to talk about her affair with the president. Monica is threatened with [obstruction of justice](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/05/clinton.usa) if she doesn't testify against Clinton. Clinton voluntarily testifies. And then all things yous aid.

If you want to see a real witch hunt, look no further than Clinton. Investigation that was politically motivated that couldn't find evidence to substantiate it's claims, found out about an affair, threatened an innocent woman with jail time to come out against the president, and then at the end of it just charge him for lying for trying to cover up his affair.

They were grasping at straws, got excited because they found something tawdry, and found a technicality to charge him."
Ask_Politics,"The GOP after a Trump reelection, is completely different than the GOP after defeat/removal/resignation/something else.

Facing difficult demographic changes, they've resorted to gerrymandering, voter disenfranchisement, election fraud, corporate dark money, and now foreign interference.

Maybe a defeat would convince them to go back to courting independents and moderates. A win would embolden them to continue on the path of appealing to their ""base"", undermining democracy in order to stay in power, in a way that the demographics don't lend them naturally."

7. Just, personally, there are a hundred other ways I'd rather spend the money helping American citizens, improving infrastructure, and investing in our country, than wasting it abroad, and killing people. Whenever we try to develop a program to help people, I'm tired of being told we don't have enough money, and we should figure out how to pay for it, while handing out blank checks to the military with no accountability. I have a way to pay for it, stop giving away money to our military and put it towards Americans."

What I'm saying is, this is a storyline that is furthered by Fox News that aims to narrow perspectives and keep ratings high.

And it's not going to be primarily white people who get caught up in it.

&#x200B;

Can we also recognize that Jews ""broke German law""? That's not particularly a shield. Like, the problem isn't the broken law. It's a racially charged crackdown, dehumanization of people, and putting them into camps with no end-game...for a potential misdemeanor."

Now it's more than that. It's tangible. We literally have system of packed camps of undesirable foreigners, who the president calls them names and said they are dangerous, in bad living conditions, a president who has said we are rounding millions, with no indication of trial or protection of basic constitutional rights. 

You can go and see crying children, who the administration argued don't need soap or beds, in soiled underwear crying for their mother, sleeping on the floor, and go, ""Nope, sorry, you're not allowed to make any connections with our camps of demonized ""foreigners"" with Hitler's mass camps of demonized ""foreigners""...not enough work hours"".  

I don't know what you need to feel like this is historically comparable, to feel like it's appropriate, maybe you want them to clock in 5 hours of work before you compare it, maybe you want the death toll to hit 50, I don't really care. I think people should be more alarmed that this is happening, that we have concentration camps, than equiovating over the comparison.

Yet now that we are literally putting minority persons in camps, without trial or charge, camps that are already bursting at the seams, with proposed plans to start rounding up millions more (and let's just imagine how that will play out), with internal reports of 900 people crammed in a space for 100, rotten food, unusable toilets, outdoor ""pins""...and we're here equivocating over the term ""concentration camp""?

Ask_Politics,"Let's review then[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida) about the election, and what happened. As the recount was underway, there were a few things going on. 

 *""Democrats had pursued a strategy of persuading  counties to strictly enforce postmark requirements by disqualifying  illegal ballots from overseas, which were predominantly for Bush.*[*\[29\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida#cite_note-nyt-29)  *In contrast, Republicans pursued a strategy of disqualifying overseas  ballots in counties that favored Gore and pressuring elections officials  to include flawed overseas ballots in Bush counties.*[*\[27\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida#cite_note-NYT07152001-27) *""*

Basically, Democrats were trying to strictly enforce voting laws, which would have not counted predominately Bush votes. And as you can see, this was also because Republicans were also trying to suppress Gore votes. 

While Democrats had this strategy, to not count these votes that didn't follow the rules....""*Democratic vice-presidential candidate Senator* [*Joseph I. Lieberman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_I._Lieberman) *appeared on* [*Meet the Press*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press)  *and said that election officials should give the ""benefit of the doubt""  to military voters rather than disqualifying any overseas ballots that  lacked required postmarks or witness signatures.  ""*

Here you have the VP pick, undermining what the campaign and the Democrats were trying to do.  You would think the VP pick would just fall in line with the presidential candidate, party, or at least stay quiet. This is not what happened. 

Maybe Lieberman was speaking with conviction on what he believed, but he took the wind out of the recount and the campaign."

1. Nazis and the alt right, do generally support Trump. That doesn't mean all supporters are alt right.
2. His animal comments are problematic no matter how you look at them. And they are rooted in racism whether or not the people who support them are themselves racist.

Let's review, let's say he was only referring to MS13. Great, woo. He is stoking fear of immigrants by conflating MS13 and immigrants. He's not specifically saying ""MS13 are animals"" he's saying this in context of immigration. What does that mean for all the immigrants, the women, children, who are fleeing MS13 who he also wants to bar? Why is he trying to make people fearful of MS13 while immigrants [commit less crime](https://oxfordre.com/criminology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-93) than American citizens?

Let's do a comparison. ""Right wing"" generally is the source of a lot of [domestic terrorism](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/09/12/study-shows-two-thirds-us-terrorism-tied-right-wing-extremists). What if I start referring to all conservatives as violent, angry, and dangerous? That they're a group that is dangerous and should be uprooted from our political landscape. That would be wrong right? This is the same type of wrong headed comment.

I also want to point out, the animal comment isn't isolated (and what you linked references that this is the second time he's said it). It's also everything everything he's done and said since the beginning of his campaign, primary example is calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists. Calling African nations ""$hithole"" countries (or $hithouse if you prefer his explanation). He's trying to make people fear scary brown foreigners, or he himself dislikes brown foreigners. One of those two things.

Alright, you want to talk about decency. I personally think Trump uses fear of immigrants to win elections, just as Bush used fear of terrorism to win his elections. That's the typical path for Republicans, fear.

Yet, I prefer an actually decent Republican like Reagan.

""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose....

Pete has this, ""oh who's this new person!?"" vibe.  And he's been doing the rounds on interviews and talks eloquently about policy and vision which puts him into conversations. "
politics,"I'll repeat what I said, I think turning your back on beliefs make it more difficult to accomplish what you say your beliefs are. One thing I gleaned from the Bernie Sanders phenomenon in politics, is that people will support you for sticking with your beliefs, even if it's not always political expedient in the short term. And he's changed the face of the party. And I don't even particularly support the guy. 

And I find it interesting that you left off my Tina Smith comment, because I don't think you can even show there's been a trade off with Franken leaving. Al Franken leaving has done nothing to undermine the ACA or put children in cages. "
politics,"You are simultaneously saying that Democrats took the ""easy"" route, while also saying we are making things tougher on ourselves by forcing good people to resign. Those contradict one another. I think the easy route is not caring, and getting what you want politically. Which is what Republicans do.

I don't believe that abandoning our core beliefs in fighting, ""sexual assault, racism, sexism, bigotry"" in any way can ""help"" us to do something about in the future, because it sends the opposite message. It makes it seen as a cheap political tool to be used, not a deeply held belief.  And Republicans are going to do heinous stuff no matter what, so we need to make our party the best it can be. Al Franken wouldn't have had the chance to stop these things, and Tina Smith is doing fine. 

"
politics,"It doesn't exist in a vacuum. If we let bad behavior within our own party go, it supports the idea that there should be no consequence for said issue. No repercussions. That these things are not issues we care about, that we don't actually believe these things. Instead, it's just 'democrats playing politics' with their witch hunts.  That's the message that sends. Which again, I think is more damaging. "
politics,"I am proud that I belong to a party that has a core set of beliefs that are adhered to, not out of lip service, not to serve a constituency, not only when it's ""easy"", not to ""win"". But because it stems from a core set of deeply seated values which we believe should be followed in life and politics. I believe that it's actually better for the authenticity and long term prospects of the party. 

I don't find the, ""we need to give up our values to win"" to be ethical nor persuasive.  Like, I doubt ""we"" are ever going to persuade Republicans to truly care about sexual assault, or racism, or any of these things. Which doesn't mean we shouldn't either, and I believe makes it more important that we take these things seriously. 

But that's my opinion.

Ask_Politics,"Things have been going in a general positive direction for a while post-recession, and it's part of the normal economic cycle that things can't continue in that direction indefinitely. I have seen several [forecasts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-01/two-thirds-of-u-s-business-economists-see-recession-by-end-2020) warning of an upcoming recession when looking at a variety of indicators.  Maybe I'm giving the general population too much for keeping tabs on indicators and economists, yet there's good reason to think we are on the peak or starting on a downtrend. Maybe people feel that.   


And yes politics plays a part. Obama had continual growth through his presidency but that didn't stop people from calling it bad and not ""feeling"" confident in the economy. And maybe some of those same psychological or real struggles still plaque Americans from Obama until today.  For example on the ""real"" side, the cost of education, health care, childcare,  has gone up dramatically, which maybe makes people feel like they can't get ahead with middling wages. "
Ask_Politics,"We have seen so many tax cuts in our recent history, and this is very similar. It's putting money in people's hands, who will spend it, and inspire growth. I don't see the same concern there. The only difference, is that this spending  (or revenue reduction in terms of cuts) is more directly helping the poor and middle class instead of the rich.

Imagine, you give a rich person and companies a tax cut, that means your Besoz might add a few extra low wage jobs, and might buy a new yacht. Those jobs aren't necessarily good jobs, and the yacht industry maybe doesn't need more money and isn't spread around much in ""needy"" communities.

With UBI, you are putting money in the hands of people who may have a hard time paying their basic bills. So instead of money going to isolated (in terms of industry), they're supporting their local grocery store, they're paying a local daycare to watch their kids, they're also increasing demand for places like Amazon with new purchases who then also may need to hire more workers to meet demand.

By also increasing this type of spending, you may increase prices, but you will also increase demand in communities and spur competition. Maybe you had one struggling grocery store, but with more money in communities now they're doing better and seeing competition from an online grocery store which will still pressure prices down.

So I think the benefits would outweigh any rise in prices, especially with increased competition.  Yet economics is complicated and it's difficult to say for sure how it would impact everything. Yet there definitely is too much blind faith in tax cuts, and not enough about the investment in our poor and middle income communities.

I can redirect my money from a cupcake to a latte, that isn't 'always good'. It's neither good or bad. It's just moving money around.  To celebrate that, based on pure speculation, is just grasping to find a positive spin. 

If we are at peace, why is North Korea continuing its drills and nuclear program? Why are we standing down while they remain active? 

"
news,"If North Korea had stopped drills, then I would acquiesce that both sides are ""lowering aggression"".  And I would acquiesce that this was a good step in improving diplomatic relationships. Yet they have continued drills for military action toward South Korea, and we have stopped training to prepare for that eventuality. So while they are gearing up, we are winding down. That's a disadvantage.

*The joint U.S. exercises... allow officers to find weaknesses in a war plan and make adjustments...The exercises are something that doesn’t cost a great deal but that yield a substantial return in terms of training and developing relationships (with allies). In terms of deterrence with North Korea, this is one of the ways we demonstrate that we are hanging together with our allies. One of North Korea’s major objectives is splitting the alliance and getting the U.S. off the peninsula, and canceling the exercises is one stop in that direction.”*  - Bruce Bennett, senior defense researcher - Rand Corp

We are doing what North Korea wants, while not engaging with our allies. That seems scary. 

Again, this money will make no significant changes to the way the military does anything, I would bet spending will continue increasing, and stopping these exercises come with a lot of potential risks and downsides. So redirecting the money increases risk, with no provable benefit. "
news,"We are not saving money. The amount we spend on these drills will be a drop in the bucket of military spending. Our military is not in a situation where it needs to 'save money' either. They are flooded with money.  They have more money than they can spend. You're celebrating a solution to something that was never a problem. 

>""Congress was in a generous mood when it passed a spending bill last week, giving the military at minimum an additional $61 billion and boosting its overall budget to $700 billion this year. For some perspective, that $61 billion increase matches or even surpasses Russia's entire military budget each year. It's more than the Trump administration originally requested"" - [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/26/596129462/how-the-pentagon-plans-to-spend-that-extra-61-billion)

I think that's way too much money, and we should reduce it...but this isn't a meaningful step to do that. It doesn't change that we will probably give them $800 billion next year. This is cancellation, does nothing. 

North Korea is not an ally, they are not peaceful, they have not stopped producing weapons, they have not stopped having drills, they have not stopped their nuclear weapon program, they have not agreed...to anything. We are giving up strategic positioning for....what exactly? "
news,"We weren't doing these drills for fun, but to  react from a threat. From the source:

>*""While the U.S. has pulled back on its exercises, North Korea has pressed ahead with its own drills. Gen. Robert Abrams, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, recently testified that North Korea was preparing to carry out its annual winter cycle of training with 1 million troops. ""*

We held these drills to help both S. Korea and the US prepare for military actions, and to warn off N. Korea. We just left the negotiations with nothing. We will be less prepared for military actions, and easing up pressure on North Korea. That's in the article. Can you tell me the good part of this?

Ask_Politics,"The problem with the Bible, is that it can be taken to mean nearly everything. I think this is partially understood by Christians. I remember hearing pastors who would cite Greek translations of words to demonstrate a different interpretation of a verse or a story that has been commonly accepted to mean something else. 

So you have verses and stories that have different interpretations.  This is also easily demonstrated through history, as people have had dramatically different interpretations. Baptists were once commonly killed because their beliefs were considered heretical. Martin Luther was like, oh man these guys have gone too far. Now they're just considered boring Christian's. Yet it's all supposedly the same Bible and same God.

More recent history, the Bible bad been used to both support and protest slavery. It's been used to both control women, and to give them more rights. 

What I'm saying is, the Bible is largely up to interpretation, none of which is actually objective, and when you think God backs up your interpretation....you act as if you're right about the fundamentals of life. Its self delusuon.

So yes, they believe they're fine and that the highest power in existence agrees with their personal beliefs and thoughts. "

Ask_Politics,"If anything, in our current conversations, I believe it is more understated as a science than overstated. 

I also majored in political science. I remember writing policy papers, for example about social security. It identified tangible problems, looked at trends, forecasted numbers in the future, it identified different proposed solutions, looked at different examples of these changes locally and globally, and offered a solution. That's not how we talk about politics now. 

Our coverage isn't waking up to review the nonpartisan estimates from the CBO, to evaluate policy. It's all about the feelings and talking heads. Where everything's right, and everyone thinks they're right, but they're not pointing out real data. We need to bring the science back into political discourse. "
politics,"I disagree. I think he would be dissuaded from doing awful shit because he's more easily cowed. Trump will shutdown the government to get what he wants, and no on can move him. He will tweet one day and get everyone out of Syria the next. It's this unpredictability and stubbornness which I think is the worst part of Trump, which again is not really how Pence is characterized. 

I think people could talk down Pence and get him to back down, and generally anticipate his reactions and strategies to counter act them.  That's my opinion. 
"
Ask_Politics,"Political Science is called a science, because there is some tangible measurable things there. If you wanted, you could write a paper on the history of raising or lowering taxes and then identifying different economic indicators for results. Now, that's complicated research. It's hard to isolate sometimes, but it can be and is done. Like all science, it's still open to interpretation and debate.  


 Yet the politics that you're talking about is more of the...""lowering taxes is a virtue"" level of politics. Which is a broad statement, taken to be true, without necessarily looking at data to prove itself. It's more about a value, than being analytically good or bad. It's about what the person wants the system to be (let's say in terms of taxation of the rich), which is a feeling and not particularly measurable. 

So I think there is a ""right"" in a lot of these cases, as close to being ""right"" as you can be...through research and analysis. Although when buffeted by ""principles"", and studies that can always be doubted....that can get lost. I think it would be good for everyone to remember, that there is underlying ""truth"" of political systems...public policy, economics, etc that can be analyzed and then debated on concrete information.

politics,"I think Pence is a relatively traditional conservative politician. Thus less dangerous.

I don't think we would have had the shutdown, I don't think we would be sitting here guessing on whether he would sign or not sign this bill, we wouldn't see the weird escalation and deescalation with an unstable foreign leader like with North Korea, you wouldn't see late night tweets about conspiracy theories, or calling the media enemy of the people...

Trump is a bull in a china shop. I don't think Pence has that temperament. He could be pushed a little bit more. And I think he could read the political tea leaves better.

* There used to be liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. Yet both parties have [voted them out](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/us/politics/pool-of-moderates-in-congress-is-shrinking.html).

I would argue yes things have been polarized, but they have been increasing. Now the Gingrich style politics is everything. There are few left in DC to reach across the aisle.

You mean the deal that Trump's Intelligence Agencies just confirmed that [Iran is holding to](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/kim-jong-trump.html), that was agreed upon by a coalition of allied countries? We don't even know what Trump promised North Korea, no one in the world knows if there is a real deal, but those agencies said it is not working.  That's all besides the point. I will answer the answer you said but didn't come out and say: ""No, Obama did not meet secretly with Muslim leaders without staff present"". "
Ask_Politics,"If this was a one-off, I could see your point. But this has been the consistent procedure for Trump's meetings with Putin.

You would think that if you were accused of potential conspiracy with Russia, regarding influencing the elections, and being compromised by having a secret deal, and being involved with multiple lies regarding meeting with Russians, while there is an investigation about Russian influence...you think Trump would be smart enough to provide the bare minimum of transparency.  Instead it was unprecedented secrecy.

&#x200B;

In your theory that this was super casual, that no matters of state were discussed? Nothing about Syria, trade, the Russian investigation were discussed in this meeting? I wonder what they talked about that they have in common. A love of tall buildings? 

&#x200B;

Also, did Obama meet with a foreign Muslim leader without staff present to fulfill your parallel?"
Ask_Politics,"That is a purposefully reductive statement. To have a meeting without any staff present is entirely and completely without precident. 

Meetings between officials tend to be matters of state, which government officials need to know. Things can be classified, but staff is always present. 

Also these conversations are typically  seen as historical and are also recorded for posterity, 

Also, Putin did have a note taker. Russia knows what was said. We are at a strategic disadvantage for our country to be blind about these discussions.

Russia, undoubtedly, confirmed by multiple agencies, attempted to interfere with our elections, and in the most recent report from intelligence agencies, already has the capability of turn off power in the United States.

Ask_Politics,"I generally agree, but was trying not to go too far down that rabbit hole. Yet challenging a ""lowly house member"" with a lack of political experience while the executive branch is headed by someone without political experience was too much to ignore. "
Ask_Politics,"I will go ahead and get this out of the way, Trump had zero political experience and he is the president. Now that that's out of the way....

Let's talk about the House a bit. The House is relatively huge. This isn't the Senate where you have a lot more clout since you are one of two representatives.  Instead, each district, which is relatively small, votes for a person to represent them in the House. One of many people who represent the state. I think if you consider what options there are to begin your political career, the House is a better fit with a lower bar than the Senate (or...the presidency). And the citizens from the district have chosen their rep.

Now, I would also challenge your premise that AOC is somehow an outlier in terms of experience in the house. She just is getting more attention. There are 18 people in the House without college degrees, 22 farmers, 8 social workers,  6 radio talk show hosts, 7 engineers, [etc etc](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44762.pdf). Meaning, that the path to the House hasn't been and isn't necessarily past political work.

Finally, there is also a perspective that has long existed in US history that we need fewer politicians and more ""regular"" people in positions of power. You can see this concept in the classic, ""[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington)"". It's the idea that, your regular citizen who is going through the average life, has a better understanding of how to represent the common american. It's not the out of touch politician sitting in DC.

If I have concerns about Suadi Arabia human rights abuses, I'm not being anti-muslim. If I criticize their war in Yemen and how people are suffering, I am not ignoring the Saudi Arabians that may be killed by Yemeni, but criticizing what I see as unnecessary violence against a people which I think Saudi Arabia is responsible for. Even if they may think it's in their best interest. Not anti-muslim.  "

Ask_Politics,"Democrats pointed out the things we agree on the other day.

>""We all agree we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values: we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings. "" - Pelosi

I would posit that even Republicans don't really believe a wall would be that effective, and have been trying to pull back the Wall rhetoric.

>""There are places where geographically, a wall would not be realistic. There are other parts of the southwest border that are so wild and untamed that there is no traffic that goes through them"" - John Kelly  
>  
>""I have concerns about spending un-offset money, which adds to the debt, period...I don't think we're just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under, around it and through it."" - Cornyn  
>  
>""If you only build a wall, only a 'wall,' without using technology, individuals, drones, observations, etc., you're not going to secure the border"" McCain RIP

I would actually say that there is a fair agreement, that an expansive wall along the border is expensive, inadvisable, and wouldn't address the bulk of the problem. There's a reason that the Senate passed a no wall budget continuation in December, and why Republicans didn't fund it while they had majorities in both houses.

Trump's tactics on this, doesn't allow much of a conversation because he's focused on this one thing. Which means it's ultimately coming down to political wins. Do the Republicans allow the President to seem defeated on something he's putting a stamp on, even if it's not the a particularly effective proposal?"

Trumps strategy in Syria, and his overall foreign policy, is all over the map. It's erratic, and in my opinion dangerous.

I'm not particularly for the military action, but I am for having a plan and executing a plan. Oscillating between threatening to pull out, ordering more air strikes, and suddenly pulling out with apparently nothing to show for it, seems sloppy. This hasn’t been diplomacy. There have been no deals made. The experts advising Trump seem to disagree with this. And the repercussions globally are something to consider. 

Congress being weak and giving all military action pretty much a pass is a whole other issue.

Ask_Politics,"My experience in farming, was that the farmer had probably two crops they focused on. They would rotate those crops.  The way they were planted was scheduled so the harvest would be at different times of the year to provide longer periods of work and sales.

If you have two primary crops, you would need a new crop if you are rotating. Adding a new crop means, determining another option that works on that land and learning how to grow a different thing. 

Each crop had significant cost associated with it. Special equipment to plant, harvest, and to store.  So just changing it up would be associated with heavy investment in equipment, while neglecting other equipment. 

The local economy also plays a part in terms of that infrastructure. For example, do you have a grain elevator that would buy, sell, and or store the right crop? 

All in all, just ""growing something else"" is more difficult than you make it out to be. "

Then you leave home and go to a new college town (maybe), and suddenly you are completely unmoored by past community perspectives. Your ""self"" is even less grounded to your community, and you can be and consider whatever you want. As you learn more about the outside world, you may have a less conservative worldview.\* \*\* If you never left home, this may not happen and you will continue living in that small circle. 

Also, I think that students with massive debt have a legitimate perspective of our system especially compared those who have thrived/survived in a different generation.

politics,"My argument is Republicans never even try to have an economic theory that is realistic that would lower the deficit or debt. Republicans often make fun of tax and spend Democrats, but that's inherently a more sound position. So I don't think they're both irresponsible. One at least tries to be responsible. 

I disagree with you. You at least need the option to raise taxes. To just randomly eliminate a way to adjust your budget, is like getting into a first fight with a hand tied behind your back. You don't have all the tools necessary to do the job that Republicans claim is so important. 

The 90's were great when there was an economic boom (and..higher taxes). It gave us a surplus (And again, Democrats wanted to save money and [lower the deficit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/06/08/gore-to-propose-medicare-lockbox/bd97ce9d-93e8-4b3c-8cda-03486b330593/?utm_term=.e810e319e1ff), Republicans wanted to give away the money. Irresponsible.)

Either way, I don't think you should spend all your money hoping that you'll get a windfall down the road that will make up for it. That's gambling (and irresponsible). "
politics,"Yet the point is, they are _always_ fiscally irresponsible. They are not responsible when they're in power, they refuse to increase revenue and always increase spending.  They ALSO prevent Democrats from being responsible when they're in power. Their existence in politics is a detriment to sound fiscal policy. 

Republicans ignore CBO scores for their policies which say will increase deficits. Attack Dem scores that say they will reduce deficits. Nearly every step they take is irresponsible. 

(Edit addition) Republicans also start out at a disadvantage, since so many of them have sworn never to increase taxes...making it nearly impossible for them to actually be fiscally responsible before they even begin.  "

3) You think it's fake. Yet there's plenty of [evidence](https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism) that it's a real issue, which instead of just thinking you know everything, you could talk about.

I see coverage of rising sales and angry conservatives. Maybe you hear something different in your closed off sphere. 

6) First racism exists, and part of the issue is racism. In studies, cops shoot black people faster. There are also more conflict between black people and police officers due to the implementation of the racist war on drugs. Which is why the classic example of white people smoking weed, but black people getting arrested for it. And the disparity in sentencing for cocaine versus crack. There's million little examples of it. I mean, we can go on forever and all the factors here.
