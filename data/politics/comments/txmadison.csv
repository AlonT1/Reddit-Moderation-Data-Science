politics,"Howdy,  
  
You shouldn't have been banned for that phrase. Obviously the ban has expired at this point, but I'll remove it from your 'history' so it doesn't count against you in the future.  
  
I am not sure if you modmailed in about the issue, but if you did and didn't get a response - I apologize, it happened during a very busy period and while that shouldn't excuse us from making mistakes, it's the truth."
politics,"As the other user replied earlier, they are spot on.  
  
You can wish someone be held accountable, or punished to the fullest extent of the law.
  
You cannot in any way advocate, celebrate, suggest, express extreme indifference, wish, hope, etc. for the death or harm of any person by any means or for any reason in this subreddit."
politics,"Our rules don't have exceptions for legal punishments. This isn't a courtroom, it's a political forum and there is no place for that here.

politics,">Do banned domains get reviewed after a particular time frame?    
  
Not specifically, there isn't a ""review banned domains every 30 days"" policy or anything similar. We do occasionally discuss them if there's free time to do so, but obviously that is contingent on things being calm for a bit.  
  
>Do permabanned accounts ever get un-banned?  
  
With *very rare exception* we allow appeals to all permanent bans 3 months from the date of the ban."
politics,"Besides using the normal moderating tools that are available (things like snoo notes, and toolbox), we have a menagerie of custom bots already.

I'm trying to help you not get banned, this is your only warning."

BlackPeopleTwitter,"In the U.S., that's the minimum you're allowed to pay ""tipped workers"". Once you total up your tips for a work period (pay period/check period - 2 weeks typically), if your 2.13/hr + (your tips/number of hours of worked) is less than 7.25 (minimum wage) then the company has to up the 2.13 to whatever is necessary for your pay to work out to 7.25 an hour, but if you get enough tips to make up the difference on  your own - they don't.  
  
Sonic is saying they won't pay out of pocket, so if you can't make up the gap with tips, they'll just let you go.  
  
Sucks right? Tipped workers shouldn't be a thing."

Yeah we're not doing that.   
  
Have a great day!"

>r/Politics is the subreddit for articles, videos, sound clips, and polls that are **directly related to** or have a **significant involvement/impact on**:

 * The running of US governments, courts, public services, legislation, and policy-making
 * Elections and candidacies 
 * Political movements/demonstrations discussed explicitly in connection with advocacy for specific policies or political candidates        
 * Lobbying and funding, groups, and donors
 * Opinion and analysis articles that explicitly and significantly discuss the above

>_All submissions to /r/politics need to, at a minimum, include a significant internal discussion or focus about **current US politics as defined (but not strictly limited to) the above**._

While the 8:46 'special' or whatever the correct word is is great, and moving - it is not about US politics as defined in this subreddit's on-topic rules."

Again, this is literally just capitalism - every business you deal with does this."
worldnews,">They are causing supply to be lowered, had they not done that, prices would be regular.  
  
You are describing capitalism buddy. This is how people, and companies, manipulate markets. Look at what all the oil producing countries are doing right now because of the global demand dropping for oil, the prices crashed, but those guys want to make money, so they are agreeing to make less oil. Making less oil available to purchase makes oil cost more again, bam, prices go back up.
  
Same thing, you want to make more money from selling switches? You buy all the ones at MSRP, and sell them for higher than MSRP. People who want them will pay more than MSRP, and now you made money.  
  
You may not like it, but it's not scalping, it's not price gouging, it's not illegal, it's literally how capitalism works. This is what every single store you shop at does. Buys something for one price, and sells it for a higher price. Whether it's Nintendo switches, or carrots, or cars.  
  
If you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at Nintendo, who controls how many are available at any time."
worldnews,"You can't price gouge on a switch, price gouging is referring to jacking up the price of essentials, video game consoles are luxury items. That's just plain ol' capitalism and supply and demand."

So I went with the 17"" MR503s. Stock tires were 245/40/R18, new tires on new wheels are 245/45/R17. Overall diameter stayed identical so no issues with speedo or anything, and it did (ever so slightly, but noticeably) improve the situation with shitty roads."
