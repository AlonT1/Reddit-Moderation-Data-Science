politics,"Again, the broader the injury is, the less likely the plaintiff will satisfy standing. This isn't a difference of opinion between liberal and conservative justices - hell, conservative ones are generally less likely to support deferential standing. Otherwise, people could pretty much sue for anything."
politics,"How are the injuries specific to an actual state as opposed to a group of voters? The analysis on standing is focused on that, otherwise all Texas suing these states is doing as opposed to a bunch of voters doing it is getting the case closer to getting dismissed by SCOTUS, which is likely the case."
politics,"If the argument Texas is making is that their voters as well as everyone else's are being harmed by weakened ballot safeguards, you've just described a generalized injury that specifically _doesn't_ give rise to injury-in-fact for purposes of standing. How do you distinguish between what Texas' standing argument is versus if a handful of Californian voters tried to sue to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania? If this were a meritorious claim, citizens would've advanced it already and it would've likely reached SCOTUS already."
politics,"1. What part of the constitution or constitutional doctrine prevents states from changing election laws before the election? Pennsylvania changed its laws last year, before the presidential primaries - this wasn't something that got done like 2 months before the election or something. 

2. What contract between the states are you asserting here? None of the claims arise out of contractual obligations that the states have towards each other. 

3. The number of states joining with amici is irrelevant for bolstering standing. If anything, the fact that there are so many states joining lends credence to the idea that this is a generalized injury which specifically _doesn't_ give rise to standing.

4. If the results of the election are changed by the Supreme Court, the last thing to be worrying about is how Congress acts. There is little to nothing in the way of legal doctrine that gives them the right to do this, and there's a mootness/laches argument to the standing argument too. We knew these absentee voting systems were in place well before the election, and there was an opportunity to litigate the validity of these beforehand (hell, Trump screaming about voter fraud for months speaks to this)."
worldnews,"Many in the top 1% would just transfer their assets to a trust or just carry on with their plan to give away many of their assets when they die. It also kind of assumes the market will keep growing like this when equities are already highly overvalued and it's hard to see 20% growth with any reliability. Most years are in the 10% range at most, and there are still quite a few that are negative. It took 7 years for the S&P to recover from its peak in '07 for instance."
worldnews,"You're referring to a wealth tax instead of a gains tax if you think a 20% gain would translate to $800 billion more in revenue this year. Most people do not realize their gains every year and wealthy people definitely do not. A wealth tax would also trigger fire sales of equities that would likely impact their value if people knew that wealthy individuals had to sell off x% of their assets every year, and dividend returns frequently get ploughed back as equities to delay realization. Moreover, it's not that the wealthy own $23 trillion in equities - a large amount is held by pension funds and 401Ks that don't pay taxes on capital gain."
worldnews,"There isn't that much more money in the capital gains tax. At most it generates like $100-150B/year more if it were to match income tax brackets which can easily be dodged by not realizing gains until you have to. And at the end of the day, it's still saying that the top 1% in this country pay 40% of all income tax and 70% of all capital gains taxes."
worldnews,"No, this is actual revenue that's been paid in. I suppose this means that existing policy actually called for them to be taxed more, though you can come up with policy to close some loopholes (increasing the capital gains tax for high earners, removing step up in basis for large inheritances, etc.)."
worldnews,"They'd take their money with them. And oftentimes progressive taxation structures do already bias heavily towards taxing the wealthy. In the US, for instance, the top 1% pays nearly 40% of all income taxes, while the bottom 90% pays about 30%. Now, the wealthy often very much have the capacity to pay much more than they do already, but it's often also not this ingenious idea that populists come up with that policy people haven't seriously considered before."

politics,"The press is entitled to exercise journalistic integrity when deciding whether or not to report something as problematic as the Hunter Biden stuff. All the major networks sent their top journalists to try and verify things and not even Fox was willing to do much with it from their news side.

So many of his recent tirades have become increasingly unhinged, but he's unable to think he's capable of being wrong so he'll double or triple down on something."

Moreover, a lot of the bills are either to municipalities like El Paso, or small vendors, who are all struggling in this economy right now.

politics,"Rho Khanna literally tried to primary Mike Honda from the right in the seat he now holds (Honda later died) and would've been a textbook ""moderate"" (hell, even just 4 weeks ago, he was trying to get Pelosi to take a watered down deal from McConnell for COVID relief), but he endorsed Bernie and M4A and that's apparently all you need to be a ""progressive"" these days."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"The Republican literally got 32K votes more than Trump in that district, which is an overperformance that we didn't see in the Senate portion of the race (Lewis only got 1K more votes than Trump there). 31K Biden/Smith voters conscientiously chose to vote for a Republican in that seat because of how toxic Omar is politically."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,AOC has made completely Trumpian bad faith arguments lately like that and relied on her supporters to behave just like Trump's in mindlessly parroting what she says.
politics,"This poll had leading questions that basically led to the results. The question about Haaland (who would be an excellent Interior pick) were something about how she's one of the first Native American woman to be elected to Congress and how her career before was working with small businesses and organizing for Native groups, whereas the one for Brian Deese was about how he works for the largest investor in fossil fuels and has supported cutting Medicare. I don't know who that is, but if you lead with something like that, I'm not sure why it's at all surprising that it gets the results that it does."

Enough_Sanders_Spam,"I mean the election results kinda are self-evident in this regard. We let them gatekeep this presidential primary to literally ludicrous levels, where people were debating a false choice between eliminating all private insurance and just eliminating some of it, as if that was actually remotely possible short of 60 seats in the Senate. It honestly reminded me of the stupid false choices in the 2012 Republican primary, where the Republicans tripped over each other talking about how many departments they were going to slash (and somehow that looks moderate compared to the cost of M4A). This shit just wasn't realistic and good Congresspeople paid the price for the Twitterati Queen's purity trolling."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,Someone did this once and apparently Biden and/or HRC were just center left.
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"Jacobin probably looks for these kinds of takes deliberately. They’re one of those outlets that thinks being controversial to the point of parody is supposed to be thought provoking, which is why they also have takes about air conditioning being oppressive."
politics,"They found a few thousand ballots in a deep red county that weren't properly uploaded. Trump netted about 800 votes from this pot of ballots. These changes are normal during canvassing and recounts, but nothing on the order of magnitude of 10K votes or more has ever been found (the closest in recent history was a WI-SC race in 2011 where they found 7000 votes that hadn't been uploaded which flipped a narrow 400 vote lead for the Democrat to a substantial one for the Republican)."
politics,"It's probably also good for the Georgia senate races if Biden is telegraphing that he wouldn't direct an investigation, since otherwise the Georgia Republicans would rally on the idea that they're trying to save Trump or whatever."
politics,Yeah I don't know why people are misconstruing this. He wants the DOJ to be independent and wants to let them conduct their own investigation. Being the anti-Trump means believing in the independence of the DOJ instead of using it to try and punish your adversaries. It also doesn't matter as much since a lot of the cases are at the state level too.
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"He did better with minorities, yes, part of which can be explained by literally the entire political spectrum for certain communities voting Dem, which obviously isn’t tenable long term when the leftists in the Democratic Party keep pushing unsustainably to the left."
politics,He has literally no basis whatsoever to allege fraud. He's down by far too much for canvassing or recounts to change the outcome. The election outcome was fair and now the delay is risking the incoming administration.
politics,"If you could substantiate that claim, I'm sure the Trump campaign would love to hear from you. These individual stories come up every year and it's usually Democrats that complain about them more, so the direction of these kinds of effects is hardly in their favor. Voter suppression tactics like aggressively purging voter rolls, cutting budgets so that precincts get closed down the day of the election leaving voters scrambling to find a new place to vote, limiting early voting to one precinct per county despite Mecklenburg and Harris counties being several orders of magnitude more populated than the rural counties in their respective states....this stuff happens and has happened for decades now, and it _is_ designed to favor Republicans.

These accusations and conspiracy theories that Trump is throwing out are simply not substantiated and deliberately being pushed in flagrant bad faith in such a volume that it's not possible to effectively debunk each of them. The so-called voter dumps that all went for Biden for instance just didn't happen - I stayed up until 4AM on election night to watch the returns from Wisconsin and Trump got votes from the Milwaukee county absentees even if Biden got the lion's share. Comparing these numbers to what they were in 2016 also shows that they are broadly consistent with historical numbers so it's not like counties were rapidly shifting left or right. In fact, Biden's share of the vote AND net vote margin out of places like Philadelphia and Detroit actually declined slightly from Clinton's."
politics,"It is not common, there are isolated cases of it happening but the integrity of elections is not at stake as a result. 0.5% in the states that mattered in this election is enormous, and the level of sophistication needed to orchestrate a shift of 44K votes across 3 separate states is something that almost certainly would've been caught. It's also worth noting that Biden's gains in places like Pennsylvania and Georgia are broadly consistent - he does better percentage-wise even in rural white areas like Pennsyltucky and Northern Georgia, but Trump nets more votes. There is no consistent reason why this would be the case if the goal was to steal the election as opposed to just seeing a lot of turnout this year."
politics,"The 3 public examples of voter fraud were all Trump supporters trying to vote twice or on behalf of another person (1 in Nevada, 2 in Pennsylvania). In 2018, there was actual election fraud perpetrated to help Republicans in NC-09 when someone filled out thousands of ballots for the Republican there such that the entire bipartisan NC State Board of Elections refused to certify the election."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"This is the fundamental miscalculation that Democrats made this year, that the white savior complex that white leftists had was in any way remotely substantiated by actual sentiment within POC communities. The fact of the matter is that there is a fundamental tension between white leftists and “moderate” POC. The entire political spectrum for African Americans and most of it for Hispanics votes for Democrats - that can’t hold long term when the party is being led to the left at an untenable pace. White leftists didnt even deliver this year either - we didn’t see much increase with urban white leftists and most of the gains come from college educated whites who live in suburbs and exurbs."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"The crazy thing is that Klobuchar is not even moderate by congressional standards - she’s about the middle of the pack for Democrats and has always been a mainstream liberal by nationwide standards. But the party made the mistake of entertaining the false choice that the Berniebros thrust on it by going further and further left arguing over policies that were never going to be implementable, and the single most effective Senator in the field this year got cast as a “moderate” even though her record is undeniably progressive, and her plans undeniably realistic. The party needs to reconcile with how it let the lazy populists set the tenor of the debate this cycle, because a huge faction of the party is only Democratic because Democrats act like the adults in the room."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"Klob “only” won about 39 counties in 2018, which is down from her almost clean sweep of 85 out of the state’s 87 counties in 2012 IIRC. She puts in the work too, making sure she visits every county every year all while being a part of all of the major bills that go through the senate. I might be partial since she was my number one choice at one point during the primary, but she was probably one of the only other Democrats this year who could’ve beat Trump given how the map ended up looking like."
politics,I don't think that's possible to be honest. A lot of Trump's populism is deeply rooted in the parts that make it unpopular broadly speaking.
politics,"Democracy Institute isn't a pollster, it's so made up that even RCP won't touch them. Back when they split out crosstabs, they had Biden trailing Trump like 48-45 in the national popular vote, except their racial crosstabs had Biden winning 45% of the white vote, like 77% of the black vote, and like 55% of the Hispanic vote. 

He's also wrong about the list of cities that Biden overperformed in. Biden did better in Houston, Fort Worth (being the first Democrat to carry Tarrant County presidentially in like...decades) and Pittsburgh, and he actually underperformed Clinton in Philadelphia and Detroit unlike the claim that's being proffered."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,It baffles me how he was able to get unsuspended given how plainly inorganic his vote patterns are.
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"I strongly doubt this will happen, especially when one faction just doesn't vote as often and doesn't hold much power. A lot of this concern over splitting is understandable, but with the party out of the wilderness, it will be easier for leadership to control it and make sure there isn't a large split."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"It's kind of stupid since Medicare for All is an example of them being extremely effective at messaging by making a more radical plan seem less radical than it is. They know how to do this, they just don't care."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"At least two south Florida seats shifted because of the socialist rhetoric and can pretty much be tied to AOC and Sanders being the vector to saying the Democratic party is socialist. The Congressmen who lost didn't support Medicare for All but that's more of a survivorship bias since they're ofc from swing seats. In one swing seat where a Justice Dem/M4A type won the nomination (NE-02), she lost the race by about 5 even though Biden carried the district and its electoral vote by around 7 points."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,To be fair I've seen a few of them literally just LARP as Bernie supporters so they know the motions already.
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that the AOCs and Omars of the caucus are infinitely more easily replaceable than the Lambs and Underwoods and Slotkins. If AOC gets primaried, chances are her replacement can only be better - if Slotkin gets primaried, we're probably losing her seat. It will always be much more important to protect majority maker congresscritters than it is to appease the ones who just need to be warm bodies with Ds next to their name on the ballot to win their elections."
politics,"Biden literally described what his post-election life would look like if he lost at a town hall (going back to teaching at UPenn and working at foundations or something) and repeatedly stated he would respect the outcome of the election. I understand that Democrats raised a stink after 2016, but Clinton conceded the next morning so none of that was coming from the top."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"It doesn't seem to just be Cubans though. I was listening to the Daily and they had a listener call in who is Nicaraguan and she said that the Nicaraguan community was staunchly pro-Trump because they were largely exiles to the Sandinista government too. Florida appears to be a hot spot for exiles of socialist revolutions in Latin America, so the Bernie rhetoric hit us hard in that state this year."

Enough_Sanders_Spam,"All of this is based on their idiotic idea that, by pushing for this, they're able to have a higher bargaining point to eventually negotiate down to a public option or some weaker M4A, which is exactly what someone who has literally never negotiated something big would think is how negotiations go. In reality, their ever-expanding M4A pipe dream almost certainly torpedoed our shot at winning back the Senate and was the perfect substrate for the attacks on vulnerable Dems for being ""socialist"" in places like southern Florida."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"Well, no, her filing was last month. I think most people didn't care about it until now. She's trying to get ahead of the very clear evidence in this election that the party went too far left, which is going to sideline her and her squad before they could get to be a large enough entity to act like a leftist Tea Party."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"These are like direct mailers or something for AOC, Pelosi usually hits up a wealthy donor network, and she only raises that much money because she gives most of it to the DCCC. I agree that a lot of it being unitemized is not a meaningful issue though."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"I can’t even figure out rhyme or reason with her filings. I thought she was raising all this money so she could play kingmaker and dole out cash to people, but she only gave out $6800 to other campaigns ($2.8K to Levin, $2K apiece to Omar and Tlaib). She also burned a lot of this cash, so she wasn’t raising it for a statewide bid or something since she has $4M CoH left. Instead, the largest vendor recipient of cash was a Los Angeles based media consultant that got like millions. Feels like a grift."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,Is there a tally for other leftists? I saw the results in Omar's district and Eastman but I don't know where to find the ones for Tlaib.

For the folks whose lives and well being were actually on the line with a second Trump term, they made their voices heard loud and clear."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"What’s particularly pernicious about this is that AOC almost certainly knows this is wrong, but she’ll push it anyways to troll “moderates”, just like how she kept trolling about the Amazon HQ2 thing. It’s a downright Trumpian thing to do for her and she’s smart enough to see the parallels and go for it anyways."

Enough_Sanders_Spam,Biden becomes the leader of the party as president. That sets the tone for the Democratic party and insurgents from a president's own party generally get way more pushback than if the party is in the wilderness.
Enough_Sanders_Spam,Literally down to the victim complex.
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"Honestly, Biden wasn't my first choice by a long shot, but the results of this election made it very clear that he was pretty much the only one who could've defeated Trump. I just felt like I was taking crazy pills during the primary listening to leftist purists gatekeep further and further from reality on things and wondering how the hell the country as a whole was actually having this conversation. With Biden at the helm, I really hope the party comes back to reality about actually trying to get things done rather than trying to sound ideologically pure."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"It's starting to sound like AOC knows that leadership is going to put the screws on the Squad in the next session after their blabbering about socialism and pie-in-the-sky stuff legit hurt Dems more than it helped, so she's going on offense now to try and push back."
politics,"There's really no legal argument to get it into the courts. Trump was hoping that Biden would need late arriving mail to be able to beat Trump in places like Pennsylvania, and then getting the courts to invalidate those ballots. Those ballots are already segregated and aren't being counted, and Trump's still losing PA. The cases that they've brought up to courts so far are basically frivolous, trying to argue that being unable to fully see ballots in small counties that are red and run by Republicans means that entire vote tallies are invalid. Unsurprisingly, courts are ignoring those lawsuits and he's getting shut down."
politics,"The sophistication of a conspiracy to commit massive voter fraud in a way to actually impact the election would make it very hard to carry out in reality. That's really why the elections have been relatively safe in the US - there's just so many interested parties on both sides willing to ferret out suspicious activity and there's just such a large volume of votes that it'd be hard to hide it. The votes that came in for Biden were not very suspicious at all - the final vote in Milwaukee isn't much different from 2016, either in raw votes or margin, nor is that the case in Detroit (where Trump actually did better) or Philly. Moreover, in places like Pennsylvania and Georgia, you'd have to have Republican counties in on it too because Biden overperformed Clinton by 4 or more points in a ton of blood red counties even if they didn't hand him the win in the counties themselves. Like Biden's win in Georgia was mainly because of Atlanta, but he was improving in blood red Northern Georgia too, and how do you get enough buy-in from Republicans in an 80-20 Trump county to also rig their votes with you?"
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"Still not gonna believe in it until I see it happen, but states in the New South are basically textbook “liberal” if they end up voting for us. A coalition of college educated whites and POC is how we win these states, and Sanders got blown out of the water by these folks in the primary."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"The hypothetical blood of people who would totally have been saved by Bernie’s totally realistic healthcare plan is on the hands of everyone in the Democratic Party for not just worshipping that blowhard and handing him the nomination, so I’m guessing it must be their fault for the actual blood of all the people who died from Trump’s incompetence because they didn’t want to vote right?"
PoliticalDiscussion,"This trend has been towards early voting over the years, though since it tends to favor Democrats, Republicans have tried to stop it."
PoliticalDiscussion,"If it's Trump:

* People generally back incumbents and few of them lose reelection.

* Despite Trump getting hammered on his covid response, his approvals with the economy have remained remarkably resilient despite the recession.

* Polling shows that Trump's electoral college advantage, which was 2.5 points in 2016, had actually expanded to about 4, which is how much redder the tipping point state of Pennsylvania is compared to Biden's national leads. You wouldn't need a huge polling error to be off by that much.

* Polls this cycle and pollsters in particular that polled nationally exhibited a remarkable amount of bifurcation, with some pollsters doing well in the Rust Belt and not the Sun Belt and vice versa (eg. ABC having really good Biden numbers in the Rust Belt and not the Sun Belt and Monmouth as well, whereas Quinnipiac is a bit of the reverse). Trump overperformed the averages as a result. 

* The tighter numbers from internet polls relative to live caller polls reflected an actual shy Trump voter effect. Evidence of this shows up in the DMR final poll where 4% of the LV sample literally voted but declined to state for who.

* Trump's base never left him, and the Trump campaign's emphasis on in-person GOTV efforts and rallies helped push late deciders his way while Biden and the Dem strategy of just blasting the airwaves and holding fewer rallies was much less effective.

If it's Biden:

* Biden's polling is stable. Where Clinton regularly would see her leads shrink to nothing in 2016 or even at times have Trump leading, Biden's only trailed Trump in polls from 3 pollsters all cycle long, and the lowest he's dipped on the RCP average is a 4 point lead, which is enough to win with 280 or so EVs. 

* Biden's hitting 50 or above in polls. Many of Clinton's swing state poll leads were in the mid 40s, with Trump in the low 40s or high 30s. There was enough room for undecideds to consolidate behind Trump, which is what happened in enough states to eke out a win.

* Biden just isn't that hated. Biden didn't see a polling bump coming out of the DNC, but he saw his favorables start to rise. This just makes it less likely for Biden to suffer the problem Clinton had where people who hated both her and Trump ended up supporting Trump by double digits. Instead, Biden's the one who benefits from this pool of voters.

* There aren't that many undecideds or third party voters. This gives less room for Trump to consolidate the vote in states where Biden is under 50 by giving him less to work with.

* Incumbents with bad economies generally lose. Trump benefits from incumbency in many ways (a lot of people might just be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt or something), but the economy is bad right now and incumbents usually need a bad environment to lose.

* Biden swamped Trump's cash advantage. While Clinton had a cash advantage as well over Trump, Biden's simply dwarfs hers, as he had a nearly 3:1 advantage going into the final two weeks of the election. 

* Trump is now a known quantity and the media has learned how to deal with him this time around. In 2016, Trump was such a ratings magnet that he obtained billions in free earned media. Networks would breathlessly follow his rallies, hoping to see him say something stupid again, and there was so much exposure to him that he was able to get the media to get his message out without spending money. This time around, the media's generally been exhausted by the stupid shit he says, and fewer of his rallies are getting carried live by national networks. 

* Trump's a known quantity this time around. In 2016, Trump was the outsider who said controversial things, but after an 8 year Democratic presidency, people were willing to give him a shot as a change candidate. He doesn't have that benefit this time around, even if he acts like that. 

* Trump's coronavirus response has been a disaster. On both messaging and results, Trump's response to the pandemic was and has been the overriding concern on voter's minds this time given just how much of their lives have been disrupted by it."
PoliticalDiscussion,Assign them to the winner of the national popular vote.
PoliticalDiscussion,"It's definitely possible that they slime each other so badly that they poison the well for either of them going into the runoff. This happened recently in the LA-GOV race last year, where the Republicans got so toxic towards each other to try and get the second slot that the winning candidate saw a noticeable drop in support/turnout in the part of the state that the losing candidate, Rep. Ralph Abraham, represents in Congress. Louisiana being as close as it was, it probably made a nontrivial difference in the ultimate vote as well. Might be worth a point or two given how vitriolic it's been, and I'm also reminded of the 2006 California Democratic gubernatorial primary, where Phil Angelides and Steve Westley nuked each other so badly that, when Angelides narrowly made it to the general, Schwarzenegger literally just ran clips of some of Westley's ads back at him. It's definitely not nothing that Loeffler and Collins have bad blood."
PoliticalDiscussion,"The parties have seen a huge change in their bases since 2008. The Dem base is more reliable now since it has more college educated whites and fewer non-college educated whites. Additionally, if Trump loses, he'll still be president when the runoff happens, but it's hard to see him muster up the interest to help either candidate in the runoff. Enthusiasm might take a huge hit on the R side as a result. On the flip side, if Biden wins, there's really no reason he or Harris wouldn't want to do all they could to win the runoff for this race. 

It's also not guaranteed that Dems just won't show up. In 2018, one of the only races that made it to a runoff was the SOS race. Barrow got 48.7% of the vote in round 1 and 48.1% in the runoff, so it wasn't a collapse like Martin in 2008, even though this was a relatively obscure race that most people weren't even paying attention to. Senate race would be more high profile and, as long as it doesn't decide control of the Senate, I could see the Dem base being more fired up than the Rep base."

There’s just a special level of shitty that Republicans have always been, which is important to consider if anyone thought it started with Trump."

politics,"There's very little reason for people to lie to a pollster. The Bradley effect didn't sink Obama, and it's not the reason why the polls were wrong in 2016. ABC and other pollsters just have an issue with modeling different electorates in the country. We're increasingly seeing a split between the Rust Belt swing states and the Sun Belt ones, with pollsters generally modeling one set differently from the other. Quinnipiac, for instance, has exceptionally rosy Dem-leaning numbers in Sun Belt states, whereas Monmouth typically doesn't. ABC has these rosy outliers in Rust Belt states, whereas they are much more bearish in the Sun Belt states that they've polled."

The100,"I mean I didn't like Cadogan, but yeah, the Disciples didn't seem like inherently bad people, and Clarke had a lot of opportunities to work with them in a way that wouldn't have gotten so many people killed. It used to be that Clarke would make questionable decisions during a season that would end up being vindicated in the season finale, but ever since the Eligius ship ark, she's acted irrationally to protect Madi in ways that have not made sense after the fact. I guess those are instincts that have paid off for her in the past (not believing the Mountain Men or Octavia as Blodreina, not trusting the Primes, etc.), but it made her storyline less sympathetic. Still, the pacing in the final season felt very rushed compared to previous seasons, so I suspect that if the producers had had 2 or 3 seasons to flesh out the baddies and the final test on their terms, the Disciples might have ended up less sympathetic"
The100,"Becca presumably didn't start the test, so she could leave, but Cadogan had started it, and once he did, Clarke had to keep going after she killed him."
The100,I think they did. Clarke asked the judge why she wasn't going back to Bardo after she killed Cadogan and she said that the test had already started and couldn't end.
politics,"The only way you can _kind of_ tell is by checking where the vote is coming from, and those numbers aren't great for the GOP.

politics,">Do you think Trump sent his private delegation to WHO and China, and they report to him and only him?

What is this even supposed to mean? Trump _didn't_ send a delegation to the WHO and took our people out of China where there was an infectious disease unit to monitor for these kinds of things. So are you saying that he did that intentionally so people wouldn't ""spy"" on what they had to say, or that somehow state Governors are entitled to briefings on things like this? 

>You know what else is a federal government's job? Illegal immigration, but it doesn't stop California ignoring the federal government when it suits them.

Utterly irrelevant to the matter at hand, though something called the 10th Amendment lets the states decide whether or not to cooperate with the federal government on matters like this. That's how red states have resisted the Medicaid expansion which is the basis for a lot of the law in this area too.

>Also, Democrats never supported closing the airports, so how is that Trump's fault that he didn't do it? A Democrat president wouldn't do it either.

That did very little to stop the problem because the coronavirus that hit New York and other East Coast states came from Europe, which he didn't close until March in an utterly incompetent fashion that probably accelerated the spread of the virus. And whatever time he bought by doing this was squandered when he did fuck all in February, the test kits being wrong, the lack of preparation with the national stockpile, and his insistence on not coordinating supplies at a federal level completely and utterly undermined any capacity to efficiently manage the pandemic in a way that didn't lead to thousands of unnecessary deaths."
politics,"How was California’s Governor expected to know how bad the coronavirus would be? Was he supposed to send his own delegation to the WHO? To China? Was he supposed to monitor international travel even though he has no authority to actually do anything about it? You’re presupposing that all these governors were also told, like Trump was, on January 28th just how bad this virus was. This was and is the job of the federal government, and Trump absolutely and spectacularly failed this country."
politics,"Democratic Governors followed the advice of the federal CDC at the time. The failures at the federal level, including not even providing correct test kits at the outset, made it difficult for states to work to stop this. States aren't supposed to figure out how to deal with a pandemic on their own. It's not like New York could send a delegation to the WHO and to China on its own. The failure is squarely on Trump to prepare the country for the coronavirus, and because he spent his time golfing and shitposting on Twitter instead of doing his job."
politics,"This has come up a few times and we're certainly open to discussion, but as a guiding principle, we generally try to avoid implementing rules that have too much subjectivity involved. In the present case, are you saying we should stop allowing articles only where a celebrity is opining on a politician? If so, who are the people who we would tolerate an opinion on politics from? Everyone else? Just politicians? If it's everyone else, then how do we judge who is and isn't enough of a celebrity? If it's just politicians, how do we decide whether someone is a politician (eg. is it the standard we use for topicality, or is it a broader one that includes superPAC heads and what not?), and how do we decide if a celebrity who is also a political activist is speaking in their capacity as a celebrity vs being a political activist?

This isn't to pour cold water on the idea, but it illustrates the kinds of questions that come up whenever we change a rule. While there are invariably situations where moderators have to make a call on something that's potentially subjective, we generally try to avoid it where possible, because otherwise we're opening ourselves up to a lot of complaints in modmail and accusations of bias."
politics,"Our tolerance for bad faith comments has gone down a lot since 2016, so there may be more users being actioned for trolling. There have also been some significant changes to the sub's rules that have made it harder to troll. Users are now required to post from an approved domains list, meaning we no longer have as many blogs or glorified blogs being posted which often had controversial titles and discussion. Users are also required to use the exact title or byline of articles which, for the most part, reduces a tendency we saw with users picking unrepresentative titles to troll others. 

New users in particular are also now subject to a litany of restrictions that we did not have in 2016. There is a limitation on what sources on the approved domains list that they're allowed to post from if their account is too young. They are generally locked out of certain discussions if their account is extremely young. We also tend to issue bans more harshly against new users. All of these limitations weren't in place in 2016, but kind of constrain the supply of bad faith accounts on the sub. 

It also goes without saying that the admins have been a great help this time around with changes they've made to the site over the past 4 years. There is a lot more help for ban evasion, and there is also more activity by the admins themselves in moderating certain comments, which gives us a better guide on where the sitewide line on rules is.

That isn't to say that we can't continue to work to minimize bad faith interactions, but in general, 2020 has been a lot easier for us than 2016 was."
politics,"Looks like we did this in 2017 or 2018. There were blacklists at the time in 2016 such as for foreign propaganda sites, but those would be a lot more limited as compared to an approved domains list."
politics,"While we can't speak to the quality of the submissions themselves, to the extent that a lot of these posts were being made by users evading bans and what not, the existence of the approved domains list and other new user measures we've taken (most notably, when we limited new users to posting from wire services only) have likely made it much more difficult to continue that kind of activity over a period of time. The admins have also stepped up their game when it comes to rooting out ban evaders, so if your view is that many of these accounts are from the same handful of users, the chances they get suspended sitewide is also higher now."
politics,"It would be difficult to remove all opinion articles because politics is inherently opinion-driven, and the distinction between opinion and straight news kind of breaks down in a political sub anyways because, well, a lot of the straight news is also political opinions. 

We've explored the concept of flairing opinion articles, but there's no easy way to automate it, as every site on the approved domains list segregates their opinion articles a little differently. If we allowed users to flair their articles themselves, it raises a question of whether and how we would enforce that, and it would also get messy if users started to contest whether their flairs were accurate or not."
politics,"The argument is that Biden pressured Ukraine's Attorney General to resign so they'd stop investigating Hunter's client Burisma. From there, it opens a door to other things that Hunter did and the clients he had, which would allow Trump to run on the idea that the Bidens are as corrupt as the Clintons and therefore relitigate 2016.

It is not disputed that Biden did try to force the Ukrainian Attorney General to resign. However, this was consistent with the public positions of both the US and EU at the time, who viewed the AG as being too corrupt. Moreover, if the reason was that he wasn't hard enough on crime, it makes little sense to be sacking him if the goal was to stop him from investigating crime. 

So, basically, for this to work, Biden would've had to, as the Vice President, change US and EU foreign policy w/r/t Ukraine, and there would've needed to be an, at the time, active investigation into Hunter Biden's client (something Ukraine has repeatedly denied). It's just a bit difficult to see that conspiracy bear out."
politics,"Trump seems to overestimate how much of 2016 happened because of him as opposed to because of Clinton specifically. Hillary Clinton's presidential ambitions were, to put it mildly, fairly transparent for years, and the Republicans responded accordingly by defining her as untrustworthy and corrupt for decades. The ""crooked"" Hillary moniker Trump gave her fit this impression pretty well as a result.

Additionally, the posture of the Comey investigation was very different from anything Barr could start now. Despite the DOJ's reputation as being independent, I think most Americans come into it with the assumption that the DOJ is partisan to some extent depending on the party in power. But for the sitting President's DOJ to be investigating that President's own party's nominee, there's a stronger inclination to believe that something bad was going on. Barr investigating Biden, by contrast, really just fits an expectation that the DOJ will be partisan.

Finally, the nature of the Clinton email leak was something easily explainable and easily relatable. A lot of people have served in the military or worked in defense, so the notion that Clinton could literally mishandle classified information and _not_ be prosecuted, when folks probably know of someone who did the same and got thrown in prison or had their lives ruined...it fits the decades of attacks on Clinton's character as being corrupt and also that she's an elite who is subject to a different set of rules. It's easily relatable and understandable in the post-mortem of the election.

By contrast, the attacks on Hunter Biden and Biden's mental acuity don't hit the mark as effectively. Tying Hunter Biden's activities to Biden himself is a bit convoluted even if you assume it all to be true, which is the same problem Democrats faced when trying to tie Russia to Trump in the Trump collusion investigation. Biden losing his marbles is also one of those things that can only work in ads until someone hears him speak at a live event. It might also be what's pissing off seniors this year, since Biden might have senior moments, but he probably sounds a lot like someone in their 60s or 70s, and most of those folks don't think of themselves as senile. If Trump went after Biden for the groping/inappropriate touching stuff, that opens a can of worms that people probably forgot about, and a lot of older folks might again take offense at the idea that ways they probably show affection based on social mores from decades ago would be characterized as pedophilia or sexual harassment.

If Trump loses, a big part of his loss will be because he failed to stick to a narrative and hammer at it when he was flush with cash. Obama doing this early in '12 and painting Romney as an elitist who was out of touch was likely crucial to winning reelection that year, and Bush did something similar to Kerry too (it does seem to be a bit of a recurring line of attack). Trump's instead opted for 3 or 4 half-baked narratives to attack Biden with, and they're just going nowhere with coronavirus being the elephant in the room. There's also just no time to try something new either - it'd be like taking a cake recipe that calls for 45 mins at 350F and trying to bake it for 15 mins at 1050F."

politics,"Green party candidates often get the reputation of being third party spoilers that ruin a Democrats' chances of winning a race, but in Maine, the state implemented ranked choice voting, so anyone who votes Green on the first ballot can also vote for a different candidate on the second ballot in the (likely) event that the Green party candidate gets eliminated. The Green party nominee for Senate, Lisa Savage, has run a relatively mainstream campaign, but has also repeatedly instructed her supporters to vote Green on the first ballot and vote Dem on the second one, ensuring that she isn't intentionally acting as a spoiler in the race:

politics,"And the Governors took the federal CDC's advice on how to deal with COVID patients because, as it turns out, in a federal system of separation of powers, the federal government is supposed to deal with potential global pandemics by, say, having an advance team in China to monitor the potential for another pandemic, having adequate representation in the WHO, and making the correct test to check for COVID positive patients in the first place. Blaming Governors for listening to Trump's federal government instead of Trump for golfing away while the pandemic was starting is an excuse that only works when you assume you're talking about a toddler."
politics,"Governors followed then-CDC advice on moving people to nursing homes. States do not have the wherewithal to be second guessing the federal CDC on things like that on a matter that the federal government should be on the ball with during the initial stages of a global pandemic. They likely would've caught it sooner if the CDC hadn't sent them defective testing equipment too. The buck plainly stops with Trump on this one, and attempts to diminish his responsibility as Commander-In-Chief right now are showing the American people exactly what kind of ""leader"" he is."

politics,"And again, the Charlottesville thing was one of the few times that Trump got below 40 in his approvals. There's a group of voters who seem to be OK with Trump as long as he isn't openly racist, and them staying at home could be the difference in a lot of seats."
politics,"A lot of the tossups are clustered on the R side. If the national vote shifts 2 more points towards Biden (assuming uniformly, obviously CA or NY getting bluer won't do much), you could see a situation where the GA seats, IA, SC, AK and KS all potentially go blue."

politics,"It's called the ""Get Mitch or Die Trying"" fund that the PSA bros have, which splits money between competitive races. More broadly, there's also ActBlue, where most candidates raise money."
politics,"They might just be setting up a narrative that Trump got a debate bounce. They've done that a couple times, like how he recently led in that poll for the first time, and that was almost certainly to try and drive a narrative that Trump got a convention bounce or that Kenosha was going to decisively shift the race."
politics,"If Biden leads a swing state by the end of the night, he's probably going to keep his lead. Absentees and provisionals typically lean blue, so it's unlikely that Trump will be able to close the gap outside of the election day vote. It's misleading to think that most of Biden's votes will all send their mail ballots on the day of the election and come in much later - most of his votes will likely be banked well before election day and typically only a smaller percentage are still outstanding."
politics,"Depends on the state and the polling. If Biden wins Florida, that's it, that's the election. There's virtually no path right now that shows Trump winning without Florida, and most of their vote comes in on or before election night. If it comes down to some other states, it can get dicier. The late vote will likely be more blue leaning, so we should probably know who won if Biden's ahead in that swing state on election night, but that's enough for Trump to call shenanigans and drag it out. In Pennsylvania, it's especially worrying based on the primary, where Biden trailed Trump in the primary vote on the night of the primary, but ended up leading him comfortably after all the vote was counted two weeks later. Hopefully the winner will come out on election night, but that's something to watch out for. In Arizona, the night of the election in 2018, Martha McSally led by a point, but the late vote ended up swinging the result by 3.5 in Sinema's favor, so that's another one to watch (I think they've changed their laws on this a bit though). 

I would also be cautious of looking at the initial results in a lot of states, because some of them count early ballots first and Democrats are likely to lead those. In Iowa, for instance, expect Democrats to be up something like 10% or more when the numbers start coming in, because that's all early vote and VBM. Same with North Carolina. In other states like Virginia and Georgia, you typically see Republican areas report results first before Democratic strongholds do, so they'll look a lot redder than the final result."
politics,"Maybe that was part of the Trump strategy last night, since he's regularly thrown a bomb whenever he wants people to stop paying attention to something else that was hurting him."
politics,I can't even think of a state where polling suggests this is true. Maybe in Appalachia or something.
politics,"It could be a pretty bad wipeout this year in a class of Senate seats that's kind of oscillated between the parties. The thing about the 2022 class is, even if it's a Biden midterm, the Republicans kind of suffer from the same problem that Dems did in '18 where they've been extremely lucky with that class of Senators for a while, which makes it harder to make gains. The '22 class was last up in '16, which was a relatively good year for Republicans, '10, which was a Republican wave and then '04, which was also a really good year for Republicans. The only offensive targets Republicans really have are New Hampshire and Nevada, whereas Dems might still be able to compete in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Iowa (Grassley is almost certainly retiring)."
politics,"Yeah I think it's underrated how much Biden kept his cool when Trump was attacking the memory of his dead son and also his living one. I mean seriously, Trump's calling Hunter a ""crackhead"" now after Biden made a pretty heartfelt description of Hunter overcoming substance abuse. There's dirty and then there's that. It was completely disgusting and I don't see how it helps Trump's electoral situation in the slightest. Even right leaning people can be disgusted at that kind of behavior."
politics,"What could Biden have done? Trump was repeatedly interrupting to try and throw him off his game, and he was doing it at certain points with the likely intention to force Biden to start stuttering, and there was no way to control what Trump was doing. In a normal debate, there's some interrupting, but it's nowhere the same as last night. Biden did his best to look good for the American people under the circumstances."
politics,"Biden was put on the spot to ask if he condemns violence and he did. He refused to condemn antifa because it's not an organization, but a belief. That seems like a fair way to respond."
politics,"Yeah, Democrats are looking to bank votes early. In some swing states like Wisconsin, they've already hit 11% of 2016 turnout, which is just insane."
politics,"I mean you kind of need to start small I think? The Green party candidate in Maine's Senate race is extremely competent and well-spoken in the debates, and the Democrats don't need to worry about losing votes there because the state is doing RCV this year, and Savage herself is instructing her supporters to rank Gideon second. A lot of these third parties could definitely pick off some state legislative seats and push for ranked choice voting to maximize their presence before trying for the presidency."

There's not much to be gained by more discussion on the topic from Biden's POV, since he got his win by making the story about Trump not denouncing them again, and a further back and forth could've given Trump an opportunity to make a half-hearted correction that his allies would then use to defend him."

politics,"If I'm on the Trump campaign, my focus at this point would be almost exclusively to win PA and FL. These are essentially must-wins for him to stanch the losses from the Upper Midwest and the tight polls in Arizona and Georgia.

politics,"Right, and generally MI is going to flip if WI and PA are flipping. It's the likeliest state to flip towards Dems this year. Biden can afford to even lose NH and still get to 270 votes if he wins back just those 3 states. Trump really needs to be on his A game tomorrow if he wants to swing this back his way, or hope that the polls are off more than they were in 2016."

politics,"PA is the stickiest blue wall state for Dems to flip. Unlike WI and MI where Clinton didn't even bother competing, she dropped a lot of money and did a lot of campaign events in PA and lost it by the most of the 3 states that doomed her. Early on, it seemed like Dems would be better situated in PA than WI, but while WI polls have started seeing wide Dem leads, the numbers have remained relatively tight in PA.

The biggest reason the polls look tight is a Monmouth poll from early September which had the race as Biden +3. It kind of triggered alarm bells and then a bunch of Republican leaning pollsters started finding ties or narrow Trump wins. Most of the live caller good pollsters seem to still think it's a 5-7 point lead for Biden."
politics,"This isn't about his base, I don't think it's wise for anyone to rely on them to not vote for him. But low propensity voters tend to be less well off, less well-educated and far more diverse. This is something that might motivate them to vote where they wouldn't normally."
politics,"I've seen a lot of takes like c) that claim everyone else doesn't understand accounting while not understanding much of it themselves. Amazon is in growth mode and the growth in stock prices is how they deliver value to their shareholders. Trump's company is closely held anyways and the NYT story doesn't at all make it sound like they were reinvesting, but rather just trying to keep a lot of his properties afloat."
politics,"I mean, just putting this into perspective is going to hurt Trump badly. Think about all the ordinary Americans who could've put a little bit more away for retirement, could've saved a bit more their kids' college funds, paid down a credit card or medical bill or car payment if they only had to pay $750 in federal taxes. Think of how many more people could've gotten Medicaid, or college aid, or food stamps if Trump had actually paid his fair share. This is very relatable to ordinary people and that's what makes it so difficult for Trump to just try to stumble out of. There are people with food insecurity and who live paycheck to paycheck who might be paying more in taxes than he is."
politics,"Yeah, he was noticeably aloof today and not like as energized about fighting like he typically is. I haven't really seen him like this since Access Hollywood. He put up more of a fight with the Mueller report even."
politics,"This isn't like Access Hollywood though. In '16, that was a story trying to appeal to Trump supporters to not vote for him because of the moral values they espouse, and that went nowhere. This time, this is a story that is very familiar for people because a lot of people have paid more than $750 in federal taxes in a year. 

One of the reasons why the Clinton emails story hurt so much in 2016 was that so many people have served or worked in defense companies or know people who have done that, and it felt like Clinton was getting off scot free for a crime they'd be behind bars for if they had done the same thing. There was a sense that the elite played by different rules, and it was ordinary people who were dinged. 

This isn't much different. How different would so many people's lives have been if they only paid $750 in federal taxes in 2016 and 2017, much less not paid a dime in taxes for 10 years too? That could've been an extra payment on a credit card, not missing a mortgage or car payment, another year of student loans paid off, being able to save for vacation, get health insurance, or a kid's birthday presents...it's very relatable how that could've affected ordinary Americans."
politics,"FL's definitely the holy grail. It starts counting very early in the night and if Trump loses it, there's no realistic path to winning."
politics,"I mean the third party vote regularly collapses to like 1/3 or less of what they get in the polls. Some of them just don't vote, but others just go to their natural major party affinities. Polls are still showing about 5-8% that might be undecideds, and that's applying a likely voter or registered voter screen. Low propensity voters we know tend to be less well off, more diverse, and have lower college attainment, most of which militates in favor of a more Dem leaning group. If some of them can be persuaded to vote, that's more votes for Dems on net."
politics,"This is always true until it isn't. Illinois used to be a bellwether state to the point of voting for the winner of the presidential election 23 out of 25 times in the 20th century. Now it's a blue state. Missouri used to be accurate too, until it wasn't. Same with Nevada."
politics,We're covering pretty much every poll that's being posted in the Live Thread haha.
politics,"These aren't growth expenses, he made a windfall off the Apprentice over a decade ago and has been consistently taking losses on his resorts and golf courses since. He's exhausted over $100M through securities sales in the past decade trying to keep things afloat."
politics,"Wait what? I can understand that he might not have been doing anything illegal here, but if he's farmed losses to the point where he hasn't paid income tax in 10 of the past 15 years and only paid $750 in another 2 of them, how is that not indicating failure in his businesses? He's not just eating real estate depreciation or anything either."
politics,"Not sure this is going to be the case. It's very understandable that a really rich guy is paying less than an essential worker risking their lives to stock groceries. It won't shift the right's support for him, but for people who are thinking of voting third party or sitting it out, this probably clears out any kind of ambiguity over what's at stake if they were at all unsure. I'd say maybe a 1-2 point shift in the polls here, but that's on top of Trump already not doing so hot to begin with."
politics,"Well he also just didn't pay any for 10 of the past 15 years according to the story too, so there's a few zeroes right there."
politics,He never denied that he wasn't going to divest or put in a blind trust IIRC. It does show exactly why the Framers had the emoluments clause in there in the first place though. Carter had to put his family's fucking peanut farm into a blind trust for goodness sake.
politics,"Yeah, it would depend on the margin. At a state level, they rarely seem to shift the margin by over 4%, so anything greater than a 4% margin in the tipping point state is a bit too far for late votes to change. 

The worst case scenario is in PA. In the June 2 primary, on election night, Joe Biden had 783,311 votes/1,004,112 total in the Dem primary, compared to 886,664 votes/946,182 total votes in the Republican primary for Trump. The final numbers were Biden with 1,264,624/1,595,508 total in the Dem primary and 1,043,311 votes/1,132,213 votes in the R primary for Trump. Biden gained 481,313 votes later on, while Trump gained 156,647, meaning 38% of Biden's votes came in later, while only 15% of Trump's came in late. The two party share of the vote went from Trump winning 53-47 to Biden winning 55-45 in the final numbers. This, coupled with about a 5% rejection rate (which is much higher than the typical 1% rejection rate) for mail votes, is why people are worried about Pennsylvania on the Dem side."
politics,"What do you mean? Like, without the ones that trickle in after election day? There's a good chance of that. The vast majority of the mail vote comes in on or by election night. It will depend on what the size of a lead, if any, would be. If Biden is winning by the numbers he's getting nationally in polls right now (7ish points at least), then it's hard to see him not winning on election night. In 2018, the election night GCB was about D+5, and it shifted to D+8.4 after all the counting was done."
politics,"Politics_Polls on Twitter noted that the late September ABC/WaPo poll from 2016 had Clinton up 49-47 in the two way race...and she won the popular vote 48-46. This was before the debates and Access Hollywood, and would be the best representation of the election fundamentals."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,"The leftists sure don't, but I don't think they can appreciate the nuance here. For reference, just rolling all the people on Obamacare subsidies and who are currently uninsured into Medicaid would cost about $400 billion a year, which is about 10% the cost of Sanders' all the bells and whistles plan."

politics,"Trump's play is to depress Dem turnout by trying to make it seem like it's pointless and he'll cheat to win anyways. It unfortunately seems like it's getting purchase in the media though, so some people might legit believe it. 

Mail voting should certainly be avoided if possible, or done early. The 5% rejection rate in Pennsylvania over naked ballots during the primary (which Trump neglected to mention is why 7 of his own votes were invalidated in Luzerne...because he's suing to disqualify those ballots), and the possibility that Trump will throw a fit if he ""wins"" on election night and loses subsequently, are enough that people should be worried about this."

politics,"Harrison is breaking the ceiling for Democrats in the state, but it's like still a tough slog to be in the lead there. What he's done is create the perfect conditions to capitalize on a bad year for Republicans though. In 2014, Republicans left Ed Gillespie for dead in Virginia because Mark Warner was leading in the polls and everything, to the point where Gillespie ran out of money to run ads a couple weeks before the election. Gillespie lost by like 0.2%. If Harrison catches Graham off guard, something like that could definitely happen again."
politics,"Biden has a brand that's built on being moderate. A lot of the stuff about Clinton being radical in 2016 was built up over decades attacking her, and it wasn't Trump alone who managed to capitalize on that. There just aren't decades of that kind of rhetoric to give people the impression that Biden is a radical. He reminds people of the days when DC politicians could actually work together on things and, even if he does have bolder ideas, people are likely to trust him because he's got a brand of being good at this stuff, so Trump's been flailing hard on how to attack him."

VoteDEM,"Matt Lieberman's Twitter is like a living embodiment of salt right now, saying Warnock is going to be beholden to corporate masters in DC (yikes on that) and that Obama (who he only calls ""44"") is endorsing everyone the corporate elites want. Remind me again how a schoolteacher/entrepreneur is getting most of his money from California, Connecticut and New York in this primary again?"
politics,"The best chance of this is if Biden wins Florida. It reports early, Rs and Ds generally both bank like 60% of their votes early so it won't be like Iowa where the early vote is disproportionately Dem, and about 80% of its vote is in within like an hour or two. If Trump loses Florida, there are few configurations that show him winning nationally."

politics,"Early in person voting strikes the right balance here if you're in a state that has it (and fortunately, almost all swing states have this). You can choose a lower traffic day to vote in person, you know your vote will count, and you have time to fix any problems along the way."
VoteDEM,"TBH this isn't the worst thing, because the candidates themselves are getting the money. AFAIK the DNC/DCCC/DSCC etc. aren't entitled to the Lowest Unit Cost for advertising, so the money is more efficiently spent if the candidates are getting it. In the Conor Lamb PA-18 special, for instance, the Republicans collectively outspent Dems 2:1, but the ads were closer to parity because Lamb had more cash on hand than Saccone, and was able to deploy it more efficiently."
politics,"The way they justify it is like....it's not even law. ""Look, this magazine article from the 1700s proves me right!"" or ""Look, a letter one of the Founding Fathers wrote shows that this is correct!"" The biggest lie perpetrated by originalists is that they have any rational reason why they come to the conclusions that they do, when it was, and has always just been a pretext to support the conclusions they want to reach, at least when it comes to important cases."
politics,"A third party candidate who was running in MN-02 died. In 2018, this candidate's party, the ""Legal Marijuana Now"" party, won 5% of the vote in the race for state auditor, which granted it ""major party"" status. Under Minnesota law, the death of any ""major party"" candidate 79 days before the election leads the election to be canceled and instead moved to a later date. This means that the election for this seat will be in February of 2021. Any votes cast for the MN-02 candidates for November will be invalidated and not tabulated.

MN-02 has a Democratic incumbent, Angie Craig, who will be forced to vacate her seat in January. The race is rated Likely Dem, but special elections are typically low turnout and unpredictable, so there is a possibility she could lose it in 2021. Democrats also hold a 5-3 advantage in the House delegation from Minnesota, but Congressman Colin Petersen is the most vulnerable Democrat in the House, holding down a seat that Trump won by over 20 points. In the event that there is a tie in the Electoral College, it is possible that Republicans will have a majority of the delegation as a result of this vacancy from Minnesota and cast their votes that way, even if Minnesota does not vote for Trump."
politics,"There have been several states that tried to do this and realized that the cost was too expensive. Vermont, Colorado and California each formed committees to study the costs, and each of them would have involved doubling the size of the state's spending. Washington implemented a public-ish option though and that seems to be working OK, though it's not government run but rather offered as a plan by a syndicate of private insurers."
politics,"I think the networks all broadcast the debates, unlike in the primaries where only the network sponsor gets to."
politics,"Jorgensen sequesters votes that likely lean more Trump than Biden, since she is very very libertarian. The Green Party might siphon votes from Biden but they are only on the ballot in 26 states. It's important to note that a lot of their votes are legit coming from people who want to vote third party though, and they aren't just disgruntled Democrats or Republicans necessarily."
politics,"I think for Democrats, there's a sense that, after all that's going on, it shouldn't be close at all. I mean, Biden is ahead by 7 points, the DNC/Biden/etc. have over $100M more in cash than the RNC/Trump/etc., and crucially, more of it is in the hands of Biden himself than in the hands of Trump (this matters because candidates are entitled to cheaper advertising rates compared to party committees and superPACs), and most swing state polling in Biden's core 270 shows him looking good. But there are some bad polls, Florida in particular is stubbornly close, and there are reports that a lot of mail ballots in PA (the tipping point state that Biden's only up by 3ish in right now) are getting rejected because of a technicality, so it does make people worry."
politics,OK but that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
politics,What would that show?
politics,"They're a really good pollster nationally, but this is their first foray into state polling that I'm aware of. They had some wildly unrealistic number out of Minnesota for Biden last week too (Biden likely carries the state, but 17 points is enormous)."
politics,"A lot of people are probably jaded from 2016 so the polls showing it even close are causing panic. In 2016, Clinton's numbers were almost certainly worse than this but people felt like it was going to be a win and that burned them."
politics,"If you want a bit of a silver lining, the polls in Arizona seem to typically underestimate Democrats a bit. In 2018, the final aggregate of the Senate polls there had McSally up 1, and she went on to lose by 2.5. In 2016, the final polling average had Trump up 4, and he won by 3.5. In 2012, the final polling average for the Senate race had Flake up by 5.5 and he only won by 3. It's not as pronounced as the Nevada effect (where pollsters underestimate Democrats by a consistent 2-4 points, if not more), but it's still discernible to some extent."
politics,"The most winnable races where money can make a difference (ie. not Arizona where Mark Kelly has a money printer, and Gideon is probably fine in Maine at this point too) are Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia and Montana. Iowa and North Carolina are the 50th and 51st seats in a hypothetical Democratic majority in the Senate, but they've also been deluged with money, with both sides preparing to spend $155M in Iowa and $200M in NC. That money will go a long way in Iowa though.

Georgia's a bit pricier to advertise in because Atlanta is so big, but the race is closeish, with Jon Ossoff getting close enough to Perdue there. It's also a bang for buck thing, since more Dem turnout might also help the other election there. 

Montana is probably the ideal place to spend. Trump won this state by 18 points, but Steve Bullock won reelection in '16 by 4 points on the same ballot. Polling either has him up a little, tied, or down like 1 or 2 points, and Montana is a very cheap place to place ads. On balance, if you want your dollars to stretch, that's probably the best place to go, though the fundamentals of the race might favor the Republican."
politics,"Nope, he'd have to take a blue wall state too, most likely Pennsylvania, and it doesn't eliminate the possibility that Biden can flip NC, where polls are also in a dead heat right now. And he also needs to not lose ME-02 or NE-02, though they don't really make the difference in many simulations."
politics,"OH and TX are probably narrow Trump wins at the moment (in the 2-3 point range), while Florida is now a dead heat again if maybe leaning slightly towards Trump. Biden can win without any of these, and has seemingly based most of his strategy on flipping back the blue wall and winning Arizona."
politics,"Candidates historically tend to do very well money-wise in the month that they have their convention. When the convention happens, they transition to becoming a general election candidate, which lets them tap donors again for another $2800 check. In some cases, some people will just give $5600 outright for both the primary and general at once. 

It's actually a little bizarre that Trump's fundraising was this bad last month. He raised $72M and spent $64M, leaving him with only an $8M increase to his COH. By contrast, Biden raised $213M and spent about $130M. In 2012, Obama raised $126M and spent about $115M in September when the DNC was."
politics,"Yeah it's a bit of a red flag for Biden, though it's important to note that Langer, despite being pretty much _the_ gold standard pollster for the national race, hasn't really done much state polling before, so we don't have much in terms of prior numbers to assess how well they do in states. There is evidence that Florida remains unusually strong for Trump, albeit not at a 4 point lead, but the Arizona numbers are kind of a head scratcher considering how every other pollster treats that state (and also how the campaigns are treating it)."
politics,"Essentially yes. The election is generally viewed by organizing each state based on their expected margin of victory for one candidate or the other. The state in this organization that hypothetically casts the 270th vote is known as the tipping point state. Currently, that's looking like it's going to be Pennsylvania, because Biden's numbers there are weak and there are some polls showing tightening, but he's still up around 3-4 points when you factor in house effects of polls. Florida is to the right of the tipping point state, and Texas will only flip after Florida, Arizona and Georgia have likely flipped already, so if either of them flips to Biden, then he likely has the votes to win."
politics,"It'd be a very bizarre legal theory for someone to sue under. The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the authority to designate the size of the Supreme Court, and the 9 justice Court is set by statute. Moreover, the Supreme Court, and conservative Justices in particular consider Congressional rulemaking (ie. getting rid of the filibuster) to be explicitly political and outside their purview, since the Constitution explicitly states that each House of Congress decides their own rules of organization."
politics,The first part of that sentence explicitly talks about Cunningham. The entire entry talks about North Carolina. It has to be the most uncharitable interpretation to remotely suggest I'm saying talking about the national election.
politics,"The entry was about the North Carolina Senate race, what gave you the impression that I was talking about the national election? The race for North Carolina is a dead heat, with Biden either sporting very narrow leads or tied. FiveThirtyEight gives Biden a 54% chance of winning the state right now."
politics,"I think I've settled on the idea that a SCJ being confirmed before the election may help Trump but will hurt Senate Republicans. If they pick one before the election, Trump gets to run on a record, while liberals might have depressed turnout and Biden would need to come out in favor of court packing to keep them going to the polls, which could scare off ""institution"" moderates. If they pick one after the election, Biden can continue to just say that he opposes a confirmation, Democrats will be energized up and down the ballot, but Republicans might feel exigency to vote for their Senate incumbents too."
politics,"It’s important not only to look at the polling spread, but the percent shares of a poll. A lot of the double digit leads that Biden had before were like 49-38 or something, and like, Trump was never going to get under 40% of the vote. He’s almost certainly getting at least 43-46% of the vote, so the tightening in many states is from Trump consolidating undecideds who were likely to go his way anyways."
politics,"They're hedging their bets this time a lot as a result. There are a couple differences though that are salient:

* In 2016, Clinton led many swing state polls, but her leads were weak. The polls had her in the mid 40s, but just had Trump in the low 40s. Those are unrealistically low numbers for major party candidates and, coupled with the fact that people who hated both Clinton and Trump favored Trump in that election by double digits, it was setting the stage for an upset with the undecideds/third party vote disproportionately going for Trump. This time around, there are much fewer third party votes and Trump and Biden are much closer to 50 in the states that they're inclined to win.

* Pollsters did not weight for education in 2016, which was problematic because the correlation between education and party vote was very strong and college educated voters answering disproportionately skewed the results towards Clinton. This time around, most pollsters are weighing by education. [Here's an example](https://twitter.com/christinezhang/status/1301925521777987596) of the effect of educational weighing on a poll."
politics,"Much of this movement right now is from the election getting closer. A lot of Trump's odds are tied to uncertainty - if the economy meaningfully snaps back, if COVID concerns dissipate, etc., he will benefit from that and he has a good chance of gaining in the polls. Basically, the model's priors tend to favor the incumbent. However, the fewer days there are left, the more the 538 and other models start trusting the polls more. 

There also isn't enough polling to see what the effect of SCOTUS stuff will be. It usually takes a week or two for this stuff to percolate into the national polling and sometimes longer for state polling. We'll probably know what's up by next week, though a few early polls by Data for Progress and Yougov (both are online IIRC) seem to suggest this is energizing Democrats a bit more than Republicans."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,What is with the number of European Bernouts lately? I'm noticing it more and more and it's cute how they always seem to think they're part of a US movement.

At this point, CO and AZ both seem like likely D races, AL seems sadly likely R, and both ME and NC are edging towards lean D. After those two groups, the tier of GA-Special, AK and KS seems theoretically doable, but it's pretty late in the cycle and there's not enough polling to suggest that they're on track to flipping."

Instead, he threw his lot in with COVID and mask skeptics because he thought that they'd help him restart the economy which, to the surprise of no one, has led to us having no real control over the virus, and no sustainable economic recovery. Trump keeps pushing this idea that he needs to sweep COVID under the rug or something and the economy will recover, but the economy isn't going to recover if large swathes of society don't feel safe going outside and consuming services or products. And people aren't going to necessarily feel safe taking a vaccine that they know Trump is pushing with minimal regard for safety too.

If he had taken climate change seriously, the severity of these hurricanes would've been a segue into pushing for green infrastructure jobs at home that would've been a stimulus that served long term energy security and economic growth goals in a way that would be tailored to his nativist brand. If he could've shown just a speck of decency with these protests, or made a forceful denunciation of the boogaloo types who are killing people at the protests, he could've undermined Biden's self-professed reason for running in the first place and gone a long way towards restoring his standing with critical suburban college educated whites.

politics,"CNN's poll is the one exception, with all other polls showing no real movement or a slight uptick for Biden after he picked Harris. CNN's poll also has an historic tendency to bounce around - while the June poll had Biden up 14 points, the May poll (when the polling aggregate was showing Biden nearly up 10 points) had Biden only up 5, with the one before that in April having Biden up 11. Outliers happen and what's happening with other polls is not statistically significant when viewed as an aggregate. 

The enthusiasm gap only matters in close elections, and it's too early to draw conclusions about it now. Simply asking users is a useless metric - it's about the divide between a registered voter and likely voter model. To that end, Trump does slightly better with the LV model, but he's still losing handily in the respectable polls that are starting to test both scenarios."

politics,">No one was asking for IN interference. It was a measuring stick for what is considered acceptable inaccuracies.

And I'm saying that the UN standard as a measuring stick is irrelevant here because these aren't the same kind of exit polls. 

>When the denominator of a fraction changes you can't directly subtract percentages you have to do math on the fractions. I think that might be where your confusion is.

The denominator shouldn't change at all. Again, if Biden was projected to get 34% in the exit polls and got 38%, is that a discrepancy of 4% or 12%? People would tend to believe it's the former and not the latter.

>The author of that web page is the same man who uncovered the fraud of Bush's election too.

Considering the polling didn't really show fraud in that election, that does suggest the allegations this time are nonsense too. Literally one pollster had Kerry leading in Ohio in the lead up to the election while the rest of them all showed him losing. 

>His claim is the exit poll data that was published after polls closed is modified.

This isn't a claim, it's what the exits do. They're reweighed as actual results come in. 

>The trend of the votes was completely broken and the volume necessary to reach these changes is very large.

If he's been finding fraud since '04, it sounds like the issue lies with him.

>At the very least this should raise enough doubt that there should had been an audit of the vote counts.

A conspiracy theorist feeling like there was a conspiracy shouldn't raise enough doubt for any of that."
politics,"This researcher's allegations are complete nonsense. He dishonestly took the early exit polls and compared them against the results to reach his conclusions. Exit polls come in waves, and they aren't accurate enough to draw a conclusion from until they're done and the networks can match the numbers with what's actually being reported. The numbers this guy uses as the baseline are the early exits from before everyone has even finished voting, which is notable if you think one group of voters is more inclined to vote earlier than another. 

Moreover, the discrepancies are dishonestly inflated to make them seem larger than they are. If Joe Biden got 34% in an exit poll but 38% in the actual result, do you call that a 4% discrepancy or a 12% discrepancy? Ordinary people take the discrepancy to be 4%, but this guy uses 34% as the denominator for calculating discrepancy so that he can make it look like a bigger issue than it is. 

Additionally, this didn't just happen in Dem states, it happened in Rep states too, so somehow Republicans would be down to support Biden too, when all known information suggests that they wanted Bernie to win if at all possible. The DNC has no authority over how the states conduct or receive ballots. It couldn't even tell Iowa's state party to conduct a canvass. 

And finally, there's a preliminary issue that premises this whole ""analysis"" that exit polls are used by the UN to determine voter fraud. That's partially true, but it's not applicable here. Exit polls in countries where the UN is monitoring an election are very different from media exit polls. They're often sample sizes with tens of thousands of respondents for a country probably on par with a medium sized state here, and the only question they get asked is who they voted for. Media exit polls in the US are very different, often having much smaller sample sizes, and typically having a list of questions like age/income/gender/education level/etc. which often results in some degree of response bias because people might not want to respond to a poll that'll take 10 minutes to answer.

Trump would have to agree to step down or there'd have to be some colossal pledged delegate rebellion of sorts for him not to get the nomination at this point, and that's just unlikely because (1) Trump wants to win reelection badly; and (2) the GOP likely doesn't have a much better option waiting in the wings. Replacing him with another candidate isn't going to meaningfully improve the GOP's chances of winning the presidency, but it risks alienating Trump's base so that they don't turn out."
politics,"Congressional Republicans seem inclined to break from Trump if his polling continues to be weak, which they did in '96 when Dole lost to Clinton and which helped save their majorities in Congress. It's hard to see how effective that would be these days though, with polarization the way it is. Susan Collins is likely to do much better than Trump in Maine, but if Trump is losing that state by too much, there's just not enough latitude to pull out a win. A similar issue like this happened in the reverse in 2016, when Jason Kander in Missouri was running far ahead of Clinton in the Senate race, but the state was just too red for him to flip the seat."
politics,"With the Republican convention in late August, it'll probably be around mid-September before the polls finally stabilize. That sounds like a fun competition though - we ran something similar for the primaries where people got a special flair and some reddit gold for correctly predicting the winners of the primaries, so we could certainly consider something like this in a low stakes environment."
politics,"You should probably take a look at the FiveThirtyEight pollster ratings that's linked above to get a sense of which of these are reputable. Also keep in mind that a few of these are internal pollsters that the parties selectively release results for (GQRR and Garin-Hart-Yang are Democratic internal pollsters, PPP is run by Democrats and most of their polls are on behalf of Democratic organizations, meanwhile Echelon is a Republican pollster IIRC), so these might be rosy results for their side even if they're generally good pollsters."
politics,"In a close race, that's true, but a Democrat leading the popular vote by more than 4 or 5 points is unlikely to lose the electoral college, and a Republican that's tied or down 1 has a good chance of winning still. National polls tend to be pretty accurate despite 2016, whereas a lot of state polling was off by a lot more."
VoteDEM,"Still not quite understanding why a guy whose claim to fame is being a former one term congressman from Florida nearly 8 years ago got so far in the convention, much less winning outright the TX GOP chairmanship."
VoteDEM,"They say they have polls from 2016 but I don't see any. Waybackmachine only has a snapshot from 2018, though the site was registered in 2016. While there are still some Demosaur types who are just Dixiecrats who forgot to change their registration or w/e, Trump kind of ended much of that phenomenon in 2016 since a lot of them changed their registration to vote for him. Almost makes me think this is a fake poll released to game the betting markets."
modnews,"Thanks for the AMA! A few (hopefully quick) questions:

1. What level of severity does reddit want moderators to punish users with for these kinds of comments? Ie. other than removing the comment, does the site want all users who make comments that could be interpreted as promoting hate against one of the classes listed above to all be permanently banned or temporarily banned or just told to knock it off?

2. How would reddit handle issues such as users using FBI crime statistics when it comes to race and policing (and analogous statistics in places like the UK and Europe with minorities there)? While the use of those statistics to make an explicit argument that an entire race is more violent is undoubtedly hateful, would any use of these statistics constitute hate speech under this rule?

3. Is the hate speech rule intended to cover instances beyond the listed identities and vulnerability? For instance, political affiliation is not covered under Rule 1, but if a user were to make exceptionally dehumanizing language towards people of a political persuasion (eg. calling them cockroaches, or inbred etc.), does that get to a point where it violates Rule 1, or some other reddit rule?

Thank you!"
politics,"Yeah, it's not the tipping point state this year. Polling likely has it flipping before Ohio does and after Georgia. But if Clinton lost it by 8 while winning the popular vote by 2, it's not unexpected to see Biden in range of flipping the state if the polls show him up nationally by 8-10 points."
politics,"Yeah, Andrew Gillum was leading polls by 4-8 points only to lose by 0.1% in the 2018 gubernatorial race. Florida is just a high turnout state where everyone on either side knows the stakes and why they have to go vote. It's also a state where phonebanking and volunteering in the state likely pay off in a big way because of how much it's just about mobilization."
politics,"The biggest issue is that his standing with seniors is declining because of how he's handled the coronavirus. It might also be a double whammy for Republicans in that state too, since they've traditionally outpaced Democrats in early voting by pushing vote by mail, which Trump is essentially telling people not to do. If it's still unsafe by election day to go out as much, you could see a lot of polling stations close, for instance, and some older more conservative people either unable or unwilling to go out to vote."
politics,"Steve Schale had this thing in 2018 before the election about how, if you took the results for every statewide election in Florida since '92 or something and added the votes for each party, the difference in votes would be like 20K. It's probably 50K now after the 2018 election, but it really illustrates how inelastic and divided Florida is."
politics,"They should be more accurate as we get closer to the election, but the screens can vary a lot depending on the pollster. Historically, Labor Day is when people were thought to start paying attention to the election and when the LV model was more touted by the media, since a lot of people haven't made up their mind yet depending on how the question is asked."
politics,"One of the biggest reasons for the polling error at the state level (national polls actually did pretty well) in 2016 was that state pollsters did not generally weigh for education. Since the polling post-mortem after that election, most pollsters have incorporated this, particularly in swing states which had big misses."
politics,"Keep in mind that some of these polls aren't really intended to sample the presidential race, but rather, Senate races (it's just, why not poll everything if you're paying for it?). GHY is a Democratic internal pollster and the poll is meant to highlight a close result for the Senate race, where McGrath trails McConnell by only 4 points (45-41). It's usually actually seen favorably if the Senate nominees are doing better than their party's presidential nominees."
politics,"Neither side should treat the polls as dogma, but it's also likely that neither side will. Republicans tend to seem to think that another polling upset in their favor is likely (and while we don't have a consistent polling error one way or another, in countries like the UK, there is such a thing as a shy Tory voter), and so do Democrats. On balance, that's probably not great for Republicans, since their base is more inclined to dismiss the urgency in the polls whereas Democrats likely won't leave anything to chance this time. Moreover, with President Trump attacking vote-by-mail (which Republicans rely on to bank votes in swing states like Florida and Arizona), that's leaving a lot to election-day turnout, which is fraught with danger this year given the coronavirus."
politics,"Gravis isn't a particularly good pollster though. There's [some evidence](https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/1283049281411325953) that they are willing to give numbers that look ""good"" to a particular side, and they've been courting left-leaning Election Twitter for business ever since a group of them managed to crowdfund a couple polls (the Alaska PPP poll, which was more for the Senate race numbers than the prez numbers). When asked about why their polls for OANN were so favorable to Trump, they claimed that OANN was selectively releasing good polls, but I mean even Fox will release polls that look bad for Trump.

That being said, South Carolina's kind of a ""high floor, low ceiling"" state for Democrats, so it can get close, but Democrats struggle to win it. The large African American population means that Democrats generally can hit 40%, and in some instances are even able to get above 45% (in 2010, Vince Shaheen got 47% of the vote in the gubernatorial election against Nikki Haley and James Smith got 46% in the 2018 gubernatorial race), but hitting 50% or exceeding the Republican margin is difficult because of how right-leaning southern whites are. In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost the white vote nationally by 20 points, but lost it in South Carolina by a much larger 45%."

Before _June Medical_ had been decided, Court watchers noted that, because Breyer was the only one who had not written an opinion in the month that the case was argued, he was likely to write the opinion for the abortion case. Are there other traditions that SCOTUS follows that are used as tea leaves for pending cases?"
politics,"Not even that, he threatened to take away Mary Trump’s nephew’s health insurance to force her and her brother to give up their claim to a $20 million inheritance from their grandfather (Trump’s dad). That nephew was born with cerebral palsy and the family had agreed beforehand to support him with the company’s health insurance plan."
politics,"I mean Trump kind of went after them first:

>In 1999, just after Fred I's funeral, Fred III's child was born with cerebral palsy. The Trump family agreed to pay for the child's medical expenses. Fred I's will was revealed, which Donald Trump helped to write. The will mandated that Fred II, and by extension his children, Fred III and Mary, would be left out from receiving most of the inheritance, which amounted to over $20 million. Fred III and Mary filed a lawsuit, alleging that Fred II's siblings, including Donald, used ""undue influence"" on a dementia-addled Fred I to cut them out of the inheritance. **Donald Trump reacted by removing the medical benefits for Fred III's infant**; declaring: ""I was angry because they sued."" Donald later said that the lawsuit was settled ""very amicably"".

I guess when your nephew's life is being threatened because your supposedly billionaire uncle wants to deny you $20M in inheritance money, you kind of don't have a good impression of them."

politics,"Probably not. He was tapped for Ambassador to China by Obama in part because he was a more moderate (IIRC he supported civil unions in Utah back when gay marriage was the major culture war issue) and stronger opponent than Romney for 2012. Working with Obama did pretty much kill his 2012 ambitions. This time, Biden doesn't really gain much from tapping Huntsman for anything like that.

There is an argument to be had that Biden is just doing better with older people though, especially with coronavirus raging."
politics,"I think it’d be a little hard to prohibit that since it’s an opinion we express in the OP, and it’s also something both parties are pushing, with Biden’s team last week tweeting to...ignore the polls.

todayilearned,"For Los Angeles in particular though, there’s a bit of a sketchy history to the water that it receives. A lot of it comes from the Owens Valley in Northern California and is piped to Los Angeles through a series of aqueducts.

politics,"Florida reminds me of what Harry Reid used to say about how Susan Collins’ vote was “only there when we didn’t need it”. Florida is just unlikely to be the tipping point state, and if it is, that’s not a comfortable position to be in for Biden given how many times Republicans have managed to seize victory from the jaws of defeat there. But if it does go blue, Biden’s likely en route to 320 or more electoral votes."
politics,"Reminder to folks that there are competitive downballot races today. Just a few that come to mind include:

1. In Iowa, Congressman Steve King is facing a competitive Republican primary to hold onto his seat, after he was stripped of all of his committee assignments after making a racist remark. If no one clears 35% in that seat, it goes to a district convention.

2. Also in Iowa, there is a comparatively competitive race for the Democratic nomination for Senate to face off against Senator Joni Ernst in the fall. 

3. In Montana, there are competitive races on both the Democratic and Republican side to win the at-large Congressional seat this November, which is being vacated by Rep. Greg Gianforte, who is running for Governor. 

4. In New Mexico, the state's Senate seat is an open seat this year. Additionally, there's a competitive Democratic primary in NM-03, where Teresa Legere Fernandez is facing off largely against Valerie Plame, most well known for having her identity illegally leaked during the Bush administration."

This Amy Cooper graduated from college in 2003, meaning even if she had moved to the US the same year, it's almost guaranteed she was not eligible to donate to the Kerry campaign.

This is utterly trash reporting that's easily debunked, but The Independent has gone to shit lately on the quality front so this isn't surprising."

politics,"Whether it meshed with reality or not isn't the point - that was the perception that came out of exit polling. Maybe that was Trump being able to flood the zone successfully in a way that ordinary politicians had never seen before that got this to work (who ordinarily pounce on any small misstep by the other side, much like how Romney made the 2012 convention slogan ""you built this"" for the RNC because of a supposed misstatement by Obama), but in either event, it's a dynamic that will be hard to play up this time as the public has gotten used to having the zone flooded constantly by controversial things he said, and the fact that Biden's stances are very clearly aimed at criticizing Trump's policies."
politics,"Right, one of the criticisms of Clinton after the election was that she spent too much time talking about Trump while Trump basically just offered up his vision of America. On substance, people knew less about Clinton's platform than they did about Trump's, and that caused people who hated them both to take a chance on Trump. This time, the election is about Trump whether he likes it or not, but he's still running the same playbook as 2016."
politics,"That's also kind of the secret behind people who get lauded for supposedly predicting election outcomes - they never get called out for the bad predictions they make. Michael Moore these days is almost always introduced in articles as the guy who ""correctly"" predicted that Trump would win the election, even though he later said that Clinton would likely win in 2016, and also said that Obama would lose in 2012. It's basically why all the pundits seem to hedge their bets like this now."
politics,"Crucially, Clinton and Trump were in an open seat race in 2016, whereas Biden and Trump are in a reelection race for an incumbent president this year. Where Trump had a greater claim to be an insurgent looking to change Washington in 2016, which he used effectively with the Drain the Swamp stuff, he doesn't get to say that this year when he _is_ the swamp, which is part of why he is desperately trying to figure out a new strategy. 4 years ago, voters saw a decent economy and wanted to try something new, naively hoping that Trump would eventually become more ""presidential"" while also delivering on promises to maximize economic growth and prosperity. Fast forward to today, and the economy is in the toilet, and Trump was at the helm when that happened."

Trump being fat is not an immutable characteristic, and he's made it fair game for himself by attacking people for their looks repeatedly, including their weight (something about how he's only seen fat women drink diet coke). It was in bad taste to make a comment like that, but unless you're claiming that he has a disability that predisposes him to being fat even though he looked fairly normal decades ago, this is not remotely the same thing as a slur against race, sexual orientation or gender."
politics,"Honestly, I am a lot more confident in MeToo after this than before. With Biden weathering something like 3-4 fake accusations in the past two months, it's shown that fake accusations generally don't withstand scrutiny nearly as well as people assume. Reade evidently had planned this thing since last year, which is what the lawyer acquaintance she had was saying, and it's still fallen apart this badly. Women who have a real story that they aren't into embellishing and manipulating should still be able to have their voices heard."

politics,"Worth noting that what to watch for tonight is not so much who wins in CA-25, but how much one candidate is leading. Early returns should lean Garcia, since Republicans tend to return their ballots earlier. Smith, if she does pull it off, is going to rely on later ballots that were likely returned today. Thus, if Garcia's up by a lot tonight, Smith probably won't win, but if Garcia's ""only"" up by 5 or so points, there's possibly enough ballots out there that Smith pulls it off in the end. If Smith is at all up tonight, there's a good chance she will win."
politics,"While true, the state has been a lot closer than its record suggests. Kerry won the state by just 11K votes, and Gore carried it by less than 6K votes - each of these margins being far lower than the 23K margin that Trump won it by. Obama made winning the blue wall states look easy by handily carrying the state in 2008 by a whopping 14 points and over 400K votes and in 2012 with over 210K votes (even winning Paul Ryan's congressional district on the presidential level), but that was a mistaken calculation that cost them badly in 2016. We'll see this time if the magic of the Obama-Biden ticket in carrying the Midwest will have had more to do with Obama (being a midwestern Senator and being more relatable to Midwestern values) or if Biden played a big role in that as ""middle class Joe"" who appealed to non-college educated whites. So far, the polling shows a narrow Biden lead in the state, but it's way too early either way."
politics,"Why would the only copy of the complaint possibly be with Biden's Senate files? It flies in the face of basic HR and privacy laws for the accused to have a copy of a workplace complaint filed against them, which is what was raised when the senate responded to Biden's inquiry. Moreover, the senate secretary provided a guideline for the 5 step process that would've needed to be completed before a formal complaint was filed. Based on Reade's own description of what she did (she filed a complaint on a clipboard and said she was ""uncomfortable""), there is no way she completed this process."
politics,"And that’s the crux of both the health care and economic arguments. If people don’t feel safe, they won’t travel or spend money. Restaurants that are opening to 1/4 capacity because of social distancing can’t possibly be solvent. Businesses that rely in any significant fraction on older customers are not going to do well. The reopenings might temporarily see a boost in business just because people have been cooped up at home for so long, but once the novelty wears off, it’s likely that the false start will end up hurting more businesses than not, especially if there’s a second wave. The V shaped recovery would easily turn into a W.

It just seems like the easiest thing right now to justify dumping billions into testing and contact tracing capacity. That would go a long way to assuaging concerns on health and improve consumer confidence."
politics,"She was also attacked online by Twitter leftists for supporting Biden, with some of them apparently claiming she’s intentionally not coming out about worse sexual assault by Biden because she supports him now. Ironic that they want to say this is still about believing women."

The people hoping this gets them Bernie as the nominee seem to be more prevalent online, but it’s certainly convenient and aimed at getting people to go bust on backing Biden."

politics,"She’s apparently expanded the range of when it could’ve happened from March-April to like 4 months or so, because people dug up old weather reports and found that April 20th that year was the only day that was warm enough that she’d be going out with crotch less panties and without stockings. Biden had a credible alibi that day. 

Also don’t forget that all of these corroborators are only corroborating at best that she told them about these things, not that they necessarily happened. Eva Murry had 6 corroborators for her claim of sexual harassment including her own aunt, who ran against Biden, and Biden wasn’t even at the event it supposedly happened in. When they tried 2007, Biden wasn’t even in the state."

* On the Reade allegation, a narrow plurality (37-32) believe it happened, splitting mostly on partisan lines (50% of Republicans believe it vs. 20% of Democrats)

* Trump's approval has declined to 40-53, down 10 points from his high of 46-49 in March"
politics,"All these grifter left outlets spent the past month trying to turn this into a silver bullet, with Nathan Robinson going as far as to coach Reade and her brother in their responses to reporters. This is really a mask off moment for what they were really trying to accomplish, and it had nothing to do with justice."
politics,"It looks very likely that Loeffler will not make the runoff. Democrats have a decent candidate with Warnock and Trump actually tried to lobby Kemp to appoint Collins to this seat in the first place (he's also running). Loeffler was supposed to be a more electable candidate than Collins to hold the seat, so with this scandal, that's kind of gone by the wayside."
VoteDEM,"Darn, guess affirming something under the penalty of perjury doesn't matter as much as it used to. It might still be a bad look for her in the general though."
VoteDEM,"With the Arizona House, there's a chance the GOP have already lost one of their candidates:

politics,"And you continue to point to an irrelevant indicator. Trump had no division within his party for the nomination, while Biden had a contested primary to win. Those hard feelings historically go away during the convention, which is part of the bounce that the parties get in the first place. Look at what happened to Obama in 2012 post-convention with a far more useful measure of the enthusiasm gap in terms of the LV-RV discrepancy:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sept-12-polls-since-conventions-point-to-decline-in-enthusiasm-gap/

It simply isn't a major issue at this point in time when the primary has effectively been frozen since late March."
politics,"Honestly, if that's where you want to take it, go ahead. Trump's advisors are already telling him to lay off the dementia stuff because it's seriously hurting him with senior voters (who he also seems keen to sacrifice for the economy). Biden's lead in a lot of these states is predicated on doing better with that demographic than Clinton or Obama, which has been the case even before coronavirus was a major concern."
politics,"No, it doesn't. Here's Gallup showing the same phenomenon as a prelude to 2012:

https://news.gallup.com/poll/156194/democratic-voting-enthusiasm-down-sharply-2004-2008.aspx

Most of the enthusiasm gap will likely dissipate when the conventions happen. And the rest of it likely won't matter, especially if leftists in deep blue states that'll vote for Biden anyways are less than enthused."
politics,"Your article does not state that. Romney sported a [62-49 lead](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2012/08/13/enthusiasm-gap-means-mitt-romney-could-blow-out-president-obama) in enthusiasm in August of 2012. In the end, he still lost. The Dems having an enthusiasm gap story is thrown around in every presidential election."
politics,"And as we all know, people who are enthusiastic get two votes instead of one right? Republicans usually win the enthusiasm gap question, it's not even a big deal. Romney consistently led on this metric and the polling even reflected a much tighter race in 2012 partially as a result, and Obama still won reelection fairly comfortably."
politics,"I think we should have respected Blasey-Ford's initial wishes to not testify publicly over those allegations, which The Intercept shamelessly and despicably refused to honor in its attempt to take down Feinstein. But when she did come forward publicly, she was credible, testifying under oath and describing the event with such specificity that even Kavanaugh's calendars could show the date the incident was said to have occurred on."
VoteDEM,Why'd he post it today then https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/comments/ge2ri3/hi_im_former_south_carolina_gamecocks_wide/
politics,"The Senate secretary released a document yesterday showing the 5 step process to file a formal complaint. What's described is absolutely different from what Reade claims she filed, because she'd have to go through counseling and other things before it got to the step described. At best, there may be a copy of Reade's intake form where she talked about feeling ""uncomfortable"" in lieu of saying she was raped, but there's no reason to believe that Biden would've received a copy of it."
politics,"She bet that Biden would clam up and deny it instead of pushing for the Senate to try and find this as well as get the procedures on the record. Reade described her complaint as writing about how she was ""uncomfortable"" (instead of being raped) on a clipboard. It sounded like an intake form at best. She specifically mentioned the counseling office which she said last year she chickened out of going to. According to the Senate secretary, a formal complaint at the time would've been a 5-step procedure that _started_ with counseling. So in the best case scenario for her, there's a record of her starting something, but nothing she describes would've been a formal complaint.

It also makes it impossible for Biden to have a copy of it, much less for a copy of it to exist in his UDel archive. If she didn't finish the procedure, he wouldn't have gotten a formal notice, and it definitely would not have been in the archive that he voluntarily donated. 

The law that's being quoted does seem to suggest that Reade herself may have been able to request the disclosure of the initial complaint though (so much for the leftist brain trust here - how many top tier law degrees do Robinson, Gray and all the people pushing this have again?). It sounds like it's in her court if she wants to keep this going, because there are obvious privacy concerns that make it impossible for Biden to compel the documents to be turned over."
VoteDEM,"Cooper's been a consummately competent Governor through all of this and his term so far, meanwhile Forest has ties to corrupt lobbyists or something. Really is bizarre to me that the NC GOP couldn't find someone a bit better than him to run here."
VoteDEM,"This race isn't looking too hot (though if we lose it, we're likely picking it up again in Fall), but with most Democrats returning ballots late, this last week will make a huge difference on whether or not we can hold it."
politics,"We're now also finding out that her description of filing the complaint is at odds with what they did in the Senate at the time, because she specifically said last year that she chickened out of going into the counseling office which would've been the first step to filing a formal complaint, and talked about writing things about being uncomfortable on a clipboard. It's almost certain at this point that she did not go through the 5 step process to filing a formal complaint, even if she may have filed something, which also means there is no way that Biden would have a record of it in his UDel papers even if there's some record of her starting the process."
politics,"This race is a solid pickup opportunity for Democrats, but this poll's kind of got some red flags. The pollster was in the field for 17 days with this one (typically they're in for 3-5, maybe 7 days at most) and Bullock beating Daines by 7 points is somehow within its margin of error. Still, Dems landed their strongest possible challenger here and Bullock's gotten very good marks for how he's been handling coronavirus so far, so it's very likely he's up right now."
todayilearned,I've read that they also test for art forgeries based on new elements that were introduced into the atmosphere as a result of nuclear testing.
VoteDEM,"Yeah, it's going to be tough, she'll need a bigger digital presence. I honestly don't know what we're going to do in that state in the future. Whatever Yellow Dog Democrats there were even as recently as 2012 are now gone, and Little Dixie's about as red as Dixie is now. Really does show what a good candidate Kander was in 2016 that he even got that close to begin with."
politics,"To be fair, I don't think most Republicans believe Tara Reade either. They just want to push the story out of revenge for what happened to Kavanaugh and to use this to say that Democrats are hypocrites."
politics,"That's true, and it's something Biden needs to be accountable for, which he has been working on. But that isn't sexual assault. Biden grew up in a different era where showing personal affection like that was meant to be endearing. Here's the host of Family Feud ""greeting"" women contestants from the '80s:

https://twitter.com/Jwheels_74/status/1250903765131169795

He did get told to stop doing this by network execs though...but it was because he was kissing non-white women."
politics,"Nothing really happened on this story until Reade called her neighbor and got her to vouch for her and the Larry King clip. Until then, it was her brother changing his story to say that she told him about this when it happened (as opposed to recently, which is what he had said before), and two anonymous friends, only one of which claimed to have been told contemporaneously."
politics,"They care less about Tara Reade than the prospect of forcing Biden to release his UDel archive, which it stands to reason would be probably the least likely place for a complaint to be housed, but it would give them and the Republicans a chance to go on a fishing expedition to take things out of context. I mean, John Podesta's risotto recipe and some ""spirit cooking"" email were used to say that Clinton was a satanist - it's very reasonable not to want archives to be opened up over something as baseless as this."
politics,"Biden has 7 women accusing him of personal space issues and one accusing him of rape whose story is falling apart by the minute. None of the 7 women from last year allege it was sexual (Lucy Flores made it clear she did not feel it was sexual), and [here's one of them](https://twitter.com/Lappos/status/1256772801349943296) saying she'll support Biden."
politics,"https://twitter.com/tylerpager/status/1257459445824720901

This is in response to questions that Biden sent over this morning:

https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1257344377065742338"
politics,"She may not have been aware she could do it, since it seems like Biden's team didn't know they couldn't do it this way. Could be a way for her to start a ""legal defense fund"" to try and sue for them. The senate secretary says that their legal counsel does not believe there are any exceptions for either of the parties to disclose the complaint though."
politics,Made public while he was still likely going to be alive too.
politics,"She's saying that Biden's staff may have had notes about the incident and like, how to handle it. And those notes would somehow be in this archive that Biden voluntarily donated to secure his legacy. People are treating these UDel archives like they're some kind of sealed records required under law - they aren't. Biden's probably already pruned them of anything that could've been embarrassing or bad, because the whole thing is supposed to make him look good. This only works if you assume that his team somehow slipped the pages into the archive and no one saw them, or that Biden had some kind of desire to ruin his reputation and deliberately kept them in the files.

Plus, look at how the Senate secretary responded to Biden today. They rebuffed his attempt to get disclosure of this complaint and said that they had no discretion to release it or even the existence of a complaint. This makes sense. If you go to HR to complain about your boss, you don't want HR to be telling your boss that you did it, even many years later (whether that always happens is a different issue). If the Senate wouldn't even tell him _today_ whether there was a complaint made, why in the heck would he have a copy of it back when it happened?"
politics,"If the incumbent president were to make all of his financial records public information, there would certainly be a push for Biden to do the same with these UDel papers."
politics,"No, the Delaware records are the Benghazi. They're trying to find something in them that will turn into email-gate, much like how the only thing that came out of Benghazi was that they found out Clinton had an email server."
VoteDEM,"This is a dark horse race for sure. Alaska's major industries have all been hit hard by COVID (oil prices have collapsed, the tourism industry is going to be weak this summer, and it's been an unusually warm year for fisheries), so there may be a lot more anger than what we're used to seeing."
VoteDEM,"This is why I don't think Iowa is hopeless. It's currently in a tier of Senate seats that will flip in a landslide (along with MT and one or more of the GA seats), but this class of Senators has been exposed to two wave elections where something like 7-8 of the seats flip."
politics,Wonder what that's going to look like as he pushes states to reopen.
politics,"What's dumb is that blue states tend to rely on income taxes for more of their revenue than red states, which rely on sales taxes. Both are taking a huge beating right now, but sales taxes have fallen off a cliff."
politics,"Over 0.1% of the entire population of New York state has already died from this, and that isn't even using probable COVID deaths. New Jersey and Connecticut getting close as well. If literally no one else died from this virus in that area, the fatality rate in New York assuming a 15-20% infection rate based on their antibody testing would make this over 6 times worse than the worst flu season on record, and that was with massive social distancing and a lockdown. Governors saved lives making the tough call to shut down their states, all while the Commander in Chief did nothing but watch on the sidelines hoping to swoop in to take credit for anything that went right, and to blame the Governors for anything that went wrong."
politics,Who else on their bench could've been stronger? Whitmer won pretty convincingly.
VoteDEM,He just...doesn't seem like someone who's cut out for Congress. He was tweeting about being radicalized by Avatar and Wall-E the other day and he's somehow burned more money than the other candidates in the race.
VoteDEM,"He put up a good fight, but literally every Democrat had to vote in that special election and he barely won. Jones got more votes in some cities than Clinton did."
VoteDEM,"Keep in mind that NC doesn't have a gubernatorial veto to redistricting, so Cooper winning this year won't help if the Republicans try to fuck with the maps again next year, though it may end up in the courts. It would be a lot easier if the state house flipped though."
politics,"And lest anyone think the Rose Twitter folks actually care about these women, [here's one of the women](https://twitter.com/Lappos/status/1256772801349943296) who accused Biden last year of inappropriate handsiness being attacked by Twitterati for not speaking out enough during the primary because she happens to support Biden now."
politics,"She beat the state Attorney General, who won a primary over the state Lieutenant Governor at the time. He was not a weak opponent, there was no one else on the Republican bench who could've done better."
politics,"She saw this happen, but apparently didn't use this against Biden in 2008 when she was running against him? She probably would not have won but it would've been something to try and change the trajectory of that race."
politics,"They didn't want to. The author who pushed this tried to push an old article from 2008 with a throwaway line alleging Biden assaulted a woman in the Senate a week after his first wife died, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever (Biden was not a Senator at the time, he was in the hospital taking care of his boys, and the Senate would've been in recess since it was the week of Christmas). The guy's a total hack and he clearly has no reputation to protect, so the goal was just to lob another accusation to hope that the fringe left and the Republicans would run with it for clicks."
politics,"They aren't even saying that he only missed one year. He evidently missed the one in 2007 too since he was in Iowa. She made such a specific case that it was 2008 too which was why it was seen as such a strong accusation to begin with.

This is probably why Reade won't give a day in '93 either, because Biden probably has a record of what he was doing that day. There was a Twitter thread about how she specifically said she wasn't wearing underwear or panty hose that day, which she believed was in April, and someone checked the weather in DC, showing that the only day where the temperature was supposed to be above 55 degrees was April 20, 1993, where Biden had a pretty airtight alibi."
politics,"That lasted all of a couple hours. Apparently Biden wasn't even in Delaware that day:

What has society come to if we can't even trust the good word of anti-masturbation activist and non-practicing witch Christine O'Donnell?!"
politics,"Yeah, there's a danger to responding to all of these complaints and legitimizing them, because it seems like the grifter types are taking notes on what did and didn't work to try again. This one has a specific date and time, as well as contemporaneous corroborators, which were key weaknesses in Reade's allegation. The author of the piece even emphasized these since he was humiliated last week on Twitter when he pushed a thoroughly debunked piece from 2008 to prove Biden was a rapist. 

In the next iteration of this, they'll figure out to check Biden's alibi for the day to the extent they're able to, and just make it harder for the campaign to prove a negative."
politics,"Yeah, the specificity of the date and time and the number of contemporaneous corroborators attesting to it were meant to overcome some of the weaknesses that the Reade allegation has. That's been substantially undermined now. As long as Murry doesn't specifically admit it wasn't true, the story will linger for fringe groups to try and raise, but the press seems inclined to move on from this."
politics,"And when it doesn't show up, let that be the end of this."
politics,"Well we don't know what she's describing, because she's changed her story many times. And it also doesn't address the inconsistency with what she told the AP last year where she said she didn't file a complaint at all:

>Reade described the report after the AP discovered additional transcripts and notes from its interviews with Reade last year in which she says she “chickened out” after going to the Senate personnel office. 

Biden's called her bluff - his letter to the Senate secretary doesn't just cover a specific sexual harassment allegation, but anything related to Reade that could've been in any Senate archive, so if she made this claim about being ""uncomfortable"", that'd come out of this search as well."
politics,"Your tweet doesn't say she didn't use the words ""sexual assault"" or ""sexual harassment"", it's saying she didn't specifically accuse him of sexual assault or sexual harassment, which is directly contradicted by what Tara tweeted earlier. Biden called her bluff and this is all falling apart for her."
politics,"[My source is also Tara Reade](https://twitter.com/ReadeAlexandra/status/1235670257445957632):

>I worked for Joe Biden.in the Senate. **I filed a sexual harrassment & worse complaint against him in 93**. I was fired and threatened. I spoke up last April, this happened. My whole account never made public I have been silenced again 

Which Tara are you talking about?"
politics,"This is why Biden had to take his time to respond. He clearly values not destroying the MeToo movement, which is why his surrogates held their fire until now over some pretty glaring inconsistencies with Reade, including some damning character issues that should've given most people significant pause. 

By making it so that he wants an investigation into the one piece of the story he can vet, he's also making it harder for Trump to touch it, which is why they seem to be tiptoeing around the situation or defaulting to ~~but her emails~~ the UDel archives story."
politics,"The same ""reporter"" last week was pushing a conspiracy on Twitter that a 12 year old Counterpunch article that had a throwaway line about how Biden had sexually assaulted a woman on the Senate floor a week after his first wife had died. When people pointed out how that would be practically impossible (Biden's wife died a week before Christmas, when the Senate was no longer in session, he wasn't a Senator at the time yet, and he was very publicly committed to staying with his surviving children in the hospital, at one point planning to resign his seat), the guy called someone at Counterpunch who ""confirmed"" that this was a typo and it should have read ""weeks after"" to give him more wiggle room. Of course, the author of the article, Alexander Cockburn, died 8 years ago, so one wonders how they were able to correct that in an hour or two. 

This isn't a credible story, and Biden shouldn't have to instantly defend every attempt by shoddy glorified bloggers to have him prove a negative, which would only encourage more people to do this. Better to let these people who seem more interested in trying to take him down than actually ethically reporting news get exposed for the frauds that they are."
politics,"[In her own words] (https://twitter.com/ReadeAlexandra/status/1221635728884371456?s=20) back in January:

>Standing in our own truth is hard and at times lonely. However, the truth will come to the surface. **My story had witnesses and is in the National Archives,** it has yet to be fully told. Please read RT "" Lead, follow or get out of the way."" Thomas Paine

And again in the [beginning of March](https://twitter.com/ReadeAlexandra/status/1235670257445957632):

>I worked for Joe  Biden.in the Senate. **I filed a sexual harrassment & worse complaint against him in 93.** I was fired and threatened. I spoke up last April, this happened. My whole account never made public I have been silenced again"
politics,"Both Clinton and Trump had these accusations come out in their first national elections (well, except for Lewinsky for obvious reasons). This is Biden's third. An accusation of this magnitude would have seriously damaged the Democratic ticket, possibly even forcing Biden to step down as running-mate. When that happened in 1972, McGovern was blown out of the water. And for it to be literally verifiable through a formal Senate complaint is very different from digging up that a VP nominee had secretly been hospitalized for severe depression like Eagleton was."
politics,"No one would've been looking for blackface until recently, that wouldn't be true of assault. If you want to make the claim that Biden, in the '80s, secretly went outside at night in his neighborhood licking lamp posts, then yeah, I don't think the vetting team would necessarily catch something like that. But a formal complaint in the Senate over sexual misconduct and digital rape is very different, and something that would have been looked at, given how career-ending this kind of thing is."
politics,"Even a former RNC Comms Director from 2008 is saying [this never showed up in their oppo research](https://twitter.com/LizMair/status/1256383173929377799). For the RNC to just sit on something this explosive not only in 2008 but also 2012 (where something like this could easily have sunk the Obama ticket) is just unthinkable, and they definitely had the oppo research budget to try and do something like this. 

And this is a common enough issue that a vetting team would likely look into it. Hell, months before this encounter is said to have taken place, WaPo broke a story about [then-Senator Bob Packwood](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/27/566096392/when-bob-packwood-was-nearly-expelled-from-the-senate-for-sexual-misconduct) for sexual assault and was nearly expelled from the Senate for behavior that coincidentally is similar to what Reade is alleging. This isn't finding out that there was an old yearbook out there with Biden in blackface or that he has some weird sexual kink, rape is something that has derailed politicians before and definitely would've been something to look out for. For a formal complaint to be out there and for a vetting team not to find it is just hard to imagine."
politics,"Yeah I don't understand the logic of this line of attack. These would be personal papers about his thoughts and his positions on issues from like decades ago. For these to hold Reade's complaint would mean that the only copy of a complaint against him was...given to him, and he held onto it for sentimental reasons long enough for it to be part of the papers that he gifted to the school."
politics,Ford's complaint literally came out of the Senate judiciary committee's vetting.
politics,"This actually makes the numbers look even worse, because he didn't crack a net worth of $1million until likely he was done being VP. In 2008, he was one of the poorest Senators in the Senate with a net worth under $300K including the value of his home, which is how he got the whole ""middle class Joe"" moniker in the first place."
politics,"He was also famously one of the poorest Senators in the Senate at the time, with an assessed net worth of between -$308K and $280K in 2008: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2008/aug/27/howard-dean/we-should-all-be-so-poor/

Most of his wealth came after his stint as VP."
politics,"And if you don't believe Axelrod, this is the former RNC comms director from 2008 saying she also didn't surface something like this, which would've undoubtedly been used to tank the Democratic ticket if they had found it:

https://twitter.com/LizMair/status/1256383173929377799"
politics,"These aren't comparable situations. Northam's blackface came up in a yearbook that people probably hadn't cracked open in decades. If this formal complaint existed, it would've been in an official senate archive that the vetting team would've looked at or had access to. This is a fairly standard question to be checking for, unlike checking for whether someone did blackface in grad school.

Also, Northam was the top of the ticket for his race - the vetting fell on his opponents in the primary and general elections. For a VP, that vetting would've been both internal and external. And the budgets just don't compare at all. Ed Gillespie raised $24.5 million to try and beat Northam in 2017, about 7% of what McCain raised and 5% of what Romney raised."
politics,Colin Kalmbach seems to be trying to one-up her. He's already got another (verbal) sexual assault claim going in an article after his attempt to revive a 12 year old article claiming Biden assaulted someone a week (or weeks) after his first wife died over the weekend failed miserably.
politics,She's supposedly going on with Chris Wallace soon. CBS is trying to set something up too.
politics,I mean that's where her Rising co-host came from. No idea how Krystal Ball suddenly blew up this year to be honest.
politics,"Ford also didn't want to initially come forward with her claim. The Intercept pretty much forced her to do it when they broke that Feinstein was sitting on the allegation (out of respect for Ford) when they were investigating Kavanaugh. And Ford testified under oath while also naming people at the scene. Even Kavanaugh had to concede that the party she remembered had happened in his calendars.

Reade can't tell us when this happened, which makes it impossible for Biden to produce an alibi. She's changed her story many times, to the point where her reasons for leaving DC have ranged from being raped (the present allegation) to being disgusted with reckless US imperialism because she loved Russia with all her heart. Even this morning, she's now no longer saying she filed a formal assault complaint, only saying that she told the office that Biden made her feel uncomfortable. 

These are just not the same situation. When Reade came out with her allegations, the Biden team denied it, but they didn't attack her. She had her opportunity to tell her story and the press has had its opportunity to diligence it. People have been sympathetic to hearing her story even as the inconsistencies in it continue to mount."
politics,"Ryan Grimm from the Intercept has stated that Tara told him that she didn't come forward in 2008 because she had a young daughter at the time and had respect for Obama. Of course, that doesn't explain why she didn't come forward with this in 2019 when she alleged Biden was being too handsy. She blames the reporter for not asking her that question."
politics,"She's apparently no longer claiming she filed a formal assault complaint, only that she had told the office that Biden had made her feel uncomfortable: https://twitter.com/marykbruce/status/1256197317235027968"
politics,"Kavanaugh's accuser didn't want to go on record, so she wasn't waiting until the confirmation to do it. The Intercept leaked it somehow that Feinstein was sitting on a sexual assault allegation which set that into motion."
politics,"The initial reporting was that she made a formal assault complaint. This is a tweet from a reporter this morning that she's now saying she had told the office that Biden had made her feel uncomfortable but didn't mention assault:

politics,"The average age of Senators is 62. 6 are 80 or older and 22 of them are 70 or older. If the Senate can't even get enough testing to safely reopen, I'm not sure what Georgia is doing at all other than forcing businesses to fail (because restaurants and hair parlors aren't designed to operate at 25% capacity, assuming people even dine in at all) and people off UI."
politics,"Florida isn't looking to be the tipping point state this year, it's currently either Wisconsin or Arizona. A win in Florida for Biden would effectively foreclose pretty much any reasonable possibility of Trump winning, but it's such an intractable state (we thought it was bluish because Rick Scott only won by 0.1% in 2010 and 2014, which were Republican wave years...then Scott won by 0.1% in 2018, which was a very good Democratic wave year) that it'll come down to turnout more than anything else. I don't think either campaign would feel very safe if they were relying on Florida to get them to 270."
politics,"While there are some folks like Nate Cohn who push the belief that a 4 point popular vote win would still potentially yield a Trump electoral win, it's just hard to see right now in the polling of swing states which is also showing Trump collapsing. And Biden's also winning by 6 in a lot of these polls."
politics,"Yeah, he's been able to get out of minor controversies as long as the economy kept humming and people felt safe. That's a superpower in its own right for a normal administration. It relied on him saying something else that was outrageous and wearing out the media and the public so they stopped caring. We've seen that his polling numbers are stable so long as it's about his personality, but when it came to things like health care repeal and the shutdown, his numbers took nosedives.

The economic pain from how poorly coronavirus has been handled is going to make health care repeal and the shutdown look small fries. It hasn't even begun to get priced in yet, and when he's confronted with a problem that isn't of his own doing, Trump has repeatedly shown very little aptitude to handle things appropriately."
politics,"I mean, the stories coming from the White House really make it seem like they're dealing with a toddler. His strategists knew that his press conferences were not helping his reelection and desperately wanted him to stop, but they were overruled because it was therapeutic for him to be able to keep doing them. It's amazing that he's literally flooding the zone in a way that incumbents usually can only dream of having the ability to do, but it's doing so much harm to him right now."
politics,"It’s somewhat reassuring to me that a lot of these polls also show that most people think Trump will win. Democrats have a Goldilocks zone between being utterly distraught and hopeless and being too overconfident which is when they have the best chance of getting turnout up. Few people seem to think Trump’s going down for sure this time, even though these numbers are just utterly terrible for an incumbent president.
