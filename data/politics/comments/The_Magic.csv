CFB,The threat was made in August after a rental mansion was repeatedly used for huge parties.
CFB,This will be the dumbest PAC-12 CCG since 2011.
CFB,Words cannot describe how disappointed I am that we aren't scheduled.
CFB,I wish we could consistently play good throughout an entire game instead of coasting until the final minutes.
California,I think hippies are more associated with San Francisco and Berkeley which have a history of attract more progressive people.  Personally I don't hear hella much in SoCal unless someone is being ironic but that could just be the circles I hang out in.
California,Its noticeably cooler if you're from LA but it gets exaggerated.
California,"I don't know about that.   The Bay is responsible for ""hella"" and the hippy stereotypes."
CFB,Helton is mediocre but has amazing players.
CFB,Delete This
CFB,These games always get feisty.
CFB,What even was his deal?
CFB,Berkeley's fight song > UCLA's fight song.
CFB,That loss was vacated so it never happened.
CFB,It worked with Reggie.
CFB,Any idea what his current position is?
CFB,I'm happy that Neuheisel's kid is still working with UCLA.
CFB,He got hurt and Slovis balled out the rest of the season.  I don't blame the coaches for deciding to stick with Kedon but the whole situation sucked.
CFB,This is why a four team playoff dictated by an arbitrary committee is stupid.   We need a bigger playoff with automatic entries for P5 conference champions.
CFB,I'm really happy that JT seems to be doing great at Georgia.   I really thought he was looking good at USC before he got hurt and lost his spot.
SquaredCircle,There used to be a great highlight reel on YouTube of Scott Steiner from the pre pumped years.   Dude was probably the most athletic wrestler of that era.
tuesday,I am pretty sure this will qualify as an illegal order so the military will not comply.

nfl,What would you say the biggest reason is?
worldnews,Th problem with a two state solution is that The West Bank and Gaza Strip are not connected which makes it difficult to be a functioning state.
JoeBiden,"I can’t recall a previous time where they had a joint entry for the POTUS and VP.  Any idea why they broke precedent for Kamala?   I’m not complaining, just a little surprised."

AskReddit,I do not believe he ever met any of these people in person.   This was a purely over the internet relationship.

tuesday,If we could befriend Japan after Pearl Harbor then we could work with Vietnam to contain China.
tuesday,The sentiment is historically rooted in [Imperial China's expansionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_imperialism) but modern China is claiming [much of their neighbor's waters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/South_China_Sea_claims_map.jpg/420px-South_China_Sea_claims_map.jpg).
tuesday,Hopefully the incoming administration can pass TPP and create a Pacific NATO in order to contain China and make them play by our rules.  One thing we have going for us is that all of China's neighbors hate them.
AskReddit,Is your father still denying everything?  Also how did your mom take the news?
AskReddit,He said the woman would send her daughter’s pictures.
tuesday,He announced his candidacy with a rant about how Mexicans that cross the border are rapists and murderers even though he assumes some must be nice people.
neoliberal,I remember at the time a lot of Republicans said Huntsman came off as arrogant for speaking some Mandarin in a debate about what America's policy should be towards China.  Those people were salty that Huntsman came off as the most knowledgeable person on that subject.
vtmb,They promised the extra clans will be free anyway so I don't mind waiting.
movies,I totally understand the issues with the rights but in my head all of these characters still exist in a shared universe so this will always be their definitive Christmas special.
movies,Give me 4k Muppet Family Christmas or give me death!
Games,I love these games but I don't see an official remaster happening.  EA no longer has a license to make LotR games and Warner Bros has been making their own games set in Tolkien's world.
Games,I think the big hold up is that LucasFilm probably wants to create a canon aesthetic for that period.  I love those games but it was annoying how everything looked similar to the OT when it was set thousands of years earlier.
starwarsspeculation,"I think pretty soon EA is going to milk as much Jedi potential between the trilogies that Lucasfilm will allow.  Lucasfilm as been pumping out a new time period known as ""The High Republic"" which looks like it will be a good sandbox for future games."
starwarsspeculation,I was surprised by how well Beskar holds its own against lightsabers this season.   Especially because the only reason the Darksaber exists is because George didn't like having a vibroblade hold its own against a lightsaber.
CFB,Which is why having an arbitrary committee determine who makes the playoff is dumb.
Games,"I see a lot of people saying that Mitsoda does not know why he was fired but if you read his statement he says he was surprised by his firing and does not believe it was warranted.   That is very different from not knowing why he was fired.  

I understand a lot of fans being concerned about the game but its odd how the community went from dooming about the dev team dropping the ball before the firings to dooming over Paradox ruining it  after they changed the leadership."
worldnews,Because aliens are a great distraction.
Games,The ex-Ubisoft guy runs a consulting company that helps out with troubled game developments.   VTMB2 missed several deadlines and the action did not look good so paying this guy to take over shows that they're invested in saving this game.
nfl,He showed a lot of promise his rookie year.  In college he was at his best when he would roll out to extend the play but Gase seems to have coached that out of him which turned Sam into a mediocre pocket passer.
starwarsspeculation,It is.  George liked the design so much he added it to the background of New hope.
starwarsspeculation,Now would be a good time to bring back The Outrider.
movies,"The TV cut of Snakes on a Plane has Samuel L Jackson say [""I have had it with these monkey fighting snakes on this Monday to Friday plane!""](https://youtu.be/z4t6zNZ-b0A)"
politics,The only somewhat realistic Hail Mary left for Trump is for a bunch of faithless electors to vote for him on December 14th.   I seriously doubt this will happen but its possible.
StarWarsLeaks,Wookiepedia says Boba was born in 32 BBY.   The Mandalorian is set 9 ABY which would put him closer to 41.   But Star Wars's timeline is sometimes wibbly wobbly.
StarWarsLeaks,Is that how it currently works?   I thought Clone Wars had some line about Maul being a Zabrak was a misunderstanding.  Also I thought female Zabraks had horns while the female Dathomirians had none.
StarWarsEU,Maybe he has more respect for Mandalorians.
StarWarsEU,We don't know much about these dark trooper so I'm going to just assume they're a different variant.
StarWarsEU,It definitely looks like they're setting up for a Thrawn invasion.   It will be interesting how that story is told since an invasion like that would warrant involvement from some OT characters but the surviving actors are way too old.
starwarsspeculation,I've always been under the impression that Slave 1 is a bit cramped inside.  I think Mando is going to have a ship that will make for an easier film set.
starwarsspeculation,I believe he's digital every time they show him walking.
StarWarsLeaks,There were rumors about him directing an episode awhile ago but he's since denied it.   He's slated to direct a new Indiana Jones movie so I don't blame him for pulling out of an episode to take that opportunity.
StarWarsLeaks,The weird thing about Boba Fett is that he's only supposed to be around 41 during The Mandalorian.   I guess being eaten by a sarlacc and living on a planet with two suns is not good your skin.
StarWarsLeaks,Darth Maul was originally supposed to be a Zabrak but the Clone Wars cartoon changed it to Dathomirian.
TheMandalorianTV,"He was one of the more prominent Jedi in the old EU books so he wasn’t just in the games.  Kyle was on my mind since the Dark Troopers were from the Dark Forces game which just so happened to be Kyle’s debut.  

Finally, we don’t know of many active Jedi at 9 ABY to answer Baby Yoda’s call.  Ezra is presumably imprisoned, Ahsoka doesn’t want to train him, Cal is being used by EA, and Mark Hamill is too old to play Luke and I doubt the show has the budget to de-age him.  So there’s room for a Jedi trained by Luke to come to the rescue.  Since Kyle would be trained as an adult he would not be opposed to having Grogu trained."
TheMandalorianTV,I hope this all leads to Kyle Katarn answering The Child’s call for help.
bipartisanship,Imagine not being Catholic
bipartisanship,Anything is possible with Trump.
nfl,Going back to his time at USC Sam was at his best when he rolled out of the pocket to extend the play.   He did that a lot his rookie year but has been doing that significantly less every year since.   I really think this is due to Gase trying to change the type of QB Sam is than the defense scaring him from rolling out.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,How is 15?   I've been curious about it after hearing Woolie and Pat talk about it but I've seen a lot of hate towards it in other subs.
videos,"Man, it really sucked that Rosie O'Donnell was the host every year when I was a kid."
nfl,Sam showed some promise his rookie year where the old coaching staff at least tried to adjust the offense to his strengths.   Gase has been forcing his system on Sam and it doesn't work.
SquaredCircle,Arn has been in his 50s for 40 years now.
SquaredCircle,I hope they sell some merchandise with his classic scorpion logo.
videos,I hope all these Jonathan Frakes memes leads to Beyond Belief getting put on Netflix.   That show was so much fun.
StarWarsLeaks,If you don't feel like watching every episode you can [use this guide](https://i.imgur.com/suvAMuYg.jpg).
StarWarsLeaks,I hope not.   I prefer The Force is left vague and hate how they tried to explain it in that arc.
StarWarsLeaks,[This](https://i.imgur.com/suvAMuYg.jpg) is the best episode guide I've seen so far.
SquaredCircle,Skip to around 58 minutes if you want to see her reaction to Sting.
SquaredCircle,DDP stalking Taker's wife made zero sense since he was married to a fucking Nitro Girl at the time.
SquaredCircle,Sting also has Seek and Destroy
TwoBestFriendsPlay,"I don't think a pure JJ trilogy would have been great but I think it would have been fine.   With TFA he worked with Laurence Kasdan to develop the story which just so happened to be a pseudo retelling of ANH.  The final act of RoS also has a lot of parallels with RotJ.   

A pure JJ trilogy would probably be pretty predictable but I think if he was forced to deliver on some of his mysteries he would have handled it better than Rian.   For example: I suspect JJ would have just made Snoke Plagueis instead of unceremoniously killing him off."
freefolk,Solo was alright.
freefolk,I think people that say that are fans of the Clone Wars cartoon that actually has some good writing and adds depth to the characters.
freefolk,The Prequel story as told in the movies does not make much sense.   7 seasons of a TV show managed to fill things in and add a lot of depth which retroactively fixed a lot of things but George's movies were a storytelling abortion.
freefolk,The first few seasons had original scenes that added depth to characters (Bobby B and Cersei discussion their marriage and Arya   serving Tywin come to mind).   But their original stuff that had plot significance was complete garbage.
freefolk,Just like how Loras Tyrell went from being a strong knight who just so happens to be gay to just being a gay fuckboy that plays knight from time to time.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,"JJ's Star Trek reboot was basically a Star Wars movie so he looked like the safest choice.   I remember even Plinket said that if there was ever going to be a new Star Wars JJ would be the guy.   

I think a pure JJ trilogy or pure Johnson trilogy could have worked but the movies definitely feel like they were fighting each other."
tuesday,Your classmate and David Cage should form a support group.
MMA,There's a reason I specified top sambo talent.   I would be disappointed in you but you made it clear from the beginning that reading comprehension is not your strong suit.
videos,A similar event took place in the Florida area.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,Kathleen Kennedy is a talented producer but has spent her career letting creative people do their thing (which makes sense since she worked with Spielberg and Lucas).   When it came time for the Sequels she again deferred to the directors but because the directors were not on the same page it led to whiplash.  As the head of Lucasfilm she should have pulled rank and at least have everyone agree to some bullet points.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,I’ve been thinking of just watching the first three seasons sometime and just pretending that Tywin and Roose lived happily ever after.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,They can go by Kali.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,Say what you want about Roose but he knew how to keep the peace.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,Turok selflessly saved the world from dinosaurs.  The most famous Khaleesi was a war criminal.
movies,Its been a long time since I’ve seen this pasta.
MMA,"I am aware of the ADCC but the Olympics will bring a lot of attention to the sport you goof.  The amateur wrestling community has global tournaments every year but the Olympics is when they get exposure.  

And since you are an expert on ADCC and all things submission grappling you are probably aware that most of the top sambo guys don’t take part in ADCC and instead just stick to the sambo tournaments.  An Olympic tournament could probably attract a lot of those guys which could lead to some exciting matchups."
vtmb,What scare was that?
vtmb,I've never noticed a difference there when I played a Malk.
vtmb,I believe the UP restored Jack calling the player out.   Maybe one of the backgrounds gives you an extra skill point than would be possible in vanilla.
MMA,"I've heard of there being a lot of crossover between wrestling, BJJ, and Judo but I've been under the impression of Sambo community mostly staying to themselves.   I'd love to see a tournament that brings out a lot of the top Sambo talent to roll with the BJJ and wrestling guys."
MMA,Mark Kerr won a couple ADCC tournaments with his amateur wrestling and some submission he learned from Bas Rutten.  The sweet spot would be setting rules that attract both Sambo and BJJ grapplers.   ADCC is great but they mostly attract guys from the no gi BJJ community.
MMA,Yes but doing it at the Olympics would bring a lot more attention to the sport.
MMA,A broad submission grappling tournament that could bring in everything from sambo to BJJ would be pretty cool.
movies,That’s pretty tame as far as age gaps in Hollywood movies go.
movies,8 Crazy Nights cannot be the worst because The Hebrew Hammer exists.
movies,I was disappointed that there was no conquering involved.
movies,I get that but its weird that I can watch Fellowship in 24 FPS and the props in Bag End look real but upping the frame rate in Hobbit made everything look cheap.
SquaredCircle,I’ve been waiting for AJ and The Good Brothers vs The Elite.   Kenny needs his comeuppance for what he did to AJ.
SquaredCircle,They didn’t but they wrestled at an indie show in Winnipeg.  Kenny has said he was planning on retiring when he was offered that match and wrestling AJ reinvigorated his love of wrestling.
SquaredCircle,"Were you in the production booth in 2008 when Regal took Raw off the air mid match? If so what was it like having the production team having to play a part on tv?   

Assuming you had some hand it editing the Battle of the Billionaires storyline, have you ever thought about how weird it is that something you had a hand in will be in political and historical documentaries?   

Finally who on the current roster is your favorite to watch?"
SquaredCircle,What was the original question?   OP deleted his comment so i have no idea what hibps is responding to.
SquaredCircle,I assume broadcast coverage since matches are put together by the werestlers and agents.
movies,"Its weird, I'm not an expert with framerates but all the props looked plastic and fake."
SquaredCircle,They could at least make the Raw vs SD Survivor Series match have some kind of implications for the Royal Rumble.
nyjets,The issue is that Gase has been forcing Darnold to play his offense instead of making an offense that plays to Sam's strengths.   I do not think it is a coincidence that Sam's best year was his rookie year where he played for a staff that scouted him and knew what he was good at.
nyjets,"Most Division 1 QBs won't work in the NFL.  USC gets a lot of attention because they play in Los Angeles and until recently had a more Pro-Style offense which looks good to recruiters.  If you analyze each USC QB on their own they all had different issues and different coaches around them (Leinart never had a strong arm and had maturity issues, Matt Cassell never started a game, JDB had feet made of concrete, Sanchez liked partying, Barkley got hurt his senior year, Kessler doesn't like throwing the ball deep, and Darnold likes playing hero ball)."
CFB,I can never root for Mater Dei but I appreciate what they do for USC.
tuesday,"My bad, I completely misread that.  The rest of the senate Republicans seem to like Lindsey so I believe he could make a good run at being the majority/minority leader whenever Mitch steps down.   

I through Charlie's name out there since he's a prominent Republican that hasn't dabbled in Trumpism.   I would support any Republican that pulls us back into being boring."

SquaredCircle,Any steak cooked that long will taste the same.   If you are eating somewhere nice it is recommended you order a steak in a way that lets the chef show off what he is being paid for.
Games,The Sequels are canon so they're working within the canon that exists.  It makes sense for the Imperial Remnants in the time of Mando to somehow morph into the First Order.   The show also needs a motive for the Imperials to want to steal a force sensitive child.  If we ignore the Sequels it would be weird since Palpatine is dead.   The twists in the Sequels provide a motive that the audience would be familiar with.
Games,Pikachu zapped some missiles that were targeting Porygon along with Ash and some other Pokemon.
Games,Is that actually a standalone game?  I thought it was just a DLC pack.
SquaredCircle,ECW was great but it was on regional television at weird hours.  WCW was on primetime cable.
SquaredCircle,"At the time I was frustrated because Kevin Owens was a cocky ""prize fighter"" until he was handed the belt and suddenly became a chickenshit heel."
Games,This season of The Mandalorian feels like its planting a lot of seeds for spinoffs.  I'm guessing Disney is well aware of the response to the Sequels and is going to use The Mandalorian for their new foundation.
Games,"I would also throw in Republic Commando, Empire at War, and the Rogue Squadron games as good Star Wars games of that era.   I think one reason that time is fondly remembered is because so many Star Wars games came out in a relatively short period of time that covered many different genres. 

 Today we only get a new Star Wars game every couple years.   As somebody who prefers single player games Fallen Order was the only one I really enjoyed (I haven't tried Squadrons yet)."
Games,I prefer the old approach of a lot of content with some gems and garbage to shift through over EA putting out one Star Wars game every few years.
Games,I give it a solid A.   It would be an A+ in my book if it had co-op.
news,"Where did I ever say the Church was perfect and did not have a problem with misogyny or pedophilia?   All I did was point out how misinformed you are about the Catholic Church’s history with black people.  

The amount of projecting you are currently exhibiting coupled with your aversion Google and inability to admit you are wrong makes it abundantly clear that you are the one at fault.  

I am sorry you are so bad at this.  Maybe you can read some books in the future."

news,"There have been [numerous Cardinals from Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:African_cardinals).  It is a major reach to say they are systematically racist against black people when they have a history of appointing Cardinals from Africa. 

Don’t feel bad, not everyone has to know what they’re talking about."
news,Bishops are selected by the Vatican so I do not believe American racism played a significant role.  Also there are [quite a few](https://www.usccb.org/committees/african-american-affairs/african-american-bishops) African American bishops.  The U.S only has a few Cardinal Bishops at a time and since Rome has no problem appointing African Cardinals I doubt that they hate people with more melanin.

SquaredCircle,AJ gave notice.   When contract negotiations came up he made it clear that he was wanted to wrestle full time in the U.S.
AskReddit,What I find interesting is that after Jesus died his followers wrote down all of his quotes they could remember into “Sayings Gospels”.  These lists of quotes were later edited into the narrative Gospels that we are familiar with today.   Only [one of the Sayings Gospels has survived](https://www.marquette.edu/maqom/Gospel%20of%20Thomas%20Lambdin.pdf) with all of the supernatural stuff stripped away Jesus comes off as this wandering hippie or cult leader.
AskReddit,"Even in the U.S its a regional thing.  In rural areas or places where it snows shoes always come off indoors.  In the greater Los Angeles area (where a lot of TV and movies are filmed) there is no snow, everyone drives, and when people do walk outside its on pavement or concrete.  Combine this with easy to clean hard floors being more in fashion and you get a culture where nobody cares about shoes indoors."
AskReddit,Carbon capture gives us the capability to reverse things.
AskReddit,WWE’s construction was more shoddy in the 90s.  Throughout the match there are zip ties flying as they walk around the roof of the cell.  It was not a controlled environment so accidents were bound to happen.
AskReddit,Jesus was leading a Jewish reform movement which pissed off a lot of establishment Jews but I don’t believe he was leading a rebellion movement against Rome.   Hell there’s a part in the text wjere he tells people to pay their taxes.
AskReddit,Dude really hated gift shops.

nfl,Sad Tom Brady is the best Tom Brady.
Games,It only allows you to run UWP apps.   I do not believe there is a UWP version of Steam.
Games,Its probably worth it if its just going to collect dust anyway.   Emulator performance probably won't be as good as the Series S but I'm sure you can still run a lot of stuff fine.   There's videos of people running emulators on the XBOne so you can see if it runs well enough for you.
Games,Microsoft has their own in house emulator for running older games.  I don't think they are going to ever make it open source.   There are several Xbox emulator projects out there but for whatever reason progress has been very slow.
SquaredCircle,At Wrestlemania 8 The Undertaker became the first wrestler to kick out of Jake's DDT.  The first match of Wrestlemania 9 had Shawn using the DDT as a transitional move.  I love Shawn but he has no place to talk.

CFB,Slovis is playing with a jacked up elbow.   Darnold's problem in his sophomore year was due to losing all his starting receivers.   It took Helton half a season to realize that he should start the talented younger receivers over the upper class receivers that didn't know how to catch the ball.
CFB,Clay Helton is the Joe Flacco of college football.
CFB,lol its not going to happen.
CFB,We won't have to play in the cold again.

CFB,Utah is doing something where their players choose a word to put on their jerseys instead of their names.
CFB,Elbow is still jacked up from Iowa.
CFB,Probably related to his elbow injury from the Holiday Bowl
CFB,Every team in the PAC 12 hates us and is basically an unofficial rivalry game.
CFB,You and Colorado joined at the same time so it would make sense for you two to start a rivalry tradition.
CFB,It comes and goes.   I think we had it when Darnold was playing.
fighton,Looks like his elbow did not recover from the Holiday Bowl.
CFB,We would have lost our previous two games if we didn't have dramatic rallies in the last 3-5 minutes of the fourth quarter where we decided to play like mid 2000s USC again.   We aren't going to be back until we start playing like that somewhat consistently.
CFB,Who is getting the ball next half?
CFB,USC is winning thanks to turnovers.
CFB,Iowa jacked up his elbow in Holiday Bowl and he chose not to have surgery.
CFB,Iowa jacked up his elbow last season.   He opted not to have surgery but it does not look like it recovered well.
CFB,He jacked his elbow up in the bowl game last season and opted not to get surgery.   It looks like it hasn't healed as well as he hoped.
CFB,Slovis was really good last season but does not seem to have recovered from his elbow injury last season.   Before him JT Daniels was good but kept getting hurt.
CFB,I can see us winning the conference but there's no way this team deserves to be ranked in the top 4.
CFB,We had some good OLs during the Kiffin years.
CFB,It is probably his elbow injury from last season.
CFB,He opted not to get surgery after his elbow injury last season.   I'm going to withhold judgement on his NFL prospects until next season to see if a surgery will improve his game.
CFB,He jacked up his elbow in the bowl game last season.  He opted not to get surgery and its looking like that was not a good decision.
CFB,They're playing like its the last three minutes of the game.
CFB,What's with that big sheet of plastic behind the endzone?
CFB,Because Air Raid
CFB,JT was good he just kept getting hurt.
CFB,Our defense is really bailing us out this game.
CFB,He opted not to have elbow surgery in the offseason.   It looks like the injury is still bugging him and he will probably end up getting surgery anyway if he wants to keep his spot.
CFB,We've been having issues running down the middle all season.   For whatever reason every play now has to be from the shotgun which makes things harder on our RBs in obvious running situations.

neoliberal,I wrote a long comment here awhile back that had nothing to do with W but I had one line where I referred to his administration as competent.   That's when I learned that Reddit is still not ready to have a mature conversation about the W Bush administration.
SquaredCircle,He tweeted out [text screenshots.](https://twitter.com/TeamLouie/status/1329563175679897602)  Texts aren't hard to fake so take it with a grain of salt.
SquaredCircle,I'm a fan of NWA champions showing up in random promotions and being treated like a big deal since it reminds me of the territory days where Ric Flair would show up to a new territory and defend his title against the top face.
SquaredCircle,"WWE acknowledges former promotions that they own.   Outside of that they vaguely refer to promotions by where they're from (TNA=Florida, NJPW=Japan, any promotion outside of North America or Japan=""All around the world"", North American indies=Bingo Halls)."
SquaredCircle,I agree with Dave about Tessa's talent but I don't see any major promotion signing her until she works on herself.
SquaredCircle,WWE allegedly passed on signing her after her appearance in the Mae Young Classic due to her attitude in the locker room.
SquaredCircle,Jim Cornette once said on his podcast that Magnum wasn't much better than Tully in that regard.
vtmb,Paradox is not known for being particularly woke so if the game ends up having trigger warnings I doubt it came as a publisher mandate.  The most woke game in their library that I can think of is Battle Tech where the player can choose their pronouns but that looks like it was the developer's choice.
tuesday,It looks like they’re switching to a PG version recorded in the early 90s.
vtmb,I took that to mean he was surprised and found it unwarranted.
vtmb,I doubt Paradox ordered a massive rewrite at the 11th hour.  The HSL shakeup only came after several missed deadlines.   The last thing they would want is even longer development.
tuesday,Gavin comes off as a tool in his personal life but he at least vetoes the giga succs and proposes budgets that have a surplus.  As far as CA dems go we can easily do a lot worse.
tuesday,The sad thing is that he was nowhere close to the worst candidate that election.  He got through the primary with around a third of the vote and unfortunately the GOP nominated a Trumpy candidate.

tuesday,Really good show.   I love how Cornette still hates Vince Russo after all these years.   If you want an even deeper dive on the Benoit stuff I recommend the Lapsed Fan podcasts [three episodes on the tragedy](https://podbay.fm/p/the-lapsed-fan-wrestling-podcast/e/1498924285).   I'm pretty sure Darkside's producers used those as a guide but they barely touched the surface.   While the tragedy isn't Vince's fault he handled it significantly worse than I ever imagined.
tuesday,Everything could use more Shawn Michaels.
tuesday,Shep was my favorite anchor on Fox so I was sad to see him go.   His show was the only one that I would go out of my way to watch.

SquaredCircle,Ben Shapiro is a blowhard but I guess if we extend this analogy you're the 19 year old who crumbles after Ben cites publicly available information.
SquaredCircle,Lol I'm sorry that when the legal dictionary clearly states in plain English that a Not Guilty verdict is not the same thing as being found innocent.  That was the distinction I was making from the beginning and I am sorry this went completely over your head.   I am sure you will do better next time.
SquaredCircle,LMAO I'm sorry the dictionary disagrees with you.
SquaredCircle,"Black's Law Dictionary definition of not guilty verdict:

""Simply a verdict of not proven in the particular case tried; it is not a verdict of innocence, and hence is not conclusive against the state in favor of any other person than the defendant who was actually acquitted. Woody v. State, 10 Okl.Cr. 322, 136 P. 430, 432, 49 L.R.A.,N.S., 479.""

One can deserve the presumption of innocence without being proven innocent.   Being found Not Guilty is not proven innocence.   This is day one law class shit bro."
SquaredCircle,"Bro, its not like Black's Law Dictionary is easily citeable on the internet but it is clear that people smarter than you are making this distinction so in cases like this appeal to authority is totally valid, bro.

But if you want to check my work feel free to grab your uncle's copy of Black's where the definition of ""Not Guilty Verdict"" reads:

""Simply a verdict of not proven in the particular case tried; it is not a verdict of innocence, and hence is not conclusive against the state in favor
of any other person than the defendant who was
actually acquitted. Woody v. State, 10 Okl.Cr. 322,
136 P. 430, 432, 49 L.R.A.,N.S., 479.""

That was my point this entire time but congrats on splitting hairs that do not exist."

I am sorry you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about despite how passionate you are about this topic."
SquaredCircle,The only options in a jury trial are “Guilty” and “Not Guilty”.  In American courts innocence is presumed but never proven.
SquaredCircle,In the American legal system they most definitely mean two different things.  Innocent means that you did not commit the crime. Not Guilty means that there was not sufficient evidence to determine that you did commit the crime.
vtmb,I never thought about it before but I guess all the vampires in VTMB with modern haircuts have to style it every night.  It must get annoying.
LosAngeles,The senate made more sense when they were appointed instead of elected.  The idea was that the senate was where the state governments would have influence on the long term direction of the country and would be free of the populist whims of the masses.  By making senators directly elected they’re now just super congressmen and are redundant.

neoliberal,I could see that working with the left wing populists in the U.S but not the right wing populists right now.   While the left wing populists are concerned a lot about student debt and affordable healthcare right wing populists are mad about Mexicans existing and imaginary conspiracies.

neoliberal,Is there any proven playbook on how to kill populist movements?
tuesday,Nations have bounced back from worse than what Trump put us through over the last four years but it will take effort to fully recover.   I am optimistic but the growing populist movements are going to be a major hurdle.
neoconNWO,"If we are going to confront China in either trade or to curb their expansionism we will need cooperation from our western allies.   If Joe wants to resurrect TPP it is easier to negotiate trade with leaders that like you.   If we want to challenge China's claim's in the Pacific a joint NATO fleet holds more weight than just an American one.   

The EU has always been a bit of a mess but it is easier to get things done if we make it clear that we're friendly with them."
neoconNWO,That's the first I've heard about this.  Hopefully if Rice is made SoS she concentrates mostly on repairing relationships with our western allies and delegates Asia to someone else.
SquaredCircle,"That is true but courts in the U.S do not find people innocent, only not guilty.   ""Not guilty"" is not the same thing as being innocent."
SquaredCircle,Not Guilty =/= Innocent
neoconNWO,Joe is far from perfect but at least he will listen to advisors instead of his gut.  I'm not sure what Susan Rice's Middle East stances are but she has written a lot about how the U.S should have intervened in Darfur so its not like Biden is surrounding himself with doves.
movies,A full movie just about the Basterds doing stupid shit would have also been a very fun movie.
neoconNWO,Its odd since it looks like this will still leave some boots on the ground so it shouldn't be too difficult for Joe to scale it up again if he chooses too.
neoconNWO,"Looks like Trump is pushing through a [massive troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/us/politics/trump-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan-somalia-iraq.html)."

[Mass shootings have also become more common since Columbine](https://thesocietypages.org/feminist/files/2015/12/Mass-Shootings-Stanford-1.png).   A spike like this warrants some kind of response."
neoliberal,Its because they’re trying to curb mass shootings instead of the homicides.
neoliberal,I was pretty active in Ron Paul 2012 and in retrospect the Ron Paul internet community back then had a lot of similarities with the internet Trump community in 2016.  I think there might be something to Ron Paul being a dry run for Russian interference.   Especially since Ron got a cushy RT gig after retiring.

CFB,It is so frustrating that we only play like USC in the last few minutes of the game.
vtmb,This sub would be so dead if Jeanette was not such an easy thirst trap cosplay.
CFB,We are most definitely thirsty for Urban.   We have a new AD who publicly said that he's building a new Athletic Department that would attract a new coach whenever we're on the search for one.
CFB,Coaches set the culture.  There was a massive culture shift when we moved from Hackett to Carroll.   I'm confident there can be a similar shift if we move from Helton to a real coach.
CFB,Its been the story of the entire Helton era.   Its extremely frustrating.
tuesday,"Nixon was a competitive debater and knew how to turn the charisma on when he needed to.  He was definitely less charismatic than Kennedy but just about everyone in history looks uncharismatic next to JFK.

SquaredCircle,He was basically a space wrestler.
StarWars,In the first season they mentioned that the Covert only allows one of their members to be active at a time so Din probably has little to no experience fighting alongside other Mandalorians.
AskReddit,"There a lot of little things in Kotor canon that later contradicted George's canon (like Sith ghosts).   The Kotor aesthetic also contradicted Old Republics comics that predated those games.  It makes sense that if Disney goes back to that period they would want to have a canon look.  

As an aside Kevin Feige allegedly has a Star Wars project that he pitched to Bob Iger.   Something in my gut makes me think that it is KOTOR related."
AskReddit,"There was a reference to Revan in the Rise of Skywalker Visual Dictionary.  In Rebels there’s an episode where you see Malachor and there were still signs of a huge battle.  

I believe Disney is holding back from doing too much with the Old Republic right now because they want to reboot it to make it more visually distinct from the Original Trilogy time period.  They recently released a bunch of stuff in the “High Republic” period that’s only 200 years before New Hope but looks very different."
AskReddit,"Not the person you asked but I’ve been enjoying Outer Worlds for its character writing and being rewarded for finishing quests in less obvious ways.  It is also nice to play a “Bethesda like” game on the Unreal Engine.  

The biggest complaint I’ve seen is that it’s shorter and has fewer quests than Skyrim or Fallout 4.  I personally went in not expecting Obsidian to have that kind of budget but I enjoyed that the quests I was given felt meaningful for the most part and usually had some kind of choice involved."
TheMandalorianTV,Elder Din is on his mission.
orangecounty,I don’t think CA 48 is ready for someone like Porter.  Steel scared Little Saigon into voting for her by calling Harley a communist.  A more progressive candidate would have a tougher time.

politics,We will have to wait for all the votes to be counted before we can do an autopsy on the 2020 election.   With Georgia in particular currently every statewide office is held by a Republican so I do not see how anyone can win there without a winning over some Republican voters.
politics,"Probably to give the candidates time to organize, debate, and promote themselves.  Its also after all of the holidays."
politics,Democrats in Georgia need to be attract Republican voters.  Impeachment is a wedge issue that pushes Republican voters into line.  Impeachment also brings Nancy Pelosi into the spot light and she’s a bit of a boogie man on Fox News.
politics,We should let Biden’s Justice Department look into outgoing administration’s crimes.
politics,An impeachment is just a trial by the senate and like any trial there are many possible outcomes.   Trump was found not guilty but he could have been removed from office.   When Bill Clinton was impeached he lost his law license for allegedly lying while under oath.
tuesday,"To take advantage of competing schools the student needs to be able to be transported to schools further away.   [Minorities are less likely to own a car](https://nationalequityatlas.org/indicators/Car_access#/) which means they will have fewer options for schools compared to their white neighbors.

tuesday,As you probably know the newly acquired territory under Polk accelerated the divide between free and slave states more than anything.  I seriously doubt Congress removing filibusters factored into the hostilities.

tuesday,"I'm personally indifferent on the filibuster but the House removed their filibuster in 1842 and it didn't destroy the republic. 

As a side note if we're going to have a filibuster we should at least require the senator to actually stand and speak Mr. Smith style instead of just sending everyone home."

orangecounty,I’m very critical of Reagan but I don’t think he’s in the same league as Trump.  The Trump Administration has been criminally incompetent at nearly every endeavor.  Reagan at least had prior experience as a governor and appointed mostly competent people in his White House.
Games,AEW is friendly with AAA.  They could probably add a bunch of luchadors to pad the roster.
tuesday,I recall a lot of people on TV calling for giving Trump a chance and hope that he would rise to the occasion.  It didn't last long since his administration began with drama about his inauguration crowd and the immediate firing of his national security advisor.

centerleftpolitics,"How would you guys feel about the Democratic Party giving the green light on running more Blue Dog Democrats in the vane of Joe Manchin in socially conservative states?   I know Manchin gets a lot of shit from more progressive democrats but running candidates that are wishy washy on wedge issues is the only way I see democrats being competitive in more evangelical states.

I started thinking about this after hearing a story on NPR around a year ago about a member of the democratic party in a deeply red state that pushed for language to encourage ""pro life democrats"" after hearing from many voters that preferred the Democratic Party's platform but couldn't get over the abortion issue.  I would also like to clarify that I am not encouraging the Democratic Party to change their stances on the national level."

neoliberal,Justice Dems could probably find a woke kid that might be able to win a democratic primary in a red state or at the very least hurt the blue dog candidate going into the general election.
neoliberal,Take of unknown heat: If the Democrats want to be competitive in flyover senate races they need to encourage more candidates like Joe Manchin that are wishy washy on abortion.  The problem is that these candidates will get so much shit from coastal dems and if one of these guys actually succeeds people will throw money at a DemSoc candidate in their primary.

California_Politics,For some reason California has a long history of voting more conservative on ballot propositions.  We have consistently voted to keep executions on the books and even voted against gay marriage in 2008.
tuesday,The Secret Service is [sending reinforcements to Delaware](https://twitter.com/briantylercohen/status/1324600522226085888).   Seems like they are anticipating Joe being declared President Elect.
tuesday,Asians are not a monolith.   For example Vietnamese in Southern California are extremely active in the the Republican Party.
tuesday,Its a case by case basis.  For example Samoa has hereditary institutions that are incompatible with the American Constitution.   Citizens in territories are also exempt from most federal taxes so its not always an easy sell.
tuesday,I just want a Republican senate to negotiate and make compromises with the House instead of just blocking everything.   We need the two houses of congress to act in good faith again.

tuesday,Looks like the [USPS has a lot of undelivered ballots](https://twitter.com/johnkruzel/status/1324004554485211136)
orangecounty,California processes mail in ballots early while a lot of the swing states count mail in ballots later.  Its possible that the early lead was due to democrats being more represented in the mail in vote while more conservatives showed up to vote in person on election day.
orangecounty,I thought Harley had it in the bag when he had a 10 point lead with the early vote.  It went down to the wire in 2018 so hopefully he clutches it out.
politics,Democrats seem to have favored voting by mail.   Lots of states chose to count mail ballots after the election day ballots.  It will be interesting to see how much they shift once they open the mail ballots.

tuesday,I don't see SpaceX raising the capital to do Mars missions on their own.  They have innovated a lot and reduced the costs of space travel but a Mars mission will be incredibly expensive and have no tangible financial return.   At the very least they will need some kind of government subsidization.

tuesday,Best Star Wars in any form since KOTOR.
TheMandalorianTV,I've come to terms with it but the decision was very jarring since as a kid Boba Fett was THE Mandalorian.   The entire reasons Mandalorians exist was to explain what type of culture Boba Fett came from.
TheMandalorianTV,I hope there’s a way for the Fetts to be considered Mandalorians again but George was very adamant about them not actually being Mandalorian.
TheMandalorianTV,Cobb is just a random dude so he probably couldn’t tell the difference.   Mando wore mostly durasteel before he got his shiny new gear so I assume mandalorians  walking around with durasteel is not that unheard of.
TheMandalorianTV,"For whatever reason George Lucas was adamant that the Fetts were not actually Mandalorians.  Its why there's a line in the Clone Wars cartoon where a Mandalorian basically calls Jango just some guy wearing their armor.   

Its also worth pointing out that the Fett armor is durasteel and not Beskar."
TheMandalorianTV,The Fett armor was [attached to a cloth outfit](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71dASSES93L._AC_SX425_.jpg).   I'm guessing the cloth got dissolved by the sarlac. Cobb jut wears the durasteel loosely over his street clothes which makes it look weird.
TheMandalorianTV,So I have a question about Boba and Temura.  Temura is pushing 60 but if I did the math right Boba should be just under 40.  I know most clones age faster but wasn't Boba supposed to be a perfect clone that ages normally?
bipartisanship,Probably some socially distanced gaming.
neoliberal,"Hunter's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden) does a decent job explaining why Hunter was on the board of Burisma in the first place.  

TL;DR: He is a lawyer that specializes in corporate governance and Burisma hired an American law firm to bring their corporate practices in line line with western standards.  Since Burisma's priority was to get out of sanctions they decided they needed an expert on ethical business practices on their board of directors and Hunter volunteered.   

Being the VP's son probably got his foot in the door but he was doing legitimate work."

centerleftpolitics,"I really like Robert Garcia's chances.   He's relatively young and would be great for outreach in the Latino community which has not been as politically engaged as they could be.   I also believe if appointed he would be the first openly gay man in the senate and the first queer person of color in the senate.

He was also president of his university's Young Republicans club but switched parties not too long after leaving college.   This experience might come in handy when working across the aisle."
California_Politics,I'm really liking Robert Garcia's chances.   He's been doing a lot of outreach for the Biden campaign and had a prominent spot at the DNC.
Games,Fable was fun but nowhere close to what he promised.  It was my first experience with the Molyneux hype train so that game will always leave a bad taste in my mouth.
LosAngelesRams,Super Bowl Fitzmagic might be a force of nature.
tuesday,"I am in favor any compromise that prevents further escalation of the of gamesmanship of the courts whether that is turn limits, a justice volunteering to step down, or Joe Biden’s bipartisan committee that he’s been talking about.  

I honestly believe the courts can come back from the damage it went through over the last few years but I do not believe it can survive overt court packing.   Venezuela, Argentina, and Hungary took major turns for the worse after they went down that road."
tuesday,"I mean a member of the BoG resigned citing executive interference then the new Post Master General immediately created chaos within the USPS that played into the president’s messaging right before the election.  If nothing else they acted in a way that creates the appearance of purposefully creating chaos.  

No idea where you got the idea of the Deep DNC plotting to force out Biden.   That’s some crazy shit."
tuesday,Because only one of us is wrong.
tuesday,"Mitch got those judges by acting in bad faith while working within the established rules.  Court packing is a power grab that throws out all of the established rules.  I understand why it is tempting to go in that direction but if you look at nations that used that power they came out less liberal.  

I have no idea what Biden’s bipartisan committee to fix the legitimacy of the courts will cook up but the Democrats are about to win a trifecta.  You can use that to enshrine court decisions you value into laws.  Thomas and Alito are both in their 70s so Democrats have a shot at flipping those seats in the next ten years."
tuesday,"I only see Thomas doing it for partisan reasons like preventing a younger conservative from having to step down.   

Court packing will guarantee a liberal majority until the conservatives come to power and decide to pack the court themselves.   Mitch's shenanigans has harmed the legitimacy of the court but it can be undone in time.   I don't think anything can undo the the damage of parties overtly packing the court."
tuesday,And someone said that I was giving in to conspiracy theories when the Post Master General ordered the dismantling of mail sorters.
tuesday,Biden has a history of acting in good faith.   There is a reason he was the only person in the Obama White House that Mitch would agree to negotiate with.
tuesday,I think Clarence Thomas would offer to step down to keep Roberts as Chief Justice.  Thomas is in his 70s so if Roberts steps down then somethings happens to Clarence during a Biden or Harris administration the courts can swing 5-4 the other way.
tuesday,I'm so sorry.
tuesday,"They never had a definitive vote for statehood.  Previous referendum was boycotted so it was not representative.   The time before that it was broken up into two different questions with part 1 being a simple yes or no on whether PR should maintain the status quo.   Part 2 was something like ""If PR did change its status should it be an independent country or a state?"" with no option for ""None of the above"".   The incoming governor that that referendum was bullshit and asked Washington to not recognize it."
mealtimevideos,"Looks like Only Fans is more of a repackaging of the ""Girlfriend Experience"" that has been sold by and prostitutes for ages."
neoliberal,Biden was the only person in the Obama White House that McConnell  would negotiate with.  So there is reason to give Mitch an opportunity to act in good faith before changing the senate rules.
LosAngeles,I really hope the Dodgers don't become the baseball equivalent of the 90s Buffalo Bills.
vtmb,Who was the producer that was fired?
politics,The AntiFa dress code makes them look like the bad guys which makes them an easy target.
tuesday,It can be anything from bruising to Warfarin necrosis.   We probably won't get a good answer unless Mitch or his doctor talks.
tuesday,El Trafico > El Clasico
tuesday,Nuclear costs a lot up front but once everything is built it relatively cheap to operate.
vtmb,"There's a reason I said it looked like something was going wrong, not that there was definitely something wrong.   But carry on with your unwarranted self importance."

tuesday,There’s a better argument for Chicago pizza than there is for hotdogs being a sandwich.
SquaredCircle,I really wish there was a way for Hassan to challenge Rusev back when Rusev was beating up an American wrestler every week.
SquaredCircle,As bad as the turn towards terrorism was I still crack up when Hassan’s kayfabe defense was that since they were hooded there was no way to know if they were Arab.
SquaredCircle,I wish Sandow just returned to that after Mizdow ran its course.

the_darnold,We will follow GEQBUS to the XFL if we have to.
the_darnold,Joe Flacco clearly needed more time sitting behind GEQBUS so he could learn how to properly play the game.
tuesday,"Young people that I used to see wearing Che shirts started wearing that Hope shirt in 2008.   With that said Obama had more of a general ""cult of celebrity"" around him which was very different vibe than the kind of cult that exists  around Trump."
tuesday,Its a liberal area but the LA Q chapter has been very active lately.
neoliberal,Pete is marketing his new book so his team probably booked him for the largest sub that offered.

nfl,Sam and Bill can bond over being screwed by the Jets management.
nfl,The only way this makes sense to me is if they don’t think Dak is coming back next season or if they want to use Darnold as a bluff to get Dak to sign a more team friendly deal.
nfl,He had that cool rushing highlight.
nfl,Pretty sure the Cowboy’s second string is better than the Jets first string.
nyjets,I hope Sam sits out the rest of this season.   There’s no reason to let him get hurt when the team is in full tank mode.
orangecounty,I check 538 daily but have not been able to find a poll for this race.
SquaredCircle,Everyone's measurements are kayfabed unless they played a competitive sport that made their real measurements easy to find (like Brock).
vtmb,"They're not a Nazi haven but Nazis just so happen to like these games.   There was discussion about it awhile back on the Paradox forums when they banned some racist mods for Stellaris and banned some memes that were appropriated by white nationalists (Remove Kebab, Deus Vult, etc).  

I would like to make it clear that Paradox has never sought this demographic out or catered to them in any way but for some reason Nazis get attracted to their games.   Maybe because GSGs let them play out alternative histories."
Fallout,It was good for bringing in a lot of new fans.  I would have never played Fallout 1&2 if it was not for Fallout 3 and I believe there are a lot of other fans with a similar story.   I also find find first person games in general to be more immersive than isometric games but each perspective has their own strengths and weaknesses.
tuesday,They should have at least seen how the challengers did at Iowa before they closed everything down.
Fallout,Honestly Bethesda’s Fallout games always felt like East Coast spinoffs to me since all the games I care about are set on the west coast.
Fallout,I think first person perspective was a good direction for the series.  Isometric RPGs don’t port well to consoles and they’ve become more and more of a niche genre as time went on.
tuesday,I think we’re going to be stuck with a version of Q for at least a decade.  Religions die slowly.
tuesday,Younger voters are [overwhelmingly pro choice](https://news.gallup.com/poll/244709/pro-choice-pro-life-2018-demographic-tables.aspx).  If we want to be competitive in the future we need to reframe the abortion debate or just drop it.  While it will piss off the base in the short term I can see broader appeal for a pro life movement that concentrates on preventing abortions from being necessary in the first place.
tuesday,Vietnamese are a notable voting bloc in Southern California.  I think the biggest barrier for Asian Americans is voter turnout.  In my experience older Asians Americans do not want to get involved for one reason or another
tuesday,Go full centrist like Charlie Baker.
tuesday,That would be a good hire but I get the feeling Mattis is completely burnt out on politics.
tuesday,The GOP cancelled their primaries pretty early so there was no point in propping up a primary challenger.
politics,We’ll see what happens.  Katie Porter’s seat has traditionally been as red as they come.
politics,"Feinstein definitely behaved poorly after after she lost her cool.   My only point is that the short clip makes it appear that she walked up the kids and immediately started talking down to them.   In the longer clip there's context where an adult kept cutting her off which led to Dianne losing her cool.  

As a seasoned politician Feinstein should be better at controlling her temper but I find the removal of context misleading."
politics,We'll have to see what happens.   Some journalists believe we're currently in a political realignment where the GOP will be Trumpy going forward which will push suburban conservatives into the Democratic Party.   If this happens I have no idea what's going to happen to the Democrats going forward since it will be hard to keep the suburban conservatives and the Bernie-AOC wing happy.
vtmb,"There's a portion of fans that hate Cara since they believe Brian was fired to let a more ""woke"" writer take the lead."
vtmb,"She tweeted out that she left to work on different projects.   It could be something as simple as she already finished her work and wanted to leave the U.S because of the pandemic, or maybe  she didn't like the change in management.   I really doubt Paradox cares about the woke levels of their games since its known that neo nazis love their strategy games.     

Either way I'm pretty sure this whole debacle is connected to how many times the game has been delayed.   When producing smaller games they tend to be hands off until around the third delay/missed milestone.   A relatively recent example was the cancellation of East vs West."
Infographics,There does not seem to be a direct correlation between the most fit cities and [the cities with the highest income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_metropolitan_areas_by_per_capita_income).
politics,Robert Garcia has his eyes on that seat.  He’s one of Biden’s advisors and had a prominent spot at the Convention which might be a signal that the party is backing him for the seat.
politics,I’m by no means a Feinstein fan but I find the 2 minute video misleading.  Feinstein was initially nice to the kids but every time she tried to explain her position to them the blonde woman cut her off.  After this happened a few times Dianne got frustrated and lost her cool.
Games,The Enclave in NV are directly connected to FO2 while FO3 retconned the Enclave into having an East Coast chapter that was just as powerful.
SquaredCircle,Sometimes I wonder if Dave keeps tweeting about Cornette so Jim can have content for his podcast.  I like both these guys bur this feud is getting stale.
tuesday,It depends on how many democratic senators there are in January.   If its just 50 or 51 some red/purple state democrats will probably block it.   If they have 52 or more they can probably push it through.

neoliberal,It got downgraded due to stupid games but the end result is still higher interest rates which makes newer debt more expensive.   This compounded with the largest annual deficits in American history means we will be spending a larger and larger percentage of our annual budget on just paying the interest.   This is not sustainable.
neoliberal,"Jonathan V Last.  He writes for The Bulwark and did an AMA here a little
over a week ago."
neoliberal,"Is the democratic party’s big tent going to be sustainable going forward?   If JVL is correct about the GOP doubling down on Trumpism for the foreseeable future then suburban voters will be a major voting bloc for the Democrats and will try to pull the party more towards the center.   

I don’t see the progressive wing appreciating this new bloc especially since they plan to take over the party once the boomers get out of the way."
centerleftpolitics,If Hallusk wants to give Carver Lamar then I don’t feel like its my business to block it.
tuesday,"An angry Texan billionaire who had a grudge against HW Bush for brushing off his concern about the possibility of some POWs being left behind in Vietnam.  Perot attacked Bush from the right which let an obscure Arkansas governor take residence in the White House.    

I believe both parties agreed to increase the support needed to join the general election debates after Perot so we will probably never see a three man general election debate again."
