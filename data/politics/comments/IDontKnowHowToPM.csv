AskReddit,Sanderson has said that he wouldn’t do it. He knows he’s not the right kind of author for that story.
legaladvice,"I’m confused. How would you be walking away with the console without first having given the agreed upon $1500? You don’t expect that they would actually hand it to you after you’ve only given them $500, do you?"
CrappyDesign,"I often read at night, so the light is obviously on and then I never remember to turn it off during the day. But getting one with a light has been a dream for me since I had to go a few years either not reading at night or just reading on the kindle app on my phone, which isn’t ideal for many reasons.

But I definitely love the look of the eInk screens for reading. And as much as I loved old school books, nothing beats being able to cart around my full library in my back pocket."
nextfuckinglevel,Nope. https://screenrant.com/dark-knight-heath-ledger-joker-hospital-explosion-explained/

AskReddit,"Try playing coop with no second player. I couldn’t find anyone to play with so I had to do the last set of levels playing both controllers. At one point I was moving one character with my feet while shooting portals with my hands, then dropping the controller in my hands and snatching the one at my feet to do what that character needed to do. I somehow managed to pull it off, but I’m sad that I didn’t get to do some good couch coop on it."

AskReddit,"Yeah as soon as I can get logged in, I’m gonna dig through the benefits info and make some calls. Luckily I have my RGPs for now, but god forbid I lose or break one."
AskReddit,"Yeah, I’ve had a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of insurance while trying to get diagnosed and treated. Took me multiple doctors to get diagnosed, one of whom was a neuro-ophthalmologist that was a real dick during the first visit, tried telling me that the problem was just dry eyes. When he finally did some tests and diagnosed me, he referred me elsewhere for treatment. The doctor that he referred me to accepted my medical insurance in one location where she could give me the hybrid lenses, but my vision insurance in a different location where she couldn’t. 

I finally have a doctor that can fully take care of me, but they always mess up the billing. It’s a damn hassle. Oh and I just went to her website because it was on my mind. She doesn’t take VSP. So I’m gonna have to go on the hunt again."
AskReddit,"Well that’s comforting. My doctor actually tells me she’s surprised at how much my PMD affects my vision because it’s not that severe. But without my RGPs, I have a hard time seeing things clearly that are even five feet away from me, and even reading can be hard because of how the ghosting overlaps the real letters. With the RGPs, though, I’m 20/20 in the right eye and 20/15 in the left."
AskReddit,"I currently have EyeMed, but I recently changed jobs and will have VSP. I’m not sure what their benefits are exactly because their site is being a dick and I can’t get signed in.

I’m not sure if EyeMed covers the appointments for my contacts. I just know my optho always bills them for the appointment."
AskReddit,Close. Pellucid Marginal Degeneration. Which is basically keratoconus but different in some way that’s never been 100% clear to me.
AskReddit,"My vision insurance covers the medically necessary contact lenses for me 100%, but not the visit to the ophthalmologist to get them, which goes under my medical. Every year without fail there’s some screw up in figuring out who to bill for what."
oddlyspecific,Some cities will fine you for not mowing. It’s not just an HOA thing.
oddlyspecific,"My HOA is mostly useless, but that’s because of the residents not the board. The HOA has next to no budget and can’t get any projects done, but the residents keep voting down any increase to the dues. The one time they voted for a temporary increase was when I was the president and finally managed to convince them that our potholed road desperately needed to be redone."

AskReddit,"The way you phrased this reminded me of the time that Jesse Hasek from 10 Years basically teabagged the back of my hand. I was right up on the rail while they were playing, he came down and straddled the rail right where my hand was gripping. 

I’ve always wondered if I should have flipped my hand over."

I’m not a redhead, but during my colonoscopy, the doctor had to give me twice the normal dose of propofol because I tried to stand up and go do stuff.

AskReddit,"I’ve got vision issues that make subtitles difficult to read unless I’m wearing my hard contacts, and even then it’s a bit of an effort. So dubs are the way to go for me."
AskReddit,I unironically think they do make for excellent follow ups to the original and together with it make for an excellent trilogy. Provided that you look at the second and third as a single movie split into two parts rather than two separate movies.

Showerthoughts,"One of the “rules” of storytelling is that coincidences can cause more problems for your characters, but never solve them. Obviously this is not a 100% of the time rule because none are, but it makes sense. It’s not satisfying for the audience if everything’s wrapped up because of some twist of fate, but having that twist of fate give the characters another obstacle to overcome can make the story better or provide more room for character development."
dankmemes,"He was on opioids even during the filming of that season. I’m glad he turned his life around though, he seemed like a chill dude."
coolguides,"Yeah, but since it’s a new driver they’re more likely to be unpredictable, so you know to give them a bit more attention than you might otherwise."
coolguides,The new driver ones are useful in that you can be extra aware of them in case they do something unpredictable.
AskReddit,At least that would be quick.

justneckbeardthings,"Admittedly, most of my friends are nerds. But we’re all nerds about different things. Some are video game nerds, some are sci-fi tv show nerds, some are book nerds, some are music nerds, some are gardening nerds, some are rock climbing nerds, etc, and we all kind of overlap between a few of the different things. 

I guess my point is that everyone is a nerd about something. It’s just that only some of those things are typically what comes to mind when you think “nerd”."
oddlysatisfying,Since forever at least where I am. Last year they pushed them out nationwide for a limited time.
oddlysatisfying,"The worst for me was when I was working at BK and someone came through the drive thru and ordered 50 orders of tacos. Two tacos to an order means 100 tacos, which are one of the most annoying things to make at BK. You can only cook like 6 of them at a time because they go in the fryer in a special fryer basket, and you’ve only got the one special basket. They luckily only took a minute and 10 seconds to cook, but that’s still 17 rounds of cooking for a total of about 20 minutes to cook them up. And once each round is cooked, you have to pry the damn thing open while it’s still hot from the fryer to stick half a slice of cheese and some lettuce in there. Guaranteed to burn your fingers every time. Oh, and of course the manager was rushing us to both finish the order and also do the other customers’ orders at the same time.

brooklynninenine,Ghosted. I enjoyed it but it got canceled super quick. I think they made a couple episodes after they learned they were getting canceled and you can tell they’re just having a ton of fun with it since it’s not a matter of making it to another season.
todayilearned,Oh man you mentioning the video game is unlocking some memories that were apparently locked in the back corner of my brain.
todayilearned,"They definitely know how to get a crowd going. Probably the second best show I’ve seen next to Trans-Siberian Orchestra, which is just a whole other level."

MovieDetails,"Because it did.

Take the entire final showdown. Rather than being a deconstruction of the “final battle with the villain” cliche, it was just a straightforward fight. Kid’s in danger and Slater saves him. There was no satire there, you could take that exact scene and stick it into any other action movie from that time and it wouldn’t be out of place.

Then there’s the fact that Slater’s daughter just disappears from the film after she picks them up at the tar pits. That disappearance could actually be a great bit of satire, except that they never acknowledge the fact that she’s nowhere to be found. Have Danny say “Hey where did Whitney go?” and Slater just shrug as if it’s a normal thing. But instead, it’s just the writers forgetting about her.

The whole thing was just a slow moving confused mess. They dragged on some of the jokes far too long, and then completely missed opportunities to make others. And it was certainly not helped by the fact that the guy who wrote most of the movies the original script was satirizing was brought in to do the rewrites."
MovieDetails,The satire didn’t go over my head. It just wasn’t well done in my opinion.
MovieDetails,"I mean, [I’m not the only one who felt that way about it. ](https://www.popmatters.com/185880-last-action-hero-2495614117.html)"
MovieDetails,"Just rewatched that recently. It does not hold up very well. 

It just seems confused about what it’s trying to be. Is it a satire? Well, kinda but it plays a lot of the tropes too straight to be fully satire. Is it a serious action movie? Again, not exactly because it does poke fun at a lot of what action movies from that era we’re doing. It’s like two different sets of people were writing the script and one set thought they were supposed to make fun of action movies and the other thought they were supposed to be making yet another action movie. 

Charles Dance was fantastic as the bad guy though. Can’t fault that performance."
MovieDetails,"Nah, it wasn’t a bet or a joke. It was John Woo doing what John Woo does best."
MovieDetails,Not just Travolta and Cage. Travolta as Cage and Cage as Travolta. It’s gloriously ridiculous.
apple,"To give a non-politeness answer, it can be a smart idea to let scam calls ring through. If you send them to voicemail, their system knows that someone at least pays attention to calls so they’ll keep calling in the hopes that one time, you’ll answer. If you let it ring through, they’re more likely to not waste their time on you."
AskReddit,"My buddy had the dollar dance at his wedding, but it wasn’t just the bride, women would put a dollar in his jacket pocket to dance with him too. Naturally, since we were like 19 at the time, I put a dollar in his pocket and danced with him for the laughs that two dudes dancing would elicit."
dataisbeautiful,"For me it depends on whether I feel like heading to the end of the block to pick it up and again to drop it off to save a couple bucks. If I’m feeling lazy, I’ll rent it on Amazon or wherever; if I’m feeling cheap, I’ll go to redbox."
gatekeeping,This is very true. But there has to be something said for being able to just eat a plate of boneless wings with a fork and not need to spend five minutes cleaning your hands afterward. That’s a life saver if you’re getting wings for lunch and have to rush back to work when you’re done.

AskReddit,"The last time I went grocery shopping, every aisle I went down, there was this one guy coming down the opposite direction. Every damn time.

NoStupidQuestions,"The fourth book (I have such trouble remembering the titles for some reason) was a bit of a let down too, but it was more forgivable at the time. He had planned on the series ending with book four, but realized he had more ground to cover before the finale. So it understandably felt like filler for a lot of the book. 

Then again, Kip and Tisis had a fantastic arc in that book. Too bad she kinda disappeared in the last one..."
NoStupidQuestions,I hated the last book so much though.
ProgrammerHumor,"I’m currently learning. On one of my assignments, I was stuck for two days because some, but not all, of my checks were off by one. It took me two days to realize that in one of my loops, I needed an else statement to reset my counter variable. Two days for two lines of code, 14 total keystrokes including spaces. 

The moment I figured it out was both immensely frustrating and insanely satisfying. Very odd feeling."
AskReddit,"If you are actively trying to have kids but are having fertility problems or recently experienced a loss, or even worse, had a child that then passed away, getting that question can reopen some very raw wounds."
AskReddit,"The gut serotonin thing is why in more severe cases of IBS, they treat it with low doses of antidepressants. 

Related, I apparently get crazy vivid dreams when on low doses of antidepressants."
AskReddit,"Yeah, they did that to the dude that replaced Rube."
AskReddit,I’m sorry to have been the one to remind you.
AskReddit,"They recast Daisy and replaced Rube with some rando. Plus they also broke just about every rule the series had set up for the universe. For example, in the series if a reaper tries to talk to their family about their old life, they lose their memories, but in the movie, George spends half the thing hanging out with Reggie going all “Yeah I’m your dead sister but I’m a reaper now.”"
AskReddit,The romance wouldn’t have been so bad if they had spent some time building it up. But instead we got four and a half seasons of them basically being siblings and then maybe two episodes of “Oh we love each other now.”

explainlikeimfive,"I mean yeah, Tabasco is the mildest of mild hot sauces, but it’s definitely not ketchup. It’s got peppers, vinegar, and salt. There’s no tomatoes in it, which is what makes ketchup."
AskReddit,"I’ve only really had one experience with that business, and it was honestly the easiest part of the whole process of losing my daughter. 

The funeral home donated their services. The only thing we had to pay for was the urn itself, which they don’t sell themselves they just order it for you. I’m sure they get a cut of it, but considering it was a $200 urn, that’s nothing compared to the few thousand they normally charge for cremation and such. So I’ll let them have that."
hotsaucerecipes,"So this was one that I just kind of threw together. I used dried habaneros since that’s what I had on hand. It turned out really good though, but I might change/add a couple things next time I make it. Such as maybe replacing some of the vinegar with lime juice to get some citrus going in there, and maybe actually measure the cumin and black pepper instead of “meh that looks like enough” amounts. 

6 large-ish jalapeños 

9 dried habaneros

Half a small onion

2 cloves garlic

1 tsp salt

1/2 cup white vinegar

Cumin

Black pepper

Remove stems from habaneros and rehydrate in hot water for 15 - 20 minutes. Remove stems from jalapeños. Throw everything in a blender or food processor and blend for a good long while until it’s nice and smooth. 

Strain into a pot through a wire mesh strainer, really working the mixture until you’ve pushed as much of it as you can through. Bring to a boil and then lower the heat to a simmer for 10 - 15 minutes. Let it cool and pour into sterilized bottles."

gaming,"I used to lug around a full Rock Band set up. Drums in a duffle along with my skinny PS2, the game itself, and the cords. One guitar on each shoulder, straps crisscrossing my chest with the guitars neck down on my back. I’d hoof it to a friend’s and then set it all up. It got much heavier when I finally upgraded to the Guitar Hero full band set up on the 360 and had to lug that beast around instead of the PS2. Plus the drums were much bigger even broken down."

And I agree that they're an invading force to a certain degree, but the Yeerk Peace Movement or whatever it was called does add a bit of a grey area there.

Like I would be fine with killing the yeerks in a pool being a moral issue in the series if there was more consistency about the Animorphs caring about the hosts that end up as casualties of the war. But it's so sporadic that it makes it an uneven concern between the two."
Animorphs,"I mean, Cassie definitely struggled with the death of the hosts a few times. And I’m pretty sure at least one of the others did as well. 

And Jake did boil the hot tub of yeerks in the hospital pretty early on. 

Doesn’t take away from your overall point, though. They are definitely cavalier about killing hosts most of the time, under the justification that death is better than the hellish slavery of being infested. But that justification does not quite jive with the repeated instances of “we can’t kill the defenseless yeerks who aren’t in hosts yet.”"

unpopularopinion,"I’ve gone more than my fair share of times since they’re the closest place that does wings other than shit like Chili’s or Applebee’s, which really don’t count. But there’s more to making good wings than just dumping them in a fryer with a set timer. Every wing is different and will require a slightly different amount of time to be cooked to perfection. Places like BWW just set the timer to be long enough that no wings _should_ be undercooked, but none should be a smoldering crisp, either.

It's probably different for each city, but for [Portland, for example](http://www.ci.portland.me.us/152/Marriage-Licenses), it's $40 for the license fee, and $125 to get married right there at the clerk's counter, no appointment. Can't get any faster than that."

legaladvice,[I think you've got bigger things to worry about right now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c5m9fo/need_some_serious_help/)
legaladvice,"So I kind of want to make sure I have this timeline correct. Your son was born 6 weeks early, so that's at 34 weeks gestation, right? And then was released from the NICU one week later? Or was it one week after your fiancee was discharged? If it's the latter, how long was she in the hospital?

Basically, what I want to know is how long was your son in the NICU?

In any case, yes, leaving for even a week while your son is in the NICU is a major, **major**, no-no. If you absolutely had to take care of that move in that specific week, you could have handled it solo while your fiancee stayed with your son. Or even better, you both could have stayed while you had friends/family take care of moving your things. Or just postponing the move because you had something infinitely more important going on and everything else should have waited.

>we took advantage of him being in the nicu

That is an absolutely troubling way of phrasing this. The NICU is not some convenient daycare service. Even if he was doing well the whole time, those first few weeks are absolutely crucial for bonding with your child, especially for the mother. And to be quite honest, I don't know how either of you could bear not going to see him for more than a day.

>They're making us out to be these horriable people who abandoned our son

That's honestly what it looks like. Most people who have babies in the NICU are there every damn day, for several hours at a time. It is completely unusual for new parents to take an extended period of time away from their child while said child is in INTENSIVE CARE. It's not surprising in the slightest that CPS got involved.

Now on to the legal advice.

The good news for you is that CPS doesn't like to take children from their parents except as a last resort. I can't say how likely or unlikely it is for you specifically to end up having your son taken into state custody because I don't know your history or the specifics of your case. But as long as you keep doing what CPS and the courts ask you to do, you will make sure you have the highest possible chance of keeping your son.

If you want to be extra, extra sure, you can get a consultation with an attorney. I know you can't afford one to represent you, but a lot of attorneys will let you come in to get some quick advice. It'll be less expensive than having them fully represent you. If the attorney thinks that you need full representation, then I'd suggest selling anything you can, begging your friends, etc., whatever you need to do to afford their fee. Ask if they can set up a payment plan, etc.

As a last bit of non-legal advice, be grateful that your son graduated from the NICU. Not all children do. Imagine what you would have done if he hadn't made it and you were in a different city because moving was apparently more important to you at the time. If you keep your son, hug him every damn day and never forget that he's the most important thing in your life ever again."

legaladvice,"You said the HOA maintains the exteriors of all the homes, right? I know that yours didn't really get damaged, but if others did, the members of the HOA would all be equally responsible for paying for those repairs."
legaladvice,"$130/month is not really that high of an HOA fee. And the dues go to more than just insurance. I don't know what your community is like, but if you've got yards that are maintained by the HOA, the dues go toward paying the landscaping company that does that. If you've got a community pool, the dues pay for that maintenance. If you're on a private road, the dues pay for that. Tree trimming, snow plowing, etc."
legaladvice,"Well, I didn't want to get into this initially, but there are a number of reasons why the HOA board doesn't want to use funds from their reserve to pay for these specific repairs. Most commonly, it's because there's some sort of larger maintenance project planned and if they used that money to pay for the hail repairs, they'd have to put off that project, which means the community property might fall into some disrepair and it'd be that much more difficult to get things back where they want them.

If you have questions about what projects your HOA has planned or why the funds they already have aren't being used for the hail damage, you are always free to go to your next HOA meeting to ask. If you think they're not allocating funds properly, you can run for a position on the HOA board."
legaladvice,"My reading is that the hail did $200k in damage, which is below the HOA's deductible so they won't be getting anything from insurance to pay for repairs."
legaladvice,"Judging from that letter, it looks like enough of the community was damaged that the HOA does not have enough funds in reserve to cover repairs. One thing that HOAs can do is a ""special assessment"", which is basically having everyone pay more on top of the monthly dues for a specific project, in this case, repairs.

Your options here are pretty much just to pay the assessment. If you don't have $12k lying around, you can contact the HOA board to see if they will allow you to make some sort of payment arrangement. It looks like they have someone's contact information right there in the letter, so I'd recommend doing that. You'll probably also want to beef up your own homeowner's policy so that this sort of thing can be submitted as a claim on your insurance in the future."
