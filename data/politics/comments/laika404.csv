conspiracy,"Id like to break down and respond to a few points in your comment if that's alright (This is not meant to be read in a super aggressive way, just more as taking it piece by piece):

> will be used to usher in things

Do you believe that there is no way to fix the hate/discrimination without ushering in any ""draconian and illiberal"" things?

In my view, we should be working to fix the problems rather than giving up at the start and accepting the hate/discrimination as a necessary part of society.

> The handful

1. The hate/discrimination is faced by most LGBT people.  That's the reason to push for fixes.
2. The impact is still massive.  Think of how many people died because the US government didn't want to address the AIDS epidemic and thought it was only affecting gay men.  Think of how many people are still dying today because of it.
3. The people that have been lost and the potential wasted is worth the push in my opinion.  Think of what discoveries we would have had if they didn't chemically castrate Alan Turing.  Think of the leaders we could have had if they weren't marginalized due to their orientation (many great leaders in history are thought to be closeted).  Think of the great lives cut short due to suicide or murder.  

> the default which is the nuclear family

That's not the ""default"".  Never has been.  It's common in recent western history, no doubt, but to say it's the ""default"" for humans is wrong.  Raising children communally is not strange.  Having large numbers of children is not strange.  Research is showing that having half siblings is much more common than we thought  (I've read estimates >10%).  Polygamy, polyamory, bisexuality, and homosexuality of all forms are very common throughout history and all cultures.  Things like Eunuchs were historically very common too.

> Increasing [...] Masculinization of Females

Can you give me an example of this?  A lot of opinions, about what gender roles are, are Victorian era creations, which given the length of human history makes them strange.

> Speech codes

I am not so sure I see a purposeful link between trying to socially attack certain behavior and pushing for oppressive government regulations.  Most of what I see is publicly attacking people for speech so society knows it's wrong, not trying to imprison people for speech.  I think there is a distinct difference in most people's minds between attacking someone for bad behavior and outlawing bad behavior.  

I openly support people's right to use slurs, but I also tell my friends to not shop at places or support organizations that use those slurs, and I will tell people that they are shitty for using those slurs."

vermont,"This is actually more of a Colorado/Utah joke, than a VT one.  

Texans would flock to Colorado to go skiing in the winter.  They never knew what they were doing, were unprepared for the snow (hence the jeans), and were a mess that basically everyone hated.  So someone who skis in jeans just became a trope that skiers out there could all identify and collectively dislike.  

I think the joke is lost out here because our neighboring source of tourists generally understand winter and how to dress for the snow."
WhitePeopleTwitter,"> Supply and demand.

Elasticity

> then the wage for a barista goes up until one is willing to take the job

It doesn't though because the world is MUCH more complex than just saying supply and demand will solve it.  It takes generations to reach the steady state where prices will match needs.  And in the meantime that leads to the quality of life going down for most people.  And when you add in the complexity of national debt, regressive tax codes, and the externalities of road construction and maintanence, you wind up with a system that is headed for total failure in a couple generations.

> That still doesn’t mean the barista should expect to be the doctors neighbor 

In no way did I suggest a barista should be paid the same as a doctor.  Being neighbors doesn't mean having a house of the same price.  It means having town houses down the street, it means having affordable apartments one block over.  

-----

You talking about what is fair is ignoring the fact that the current system is less fair than the communist strawman you are arguing against.  And because of rising costs of living, it's getting worse.  

I laid out several problems with the system you are supporting, and it seems that you ignored all of them."
WhitePeopleTwitter,"> A barista not being able to afford the house next door to the doctor isn’t a problem with society

Actually, yes it is.  Where does the barista live?  If not in denver, then either the doctor can't get coffee, or the barista has to drive super far to go to work.  

If the doctor buys an espresso machine, then that's money going to China instead of the local economy. 

If the barista drives super far to work, then that means more roads are needed to support the commuters (which uses more tax dollars that could be spent elsewhere), which creates more pollution, which uses more land for parking (which is less land for housing), which means businesses rent is higher (passing costs onto customers), etc. etc. etc.

Also think of things like workers living in areas far away have less funding for schools per-student, meaning their children are less educated which hurts the whole country in the future.  (fewer educated workers, less innovation, more jobs overseas)

The list of second order effects of pushing out the workers is long.  And the TL;DR of it is that it hurts us all eventually."
vermont,"""Best"" is super subjective, and it's hard to award that title to a single state given all the different factors that make a state.  For me, there are some things that make Vermont a wonderful place, and some things that I miss from other places I have lived.

Most of the media is owned by the right.  Sinclair?  Fox?  Facebook?  The countless right wing news sites.  

---------

Republicans do control the schools and their curriculums.  States like texas and kansas indirectly control textbooks for the rest of the country.  NCLB was a bush policy.

Red states do receive all the handouts.  look at how much each state contributes to the federal budget vs how much they get from the feds.  Red states take the most, blue states produce the most.  

-----------

When obama was president, republicans and fox news publicly announced their one goal was to make obama a one term president.  They turned down free money for their states because it would make Obama's policies less successful.  They blocked THOUSANDS of court appointments, and when obama left, they packed them full of highly unqualified people (like a lifetime appointment with no prior experience and a recommendation against hiring them from the non partisan boards)

worldnews,"Conspiracy theorists being mostly right wing is a recent change (2015ish).  During the bush years most conspiracy theorists were far left anti-war types.  Really, Conspiracy theorists are at their core, just people who distrust those with power, and what power is most concerning depends on external factors (like wars, major stories, cultural trends, etc.).  Unfortunately republican strategists realized that this could be exploited.  

During Obama's second term there was a big push to amplify the the fears of people in a way that would help republicans.  For example: Instead of fearing billionaires manipulating society for personal gain, they amplified fears of communists manipulating society for power.  Instead of fearing an oppressive police state, they amplified fears of a lawless society.  Instead of fearing the military industrial complex, they amplified fears of what would happen if they lost a war.  The conspiracies fall directly out of those fears.

When election season rolled around, the seeds were sown and they just had to again cherry pick what stories to push and the community further polarized.  Suppress stories about Trump working with Russia, amplify stories about democrats inventing the story.  Suppress stories about republican astroturfing online, amplify stories about democratic astroturfing online.  Suppress stories about Trump, amplify stories about Clinton.  

People who saw through it were outnumbered and basically turned into an outgroup.  With the polarization across the country, it further consolidated into right wing and everyone else.  And because that is the core uniting trait of the community, it becomes embedded in every discussion.  Sprinkle in a little selection bias and you have a self-reinforcing system where anything not right-wing is a conspiracy."

vermont,"I apologize, I am presenting it more as a binary to try and answer the original question of ""why should they be taxed more [than full time residents]?""

The specifics of how much more, and how they are taxed, is a lot of politics and a whole other conversation."
vermont,"No question they do have a benefit, but it's a balance.  

Some vacationers are great for the state.  Like you said, they go out to eat at fancy places, go on tours, buy art and tourism gifts.  Property maintenance and management when they are out of state are good local jobs.  Their land is usually in growth which is helpful for local wildlife.  

But a lot of the benefits can be equally said for residents, and are sometimes better from residents.  Vacationers go out to eat during holidays.  Locals go out to eat in the off seasons.  Locals hire contractors too, and continue to buy local goods when the snowbirds are out of town.

Too many vacation home owners is a negative though.  Having a lot of driveways to plow doesn't help if you can't plow enough to pay the mortgage.  A restaurant may make a ton from the Christmas rush, but the servers need work in April too.  Someone wanting to get into farming will have trouble getting good land when it's all being subdivided and sold to vacation homes with restrictive HOAs.  

The way I see it is that people clearly already want to be in Vermont for vacation homes so we don't need to encourage them.  Property prices are climbing, so we know they are willing to pay the price.  And frankly, if Florida was perfect, they wouldn't be snowbirds, they would just be Floridians.  So don't think of taxes as discouragement, it's really to help local services and level the playing field for locals.  

Personally, I always like seeing taxes on empty houses.  That way they either live here and pay taxes as residents or rent it out and keep people generating income for the state.  The state gets supported either way, and it discourages speculation."
vermont,"Many of the resources they use cost money year round.  Roads are sized to handle the snowbirds, but still need maintenance when they are out of state.  Social services don't stop being needed just because someone is in florida.

Second homes require land and resources.  Both of which are not-infinite.  People with money buying up vacation homes increases the cost for everyone else.  This means that local workers have to commute longer to work and spend more for less.  More people commuting means more road maintenance, more pollution, more parking needs, etc.  People spending more on a mortgage means less money going into the local economy.

You have to think about the opportunity cost of a snowbird.  If they weren't in that house, who would be?  Would that person be better or worse for Vermont?  If it would be better to have someone else, then they should be taxed more."

I hate this attitude, every state has it.  

Making Vermont an exact clone of either Hollywood or backwoods Alabama aren't the only options...  We can adopt the successes other states where they fit along side with what makes Vermont a great place to live.

* Do Vermonters love driving long distances in their car and walking across acres of pavement to shop at a walmart or bedbathandbeyond to get something local stores don't have?  Several states are trying new redevelopment patterns that preserve historic town cores and attract great new locally run businesses.  
* Do commuters around the capitol hate the idea of functional and affordable rail service to and from Montpelier?  Denver and Portland OR have great lightrail systems, and I've seen a BRT that made commuting without a car actually reasonable.  
* Do cyclists love riding in the road with traffic?  Other cities and towns are finding ways to safely integrate bike infrastructure into their area so people don't have to drive everywhere if they don't want, and can safely enjoy some time out riding around.
* Traffic in Brattleboro can be a nightmare.  Should we ignore ideas from other cities simply because they aren't in Vermont?
* Most people cannot live in large parts of the state due to poor internet infrastructure.  Should we not see if another state did something to fix that?
* There are very few good jobs in this state for tech workers.  How did other states get so many?
* Vermont has wonderful outdoor activities year round.  Colorado and Oregon do too.  Those states are attracting young people and new businesses for that reason, but Vermont isn't.  Clearly we should take a look at what else they're doing right and see what makes sense for Vermont.

politics,"It's beneficial when taken with a few other key features.

* Originally, the EC delegates were chosen and sent to figure out who should be president.  This meant that uninformed people (in the time before phones, tv, and internet) weren't choosing the president, and delegates could properly inform themselves on issues and fitness of the candidate as it related to their community.  
    * Today, delegates are bound to the results of the popular vote in each state, so uninformed people are choosing the president
* Originally, the delegates were expected to pick more of a compromise candidate when they couldn't agree.  
    * Today, with only two major parties and delegates being bound to the state's popular vote in November, compromise candidates don't get chosen (spoiler effect).
* Originally, the founders worried that having a popular vote would give a president too much implicit power by way of a popular mandate.  The fear was that it would undermine the power of the other branches of the federal government and devolve into a pseudo monarchy.  Electing delegates to choose a president doesn't give the president that popular mandate.  
    * Today, because delegates are bound to the popular vote of each state, the president has a popular mandate anyway.
* Originally, the president's powers and federal powers were intended to be much more limited than they are today.  So having the president reflect the weighting of the house+senate didn't really take away power from any state.  
    * Today, the president has much stronger influence over states than in the past, so the unequal weighting works against more populous states.
* Originally representatives to the house (and thus the number of delegates a state has for president) was set at a small fixed number.  1 rep per 30,000 people.  This meant that the number of reps/delegates populous states had was much more fair with respect to their population.  
    * Today, because the house has been capped at 435, it's closer to 1 rep per 750,000 people.  This means that small states have a much larger say in the presidency than was originally intended.


One thing to note:  What I wrote as today's issues are not problems for many voters.  They don't care about informed voters, they like their party options, don't worry about presidential power, and like having small states with more weight in the presidential election"

David Stannard's (800k-1.5M) lowest adjusted estimates are 100k higher than the next highest extimate (Swanson's backcasting based estimate).  Swanson has a lot of experience in this field from what I can tell, and the methods he uses (backcasting) produce good values in typical situations.  But as Swanson notes in his paper (can find through google), these high estimates are not supported by archaeological evidence and are around 2x higher than estimates from people alive at that time.  This is because it is thought that the population of the islands plateaued prior to 1778, thus making backcasting a gross over estimate (depending on how long ago the population plateaued).

Reading the papers, Thomas Dye's estimate from 1994 (listed on page 9) seems to be the most likely and best supported by available data.  110,000-150,000."

ArchitecturalRevival,"There are many reasons why a building gets torn down or replaced.  Blaming ""demented modernists"" for thinking about new city architectures does not account for why things were torn down, and does nothing but sound silly.

Historic buildings in the 70s regularly had their ornamentation removed and their faces covered with stucco and sheet metal because they were too expensive to maintain in their original state.  East coast row houses were covered in cheap and ugly form stone because repointing and replacing failing brick was too expensive for most homeowners.  Old brick buildings were torn down and replaced with boring boxes because they were too costly to heat and repair.  Denver colorado was essentially demolished down because they had no tenants and the brick repairs with the heating costs were too much for the building owners to sustain.  

A building that cannot be maintained is a poorly built building.

politics,"> what is the Iowa Caucus?

Iowa is a state.  A caucus is an older and more communal way of voting.  A caucus is specifically done to choose what candidate a political party will nominate for the general election.  As a result, it's a lot less formal than the actual vote that takes place in November.

In a caucus, local party members (people registered as part of that party in a given precinct) get together and form groups by the candidate they prefer.  Each precinct gets a specific number of delegates to allocate between candidates.  If your candidate's group is small enough (less than 15% of the total), then your candidate gets no delegates and you are allowed to move to your second choice.  At this point all the other groups try to convince you where you should go.  Once those people are allocated, delegates are divvied up to the viable candidates based on the size of their group.

It's an old way to do it, and while it does have advantages, it can easily become a disorganized mess.

> Will this happen for all states?

No, a lot of states have primaries instead of caucuses.  Some of them have primaries specifically to avoid the problems Iowa ran into last night.

Colorado for example had such a mess with their caucuses in 2016 that they voted to get rid of them and force political parties to hold primaries (vote on a ballot).

> Why is this one so important?

Because they are the first state to hold a caucus/primary.  After the first few states, candidate who won't win drop out so that their second choice can take their voters in the subsequent states to vote.

> Who votes in this?

People from Iowa who are registered to to vote."

HumansBeingBros,"Thankyou.  You saved a life.  

I've been in a position where I needed someone like you before, and it's scary in a way that is hard to describe.

**Story:**  So I was at a burrito place on my lunch break when I choked on a bite.  After a few seconds failing to swallow it, I realized I couldn't get it loose, so I turned to my friend (who joined me for lunch) and gave him [the international choking sign](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c5b41f8c151e5ea63bcdc6ef8eb867b/tumblr_nwbyz8MbYq1qj1jrgo1_500.jpg).  *He didn't know what it meant.*  I made a gurgling noise and stood up panicking at this point trying to motion to him that I could not breathe.  He finally got the picture, and I turned around hoping he would give me the heimlich.  *He didn't know how to do it.*  He just kinda massaged my stomach, but didn't understand what needed to be done.

By this point it had been maybe 30-40 seconds since I last took a breath, and adrenaline was kicking in hard.  And more importantly, I was running out of air knowing I would pass out very soon.  So I pushed him aside and looked around the restaurant hoping at least one of the maybe 30 people in the building could help.  *But no one knew what to do.*  Not. a. single. fucking. person. in. the. building.  --  An image that will stick with me until I die is that one of the women who was standing in line for a burrito looked me in the eyes, saw me panicking, and clutched her purse.  Didn't help me, nope, she clutched her purse...

In the event that you find yourself in such a position, you need to jamb something into your gut hard enough to basically give yourself the heimlich.  Unfortunately, the way the chairs in the room were shaped I couldn't get them into my gut enough to make myself vomit and there were no other objects nearby that looked like they might be able to work.  I figured my only option was to see if there was something behind one of the doors that I could use, so I staggered into the bathroom.  I don't remember what happened next, but I used either the sink or toilet seat, and managed to make myself vomit up what was blocking my throat.

I firmly believe that had another 5 seconds passed before I made myself throw up, I would be dead.  No one in that building knew how to help me.  And something like 30 people nearly saw someone die on their lunch break.   

**Please learn the heimlich, you might need to save a life one day.**"

Nationwide it costs on average ~$30k/year to jail someone, so $250k is enough to jail ~8 people for 1 year.

You however seem to be defining ""fragile masculinity"" to include that this person views masculinity as something with a set of negative traits.  And thus are overcompensating for the need to embody those negative traits.

My issue is that the additions of ""they think bad behavior is masculine"" is a complete assumption.  You are taking a bad behavior and assuming it is a part of what they view as masculinity.  

The inherent implication therein is that *you* view those things as part of masculinity and not just as generic bad qualities.

Just about all protections for your property are restrictions on other's.  And this whole ""permission"" thing is a restriction on other's property rights...  Pollution isn't just a factory belching smoke, it includes things like light, noise, erosion, etc.

For example, Should someone else be allowed to dig a pond on their land even though it will become a breeding ground for mosquitos, or change the water table?  Should they be allowed to clear-cut their forest even though it will cause erosion damaging your property, or change the amount of water draining onto your land?  Should a land owner be allowed to build a 10 story apartment building 1 foot from the lot line of your land changing your view, reducing privacy, and blocking sunlight?  Can a neighbor throw a noisy party at 1AM next to your house?  

If your answer to the above is ""property rights can be protected through the court"" The you run the problem of lawsuits basically letting the wealthy to bleed people dry through the courts (both time and money wise).  This is a problem today, and if you lean on it harder (by reducing government groups that deal with this stuff pre-court) the problem will only get worse.

> Your support of regulation could be replaced simply by the enforcement of property rights.

But so much of property ""rights"" is a restriction on another property... Clear cutting a forest affects nearby land.  Putting up a fence affects animal movement.  digging a high volume well changes the water table.  

And what about things like monopolies?  That's not a property right.  We had monopolies and anti-competitive practices back in the good-ole days of lax regulation...  How do property rights deal with a company's ability to fire someone for reporting sexual harassment or because of their race?

Then no new roads would ever be built.  No new power lines would ever be built.  No new power plants would be built (because no new power transmission lines).  Cities can't be planned to a specific density because we can't build transit (Can't have a city if you can't get people to it).

I strongly disagree.  Is google powerful because the government gives them power?  Isn't the whole right-wing mantra that google stifles free speech because they are so large that them banning certain content is effectively modern day censorship?  The whole deplatforming cry is a micro-example of how corporate power is not attached to government power.

What if all ISPs decided to not allow you to access the internet?  What if all media platforms banned your IP?  What if all bookstores banned you?  You would not be able to participate in modern life...

No, they are descended from the natural cost and space requirements of installing connection to each home.

Markets have a carrying capacity, and you can't just waive that away as if it's not a factor...  And again, in this small-government hypothetical, you can't regulate the companies if something bad happens.  

> you pay by having leadership that is not a CEO who normally has a track record of performance

1. There is no requirement for performance for CEOs.  Not all companies are publicly traded.  Not all companies choose their head based on competence.  
2. You can choose a leader based on past performance.  In fact, that is one of the top things that people look for in a political leader.  It's why a large portion of the country did not vote for the current president...

This is a bigger issue than you are giving it credit for.  Franchise agreements have reasons for existing that are not all corrupt.  Yes they cause problems, but they also prevent others.  

Also, franchise agreements are not the only cause of crappy internet service.  Ive lived in several cities that have more than one provider, it just so happens that only one provider had good service and the others didn't want to invest in infrastructure...  0-government involved in that equation.

discussing extremes is useless.  I don't support full communism, I support heavy regulation of business to keep power with the people, and I believe that we need to give the government the power to regulate business effectively.  That is not extreme in any sense.

> One, is the limitations of power as shown above

How are property rights kept when a corporation pollutes your water supply?  Remember the corporation owns the government.  (Look at what's happening today with the current administration's EPA and various lawsuits being dropped)

How are property rights maintained when a corporation buys all the property around you making your land unlivable?  Remember that corporations own the government.  Think zoning will save your land when they pass a law removing all restrictions or re-zoning all property surrounding you?

What happens to your property rights when a corporation pays off the government to take your land through eminent domain?  Remember when capitalism runs amok corporations basically choose who your reps are.

> except for the direct protection of individuals

I guess my point is that without strong government you can't guarantee that.  You are giving people the power to control those who control your protection.  it's another layer of abstraction that inherently reduces your impact.  

> A business is much more fragile, compared to a government.  Ask General Motors, General Electric, or Sears.

Governments fall all the time.  Elections in the US can (and often are) essentially a policy coup.  Businesses can also last a long time.  Many of the old monopolies are still around under new names.

Not all of them.  What do defense contractors provide to society?  They start the wars that they supply...  When you wind up with monopolies providing services required by modern life (like ISPs) they have no competition.  So the service they provide is no different than a government.  BUT a government is not driven by profit, so they can offer these required services without the overhead of a CEOs pay.  sure there are many problems with budget overrun in government projects, but voters in theory have control of that by being able to elect the people running the project, where you have no such control over an ISP..."
conspiracy,"> Law abiding citizens don't have access to the black market as much as criminals do.

While this sounds good, it is a useless statement that doesn't either support or refute your position.  This is because it doesn't talk about how many people have access to the black market before or after a specific law is passed.  However, what is embedded in that statement is the implicit statement that the number of criminals before and after a new law is limited to only those who have access to the black market.  

So if you think that the law will not change things for the better, then you need to show that the law does not reduce access to the black market.

The rest of your argument is setting weights of bad people with guns vs good people with guns.  But because you have not established any weights before a specific law and after a specific law, you have nothing to base a conclusion off of.

conspiracy,"> should have a distrust for large power structures

capitalism supports large power structures too...  really, the question is do you want to be controlled by a few corporations who are only motivated by profit and un-elected CEOs, or by a group of nation-wide elected politicians.

The difference is that while a company can exert influence over me by being funded through a small group, elected representatives at least have some minor ties to their constituency.

In 90% of the ways it's exactly the same, sure.  But what matters is that with a representative government there is a process that exists to make change, even if it is very difficult.  Remember that the country broke up monopolies through government action in the past because things got bad enough.  And that change didn't happen because they stopped making money.

Pick your favorite evil political conglomerate and think about their funding sources and the influence they wield.  There is a lot of media that is funded by just a couple individuals, so even if large parts of the country boycott them, they lose no power.  On the other hand, people have gone around their reps and legalized marijuana by direct vote in several states, and others have done it at the state legislature level where reps are chosen by 30k people at a time..."

For example, in a standard cheap combination lock your third number cannot be greater than the second number and you can't have duplicate numbers.

Expected value on a single lottery draw can, and often does, exceed the cost of a ticket.  The lottery company doesn't lose money on those draws because that jackpot is the combination of several lottery draws.  

In the USA, for the powerball lottery, the jackpot starts at something like $40million with a drawing twice a week and keeps growing until someone wins.  That can take months sometimes leading to jackpots of several hundred million dollars.  

The odds of winning the jackpot are something around 1:300,000,000 and a ticket costs $2.  So if the jackpot exceeds $600Million, your expected value is greater than the cost of the ticket.  BUT the lottery doesn't lose money because that jackpot is the result of several lottery draws."

This is incorrect because lotteries have rolling jackpots.

Many many people disagree.  Which is why it's not a good thing to use as a base to build nonpartisan consensus.

> The entire point of 2a is to keep the government in check.

This is a side point unrelated to the discussion, but it's something that bothers me a lot.  The point of the second amendment is to keep the **Federal** government in check.  It's a minor, but very important difference.  Prior to 2008, this was agreed upon, but the gun lobby paid off politicians and judges until the republicans on the SCOTUS overturned established rulings based on flawed reasons (which they acknowledged) and ignored facts.

> Again both parties suck. We as people need to agree on this.

I guess my point is that you're picking issues that you feel strongly about and saying we need consensus about them.  But there is strong legitimate disagreement about a lot of these issues.  So I think if you're goal is to build nonpartisan consensus, we need to start elsewhere.  And there are more basic issues to address where there isn't such deep-rooted disagreement.

> It makes it hard to bribe people. I cannot see how you possibly could be against it.

This is going to get off topic, so I will just leave you with a couple reasons so that you can get an idea of why I wouldn't be readily on board with term limits.

1. It makes it easier to bribe people - If you can only work as a politician for a couple years, you need to make it count.  That means an increased incentive to line up cushy jobs when you are forced out in a couple years.  That means a greater incentive to take bribes to fund yourself when you are out of a job in a couple years.  
2. Being a politician is not something that a new person can be ultra effective at.  Just look at all the junior congressmen over the past 10 years and all the major problems they have caused.  Think of all the bills they unknowingly sabotaged by not understanding process.  When I vote for reps, I want someone who can work the system to my benefit.  Being loud and passionate != being effective.  
3. It's a small pool of people who are qualified and capable of being a good politician.  If someone gets elected who represents me well, I don't want to lose them just because of some arbitrary rule.  

One of the things to think about is that while most americans hate congress, they love their congressman.  Generally, we all want term limits because other people keep electing someone we don't like.  But that's what representative democracy is all about.  They elect someone they like, and you elect someone you like.  No matter how upset you are at their choice, it's still their choice.  

>  the problem is people play the ""my team good your team bad"" game

And why are they playing this game? Because money is paying to inundate them with this message.  Money is funding ""think tanks"" to support their candidate and divisive message.  Money is buying ads reinforcing hard divisions.  Money is hiding issues and increasing focus on others.  Money in politics is at or near the root of the issue.

> All of the above should not be a party issue it, it should be forced by the people.

But people don't agree on those things...  So who is going to force it?  These are things you care about, but not everyone agrees with you.  So it's not going to be forced, nor should it.  Just because it's an issue you feel strongly about does not make it nonpartisan..."

The problem with a lot of nonpartisan consensus issues is that we are all so taken by partisan talking points that 90% of people can't honestly consider issues objectively.

pussypassdenied,"This started off good, but then took a left turn part way through.  The initial premise of ""I don't believe it, you are not supporting your claim"" was OK (beginning until 1:10).

**Lets go through it**

> There are a-symmetries in all sorts of places

This claim has no evidence.  He handwaived away the claim that there is an asymmetry between men and women backed up by the example of sexual violence.  Without any counter example, and without any hedging with ""I believe"" or ""I think it is likely that"", he is just dismissing a claim and changing the subject.

> The fact that there are asymmetries has nothing to do with your basic argument

This isn't true.  The interviewer is making the implicit claim that the asymmetries provide evidence that there is a power dominance of men over women.

> [cuts off presenter]

And here is where this crosses a line from a disagreement in an interview into dishonesty.  By cutting the interviewer off before she could respond, he is starting to enter into the territory of gish gallop.  Basically, by adding more and more without letting them respond, the previous statements stand as true-by-default.  When they are actually contentious positions.

> it's not true [...] even if it has a patriarchal structure to some degree

So it's not a patriarchy, but it is?  His argument here is not clear.

> The fundamental basis of that structure is not power.

He is changing the topic.  See what happened here?  The original position was about ""a system of male dominance of society"" and he is now refuting it by saying it's not about power...  That's a complete non-sequitur.

> It's competence, that's why our society works.

This veers into casual sexism.  It sounds like the argument he is making is that men are dominant because they are the competent ones.  He doesn't back this claim up.  

And again, this is another topic change...  More gish gallop.

> It's only when tyranny ...

So now he is refuting the idea that it's about power.  Which is not a position the interviewer made.  It's a claim he made...  It's a straw man.

> Roving bands of tyrannical band of plumbers

This is not only a distracting absurdist claim, it's again changing the subject in a dishonest way.  And it's casually sexist to boot.   

The interviewer is not making the claim that the patriarchy is forcing people to hire only men.  So his point here is not addressing anything the interviewer said.  

> and and and then again

Again, he cuts off the interviewer to change the subject before she can respond.  This is gish gallop...  She isn't being given a chance to refute his points.  It's dishonest debating.

> western culture is by no means perfect

Again he just brushes away the actual topic without addressing it.  The argument here is about the ways in which it is not perfect...

> is the least tyrannical society

Just because it is the least tyrannical society does not mean that the patriarchy does not exist...  He isn't addressing the core claim of the argument.  

> You have no idea how ...

Again changing the subject.  So because it was not refuted (because he never gave them a chance to respond) it stands as true, and now the topic changes to why it's bad to push a falsehood (even though it wasn't proven false).

> death rate [...] starvation [...]  disease [...] raising children

What a subject change...

> it's a terrible thing to teach

Why?  He gave no evidence other than his own indignation about why it is a bad thing.

The point is, people will believe that if mother nature doesn't care about life then why should we?

So publicly repeating the idea that nature doesn't care only serves to breed further disinterest in protecting it.

No, it doesn't make sense to even say that though...  It's like saying ""My motorcycle is not red"" when I don't even own a motorcycle.  Saying mother nature doesn't care carries the connotation that our actions are ultimately inconsequential.  Really, I take issue with that because I hold the opposite to be true.

>  grants for infrastructure repairs

How do infrastructure repairs grow a city without gentrification?  Where does this money come from?  Where does this infrastructure go?  

Improved infrastructure is often the cause of gentrification...  New rail line brings TOD with hip condos and high priced apartments for young professionals.  New Highways get built through poor neighborhoods.  Improved streetscaping and parks attract buyers with more money, gentrifying a neighborhood.  New schools attract families, increasing competition, raising prices...

> zoning rules

Make gentrification worse or just flat out screw the poor...  

If you limit development to preserve neighborhoods, only the rich can afford the buildings that exist (what is happening today in cities).  

If you allow more development, you get predatory construction that screws the poor.  Just think about who has the money to fight a bad new development, rich or poor people?  The latter is pretty much exactly predatory gentrification, as developers can only afford low cost land.  Look into the history of zoning and building codes in major cities, and you will find developers screwing over the poor or ruining the city.  

> rent control

Doesn't work.  There have been thousands of papers, articles, and podcasts about this.  Rent control is terrible.

> development requirements

You will have to get specific here, as many of the ones that get proposed actually make things worse in the long run.  And those that don't, are largely ineffectual.  

--------------

The anger with ""Gentrification"" is misplaced.  We all want to live somewhere nice.  I want local grocery stores, good restaurants, beautiful housing, parks, community events, bike trails, ... And when you get all those things, surprise, everyone else wants to live there too.  The problem is not that things are getting better, but that people are getting pushed out.

So attack the problem with pushing people out instead of trying to stop ""gentrification"".

People get pushed out because there is not enough housing.
 There is not enough housing because not enough is being built.   Building 20 low income apartments won't help the thousands of middle class families struggling to find a house <$400k.  Requiring developers to include low-income apartments makes the rest of the building more expensive, again pushing out the middle class.

You effectively cannot grow a single city quickly without gentrification unless you want to live in dystopic a hellscape like kowloon.  If you want to fix the issue, it's going to take time, careful thought, and a lot of money."

The true motivation matters, because signals like this are the mechanism by which a market supposedly self-corrects.  *If I don't like your actions, I won't buy your products, forcing you to stop.  If I like your actions, I will encourage them with extra sales.  You want to maximize profit, so you will do what I, the consumer, want.*  However, if you lie about the motivations, then the market will not accurately respond to the consumer stimulus and the incentives change.  For example:

If the true motivation is just cheaper leather elsewhere, Brazil will be able to see through that lie.  They thus will incentivised to produce cheaper leather, and will have no incentive to stop the fires.

Consumers on the other hand don't have economists and teams of market analysts, and so will likely be mislead.  They will buy more products from Vans and Timberlands signaling that they like the action.  But because van's was lying, there is no actual change happening in the company.  Next time a supplying country does something bad, Vans can just lie again, or do nothing.  Brazil's actions haven't changed since Vans was lying, so the consumer's voice in the market is effectively silenced.  

The markets in this way are asymmetrical, because a country has funds and experts who can see through the lies, whereas individual consumers may not be able to.  And so anti-consumer behavior goes unpunished and the market remains uncorrected.  Thus, the real motivation behind an action is important."

And for someone working multiple jobs, it can be difficult/impossible to make up the hours by taking someone else's shift.

Let's say they make $10/hour:

delusionalartists,"> exposing his early work makes sense because you can see what he later in life went towards and it provides you context.

You seem to agree with the idea of showing the magritte early crap because it showcased the development of a career in surrealism that spawned beautiful artwork.  But what I am suggesting is that this drawing of 4 oranges should be shown because it showcased the development of minimalism itself.

Surrealism led to some visually stunning works of art as well as influenced whole genres of literature.  Minimalism led to a whole range of art that is so pervasive it is in everything from logos to websites to interior design.  In that sense, exposing this early work provides the same type of context that Magritte's early work does.  

> please show me one if his piece that objectively scream talent

But we already agreed that museum piece can be about providing context, so talent is not the right qualifier.  At that Magritte exhibit I referenced, they also showcased several similarly crappy drawings by his friends, who never produced beautiful artwork.  However, their drawings were showcased because they provided context and history in the same way the ancient pottery did.

But ignoring that, the talent in this artist is more about composition and insight into emerging styles than just technical painting abilities.  Large blocks of color in various shapes or arrangements play off a building's architecture and create interesting visuals that many find pleasing.  And later works of simple clean white shapes provide interesting contrast that I personally enjoy.

> I'll delete my comments on this post and admit you were right

No, don't delete anything.  This is not about being right or wrong.  This is not about some aesthetic sensibility you lack.  It's okay to not like a work of art and I don't particularly care for this one myself.  I just want to help you understand why this particular thing is in a museum. 

Hopefully that helps."
delusionalartists,"> But unless you use some mental gymnastic and stroke your ego to ""understand the path of the artist, the context, history of art"" etc, it's still four shitty circle.

Museums are filled with literal garbage.  Like broken pottery from 4,000 years ago was unearthed from an ancient garbage dump, and it's now on display. 
 That doesn't make it less valuable.  The broken pottery is museum worthy because it has a story attached to it.  Sure, I made more technically impressive pottery in 2nd grade, but that's not the point of it being in a museum.

A couple years ago I saw an exhibit on rene magritte.  It was a telling about his life's work and his developmental process.  Early works had quickly drawn line clouds with the word ""horse"" on them, and look like a 2 year old drew them.  But those images paved the way for paintings like ""The treachery of images"" and were foundational for surrealism as a movement.  It was exploring the idea that the paintings were not the actual objects and thus don't have to follow the same rules.  That lead to pictures like ""Golconda"" by magritte which many view as impressive, enjoyable, and now very famous works of art.

So even though the crappy drawing of a cloud with the word horse written on it is objectively bad, it is still museum worthy because of the story."

But in terms of miles, that measurement is built into the fabric of the land here.

(look at satellite view of Oregon, and see how the tree harvests make a checkerboard? Or look at roads in farmland kansas) Even major cities are laid out on a grid with larger roads placed exactly 1 mile apart.  As a result, A university might be set on exactly a square mile, and a farm may take up 1 square mile as well.  As a kid walking around, 1 mile was easily understandable, because walking between big streets would be 1 mile.  So 1 sq mi shouldn't be that tough for average people.

Using acres is more analogous in usage to hectares for you.  It's used primarily in terms of land for buying/selling.  Hobby farmers know how big an acre is and when buying a house you usually see how large the lot is listed in acres (1/8 or 1/4 acre is common for residential lots).  

An american football field is just a bit larger than an acre, so it's somewhat common to casually describe area in terms of 'football fields' which is basically describing things in acres.

nobody hit andy with a pipe.  Andy got punched twice after shoving his cameras in people's faces and calling them facists... for three hours.  If you watched his videos, he reported several people to the police for telling him to leave, and then returned, and the got told to leave again, and then after calling people names got a milkshake poured on him, and then went to the police, and then returned, and then finally got attacked...

That doesn't justify someone punching him, but I think it's important context to understand that Andy is not a good person.  He was trying to get hit so he could go to the media.  ...His online donation page pulled in ~$200k from that.

This whole antifa used a pipe meme is absurd.  That guy wasn't attacked with a pipe, it was a cane.  And the guy who was attacked started the fight...  Watch the videos (not the edited cuts on fox, but the full videos).  A guy grabs an antifa person from behind and drags them away in a chokehold, that guy then gets hit so he would let go of the person he attacked, then the guy (who is pictured bloody and who everyone is saying was innocent and attacked with a pipe) jumped into the fight to attack antifa.  There are videos showing that guy being aggressive before that, and it's obvious he was there looking for a fight.

That whole thing was from 2012, when al qaeda was a much more pressing issue.  It was about a year after bin laden was killed, and during a time when the group's leadership was in flux and threats were much more regular.

It was also during Obama's whole russia ""reset"" strategy that fox news and the GOP were desperate to torpedo.  The spoken reason for that position was just to make obama look bad, but the unspoken reason was obviously due to arms sales, nuclear weapons, and oil.  The MIC needs enemies with money, and increased tensions with russia would make a lot of people a lot of money.

That is incorrect.  The premise of an argument has to rely on attacking a person.  That is fundamental to what an ad hominem is.  And I showed that that argument above does not have such a premise, and I also explained why you are confusing ad hominem with other fallacies.  Since I expect you to disagree, let me provide an example to show why attacking a person is not inherently an ad hominem:

    All people who do X are bad
    Andy does X
    Therefore Andy is bad

The above is not an ad hominem.  It's not even fallacious.  In fact it is a valid argument.  You cannot make a fallacy with a valid argument, because valid arguments are inherently non-fallacious.  And this example attacks a person.  Therefore your claim is incorrect."
libertarianmeme,"I'm going to get pedantic here:

In the context of the discussion, the statement ""Your argument is wrong"" is the conclusion.  It's also true that no premises are given to support that conclusion, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a conclusion.  And because that conclusion is drawn without attacking the person, it is thus not an ad hominem.  

""therefore you are stupid/a nazi"" is a second conclusion, to which the previous conclusion of ""your argument is wrong"" is used as the premise.  The premise of the argument is not unrelated attacks on the person, so this conclusion is therefore also not an ad hominem.  

> avoiding answering the question followed by personal insult.

This is a correct description, but the key is that the argument is not *relying* on the insult.  And that is what makes something an ad hominem specifically.  

I think where you are getting confused is that ad hominem is a structural fallacy very similar to a fallacy that the quoted argument could be accused of committing.  An ad hominem is not fallacious because it attacks the person, it's fallacious because attacking the person is irrelevant to the argument, which leaves the conclusion of the argument unsupported.  In the above, the conclusion ""your argument is wrong"" is unsupported.  The personal insult in the second conclusion is just a red herring.

Hopefully that clarifies things."

If you are going to install a switched outlet, put it somewhere that I would want to put a lamp.  i.e. somewhere dark that is difficult to access in the dark, or more than 10 feet from the switch.  

The worst thing I have seen often enough is when people choose a fancy light for a kitchen that ends up casting shadows onto the counter when you are working.  Also, I have been in 2 houses where the under cabinet lights can be seen directly when sitting on a couch in the next room over.  Some people like using the under-cabinet lights as dim lights when watching a movie (so you can walk through the kitchen, but it's still dark in the living room) and if you have a bright LED or halogen shining at you when your on the couch, that kinda ruins that...

Also, in terms of kitchen layout, make it easy to put away groceries.  I lived in one place where there was no counter space next to the fridge, so it took a lot of walking back and forth to put away stuff.  And if you do have counter space, make sure the fridge (if you are leaving one) opens the right way, so that you can put groceries away easily.

I strongly disagree with that statement.  Strongly.

I started a nonprofit a few years ago, and we had ~20 volunteers who donated a bunch of time and effort to get it up and running.  The organization did everything BUT profit.  And yet, we were all still motivated to make it work as best as we could.  If you have ever worked with a serious non-profit, you know that those people aren't slacking.  We were motivated by the mission of the organization.  And because of the nonprofit status, people were taking minimum pay (and no pay) and constantly coming up with creative solutions to stretch each dollar as far as humanly possible.  

Also, charter schools are not definitively better.  There is a lot of debate about that currently, because most of the stats are inflated by things like selection biases and shifted costs.

> Better schools can charge more for that very reason which in turn allows the stratification of students. That's a good thing.

But this whole thread is about college being too expensive...  And I would argue that a country where poor kids are unable to attend good schools is worse than one with equal education opportunities.  Who's to say that trailerpark terry isn't the next bill gates?  But when they can't afford a good school, they may never get the chance to reach that high.  This is social inertia and is a well studied concept.

> These colleges are choosing to charge more because people are choosing to continue paying for education that is far too expensive. [...] You literally cannot work and pay your through college anymore.

So why would dropping federally backed loans change that?  If the market is willing to pay the current price, why would *costs to the students* go down?  They are willing to pay the current prices afterall...

And before you say that federal loans allow them to take more risk than they otherwise would, don't forget that federal loans are capped well below the expensive college rates we are talking about.  I maxed out my federal loans at <$50k. Anything over that would have had to come from a private lender, and I had several friends at a state university who left with $25k in private loan debt on top of their federal loans.  So it's clear that private lenders are already willing to lend to students.

> Staying the same is better than this apparent exponential increase

Who's to say that we ever reached equilibrium before federally backed student loans?  During the same time we had a large increase in population, college became a requirement, and a whole lot of very expensive things became mandatory for education.  You picked a conclusion without considering other factors.

> The universities are getting far more money per student than they were 10 years ago. HEA was passed in 2008

Tuition has been going up much longer than just 10 years.  in the 60s a minimum wage job worked part time during the summer could pay for ivy league schools.  

> Private student loan companies keep people who would pursue useless degrees in check at least

I have seen no evidence supporting that statement.

> Why do you think there is market saturation among jobs which require an English degree, communications degree, and other non-STEM fields?

Because with the advent of mass media, the internet, and modern technology, one person is much more productive with a wider reach than they were in the past.  A single person can now do the work of an entire team a couple decades ago, and a publication that reached 100k people 30 years ago now reaches over a million.

Libertarian,"> Then stop giving out government funded student loans

But the government is the one and only institution that can do things on a large scale without a profit motive.  That's the point of government loans.  They absorb the risk, because the government is the only entity that derives benefit from a widely educated population.

> rapid increase in college tuition costs

Tuition costs are different than loan interest rates.  This image macro is silly, because it's mixing the two.  You can dislike bankers profiting and be perfectly happy with educators profiting.  There is nothing hypocritical about that.  Libertarians will disagree, but it's not hypocrisy.

> Colleges gonna keep raising prices if kids are guaranteed government money

Okay, lets look at the FULL picture here.  

Prices are ALWAYS going to increase until the profit is maximized.  That's econ 101.  

If you get rid of government backed loans, then private loans will fill the gap.  Those loans will have higher interest rates, which means for the same price to the students, the universities will get less money.  So college students will still pay the same price.  

BUT, because universities will get less money for each student, they will either raise prices, cut staff, or both.  That's how economics works.  The end result is either students pay more, or less students attend university.  Both of which are objectively bad for the country.

This whole ""blame government loans"" is only looking at the first order effect, and not looking at what the alternative would mean."

> What's the problem with independent stations? Are there only so many frequencies to tune into?

Yes.

When looking at [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum), we typically classify them by their frequency.  Xrays, light, wifi, Cellphones, over the air TV, Radio stations, personal radios, and RFID are all operating on the same EM spectrum, just at different frequencies. 

When two things are broadcasting at the same frequency, they interfere with each other.  It's why 2.4ghz wifi may slow down when you use your kitchen microwave.  As a result, any EE can easily build a radio jammer that does scary things like preventing someone from calling 911.  And so the government had to step in and regulate things.  (Don't want firefighter's radios to go down, blocking 911 calls on a highway would be terrible, commercial radio stations by law have to broadcast tornado and hurricane warnings and people could die if they don't get that memo...)

So, we break up the EM spectrum into ""bands"" that are reserved for certain applications.  Satellites use one range of frequencies, TV uses another, Radio uses another, emergency responders use yet another.

As an example, in the United States, the government set aside the EM frequency of 87.5 MHz to 108 MHz for FM radio.  So, a new music radio station might register to broadcast an electromagnetic signal at 90.1 MHz (90,100,000 Hz).  We usually refer to the stations by the MHz number and signal so 90.1 FM.  However, due to the way antennas and electronics are designed, a radio tuned to 90.2 MHz (90,200,000 Hz) can probably still pick up that station.  So any station on 90.2MHz would be interfering with 90.1MHz and vice-versa.  This is the reason why radio stations are spaced .2 apart (90.1FM and 90.3FM).  Because of the 0.2 spacing requirement, there can be at most 102 FM radio stations in a single area. (for practical reasons, you will never see that many and usually see far less)

Broadcasting on a narrow band is actually pretty difficult, and a lot of hobby equipment is not precise enough.  So pirate stations frequently bleed over many radio stations and get reported almost immediately even if they were broadcasting in a dead space.  And finding a station is pretty easy, as all you need is a signal meter and a car."

Why do we need a transition plan?  You are suggesting that we build more outward without a plan to move people around.  How many lanes do you want to add to 26?  How many lanes do you want to add to 5?  Where are you going to get extra lanes for 405?  Again, you are suggesting building outward while ignoring the infrastructure needs and infrastructure impact of building outward.  Why is widening roads and building more freeways easier than adding another street car line?  Why is building another SFH neighborhood and adding another freeway easier than building condos in the city?  Why is building houses 30 minutes from jobs not require a transit plan, but building apartments walking distance to jobs needs a massive plan?

You have to look at these problems in a per-capita basis.  

> We haven’t even considered what good roadway design can do to mitigate those factors.

I am discussing not adding more roads.  I felt it was pretty self-explanatory why that would not increase noise, light, and air pollution.

Roads also create **induced demand**.  So regardless of good design, you will wind up with traffic and pollution.  If you really don't understand my previous explanations of suburbs externalizing costs, I would recommend reading up on the concept of induced demand.  That should lead you down a good primer about how freeways make private vehicles artificially cheap.

> Suburbs exist because of cheap land in a place nobody wants to build urban infrastructure on.

**Ah-ha!**  we found it.  This is what you are missing:

Suburbs do have urban infrastructure, the infrastructure just isn't in the suburb.  That's the problem I am trying to explain.  A large part of the freeway is infrastructure to support the suburbs commuting to work (that's why they were all built post-ww2 when people moved to the burbs).  Because of the burbs low density, public transit doesn't work, so they use cars.  Those cars need parking.  That means offices, restaurants, concert halls, stadiums, etc. all need enough parking and roads to support the influx of cars.  This is suburban infrastructure in the city.  Portland existed long before highways, and large chunks of the city were demolished to make way for the suburban highways.  

The infrastructure of your house is not contained just on your house's lot.  Your neighborhood has a long water main from the treatment plant to the gate which exists to support you and your neighbors.  Even though that line is nowhere near your house, it still exists to serve your house.  So your ""share"" of the water pipes is the length of main in front of your house + your share of the main that serves your neighborhood.  In a city, that shared portion is split among WAY more people. This is the same for electric, sewers, roads, etc.  

In terms of freeways, this is the same with the 4th lane on the freeway.  Part of that infrastructure is your share.  And you are putting it in the city far away from your house.  You don't want to live next to a highway, but you still made the highway worse elsewhere to support that.  You wanted to be able to drive through the city quickly, so you made the city noisier and more polluted.  This is analogous to you dumping your garbage in the city because you don't want your neighborhood to smell.  This is not about me not wanting to pay for others, this is about suburbs taking advantage of the city for their own gain.

> [because of cheap land] If you want to end suburbs, you need to build ahead of population growth, which we are terrible at.

Again, this is what I am trying to explain:  As long as we are making the cost of suburbs artificially cheap by paying for their highways and infrastructure people will build.  And building outward makes everything worse.  (Again, read up on the concept induced demand if you don't fully understand my previous explanations)

We can't build ahead of population growth by building outward.  We can't.  Suburban infrastructure INCLUDES urban infrastructure like highways and public transit.  And when you build outward ""because the land is cheap"", you are ignoring the cost of the rest of the suburban infrastructure.

The same way they do today? The same way they have for the past 150 years.  Just stop building outward and instead build inward and up.  Build around existing transit.

> The point is to invest in infrastructure that benefits society as whole.

My point is that suburbs take more than is fair, and they don't actually benefit society.  They pollute more, they consume more, they cause more damage to the land, they make cities worse, they reduce tax efficiency, they waste land, they waste money.

> it's heavily reliant on cities and economies becoming insular

How?  I am arguing against suburbs taking resources from the city to fund themselves.  I am arguing against building more freeways to support unsustainable outward growth."
Portland,"> How is the city subsidizing them if not through taxation?

First indirect subsidies:

1. The roads are on public property.  Expanding roads uses public land to support them.
2. The cars are driving longer to work, groceries, etc., and thus damaging more road than other citizens.  Roads are paid for collectively, so those people are using more road than they are paying for.
3. Because they have to drive places, those places need parking.  Parking reduces the tax base of a lot of land.  Which means that there is less taxes to support that land (police, fire, water, roadwork, sewer, water, government, etc.).  But because people are coming from farther around, they are still supporting the same number of people.  
4. Higher traffic roads cause more noise which creates more noise pollution, which makes the surrounding areas worse.  There is a real property value loss when a highway gets busier and wider.  But no one is paying those people for the decrease in value to their home.  The people commuting are not paying anyone for the noise.
5. More driving means more pollution.  They don't pay any extra for the pollution their cars produce, but they produce more than I do.
6. Roads need street lights which adds light pollution.  They are not compensating me for the damage that light pollution causes.  In the city, the light load is split among more people, where less people use more light in the burbs.
7. Suburbs built on farmland mean there is less land being farmed to produce the same amount of food.  This means more fertilizers in use, and more intensive farming practices, which is more damaging to the land and environment.  Farmable land is a public resource in the sense that it supports us all.  Suburbs are using up that public resource.
8. SFHs are less efficient with resources, which means more land and resources need to be used to sustain them.  More forests need to be logged to support their structures.  More cement needs to be produces for their roads.  More electricity generated to power their homes.  More gas drilled to heat during the winter.  Each of those things has externalized costs.  Externalized costs are effectively subsidies paid by everyone else.  

Direct subsidies:

They are getting it through taxes in two ways:

1. The problem is that suburbs are not paying their fair share.  Houses are often times ~50 feet apart.  that means each house is effectively using 50 feet of pipe.  If pipes are replaced, they need to replace 50 feet of pipe per house.  In an apartment, I share my water main with 200 people, so in the city, I am effectively using only 1 foot of pipe.  Now the water rates are different between residential and multi-family, but the problem is that they don't pay for their full cost.  My rates are slightly higher than they need to be to pay for them. (one of the urban planning blogs had a good writeup, but I can't find it atm)  And the same thing goes for sewer and electricity.  
2. Lower densities mean less tax revenue per acre of land.  that grocery store with 1 acre of parking brings in less property tax to support schools than the grocery store with underground parking in the city center.  That means I am effectively paying for their schools.  A strip mall has a lower tax base than a mixed use development on hawthorn.  200 condos on one block in downtown are paying 20x the taxes as a block of single family homes.  

> What is your suggestion to stop them from expanding?

First, just disallow it where reasonable.  Things like the urban growth boundary, zoning changes, development restrictions.  The unpopular stuff...

Second, make suburbs actually pay for their full costs.  You do this through taxes and making sure that public resources are fairly paid for.  I shouldn't have to pay for widening 26 since I live in downtown and the traffic is coming from new developments out west.  Road infrastructure for suburbs partly comes from pooled funds, and so individuals out there are getting more tax money than their fair share.  

> I can't even get a sidewalk built in my neighborhood

Because you don't pay enough in taxes to prioritize it.  How wide is your property?  75'?  That's your share of sidewalk to pay for, and you already have loads of other services to pay for.  

> I would love if that could happen by alternate transit

It will never happen if we keep building suburbs.  They are too expensive to service with transit.  That's what I am saying about them being a terrible thing.  We can't serve them properly with busses, so we have to have a lot of roads for them.  Building more of them means more roads, which necisitates more parking, which makes the city less dense, which means more cars, which means more roads, which...  ...That's why California sucks."
Portland,"The densest area in Oregon is a trailer park.  [Johnson City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_City,_Oregon)

We can get denser faster than we can sprawl outward. Sprawling outward is a bad investment.  Sprawl requires roads which everyone pays for.  Adding more people without widening the highways makes it harder for everyone else along that road to commute.  Adding people where they don't need a road doesn't have that effect.  I walk to the grocery store, walk to the park, take the max to the airport.  People in Beaverton Drive to the Store, Park out front, Drive to the city, park in a structure, drive to the airport, park in a lot, drive to the park, park on the road...

> the suburbs are thriving

Because the city is subsidising them.  Those water pipes to every house?  Their long-term maintenance costs are not covered by their taxes and fees so in 50 years guess who will be paying?  Their roads?  Not covered by their taxes and fees again.  The highways are clogged because they live so far away that they have to take the highway to get to work. Guess who pays for helping them commute to work?

> We have to address the problem from multiple angles if we're to get ahead.

But we shouldn't be investing in something that will make the problem worse.  Building more burbs will make the problem worse.  What is the cost to expand 405?  What is the cost to expand the 26 tunnel?  What is the cost to add a lane to 5?  Doing all of those would easily cost $1B, which could instead subsidise 20,000 apartments and condos in the city center at $50k each.  And those would be sharing water mains, sharing roads, sharing trains, sharing street cars, sharing grocery stores, patronizing existing restaurants and shops, walking to parks, not filling parking garages during the day."
Portland,"> because they can't afford to live closer

They can't afford to live closer because of zoning requirements for cars and the lack of public transportation in the cities.

If we don't address the problem now, and keep feeding the machine that is pushing people outwards, we will end up like california where roads suck, and most people have >1 hour commutes.  

So by not providing an alternative, you are implicitly accepting the alternative of ""more cars, more expensive housing, worse cities"".  That's what I am saying.

> We can't stuff everybody in a single zip code, this isn't Sky City.

Paris is only 5 stories tall, and matching their density would allow us to quadruple the population of portland (proper) in the same space.  Allow greater FAR and increase heights in downtown portland, and we could easily add another 100k people in downtown.  Add a couple more max lines and allow greater densities of TOD, and we can easily add 500k more people to the region without any outward growth.

> you still need adequate capacity to get to and from the city from elsewhere.

My point is that we already have more than enough capacity.  The problem is that we are making it too cheap to use.  Like imagine if concerts were priced at $1/ticket.  They would sell out and we would need more concert venues, and we wouldn't be able to afford to maintain the buildings because they don't bring in enough money.  That's what we have today with road transit.  The problem isn't that we need more, it's that what we have is too cheap for people to use.  And the price in the case of highways is not tolls, it's in terms of externalized costs and time savings.  We shouldn't be subsidizing people to live in Gresham and work in Hillsboro.  That's what highways do.

> and make existing infrastructure greener and more efficient.

And we don't do that by building more highways.  That's all I am saying.  Make better use of what we have now.  Build apartments near the MAX, fill the parking lots near the street cars, Allow greater heights and densities in the south waterfront, give incentives to build denser on the east side near the street cars.  Build additional max lines to move people without cars instead of adding more highway lanes and parking structures.  Tax parking lots of certain businesses in commercial zones to pay for busses.  Encourage biking.  

The land exists to be more dense.  Let's use it and build public transit to support that density rather than sprawling outward onto farms and expanding highways.

Like, the height limit of downtown is 460'.  The south waterfront can't really be over 31 stories tall (and all the lots of that height are developed now anyway).  The one tall building on the east side will probably always be the tallest because of the council.  That is hampering our density and pushing people into the burbs.  Those people need cars.  Those cars need parking spaces.  Those people in those cars sit in traffic polluting.  There is a single complex in new york that has more people than the whole south waterfront.  

TL;DR - Highways suck and adding more is not the answer.  We need to be working toward a denser core, and we don't get that by building highways."
Portland,"On the roads or trains?  I'm not suggesting demolishing *all* roads, I am just suggesting not building new ones and not subsidizing personal cars any more."
Portland,"Well, unfortunately, there is no way around this problem.  We can't keep building highways and sprawling outward (Just look at california).  So if you don't want to live near an apartment building, then you can pay the cost.  The way it should work is if you want something, you need to pay for it.  And the problem with today's city is that other people are subsidizing SFHs and Personal cars by paying for the highways and infrastructure that feed the services that the SFHs rely on.  

""paying for it"" is going to be traffic, fees for personal cars, and very expensive housing (for single family homes with a yard).  

> I respectfully disagree

Portland,"> the greatest part of living in Oregon is being surrounded by nature

And we conserve that nature by densifying the city.  Things like forest park make quick excursions without vehicles possible.  And for weekend travel, it's easy to catch a bus to wine country, or rent a car to the forest or coast.  Having a personal car 24/7 isn't the only way to experience nature. 

> have to live in a crowded city just to work?

Dense doesn't have to mean crowded.  In a bigger city (like portland) the core can be very crowded at the right time.  But not all living areas have to be as BIG as portland.  Make beaverton's core more dense, and then train from beaverton to portland.  Make the core of all oregon cities more dense instead of sprawling outwards.  A 5 story apartment building can contain many blocks worth of houses in less than a single block.  In St Johns, 1 block holds 22 houses, A condo taking up 1/4 of that block could hold 40 (5 stories) fill that block with 4 condos, and put a park on the block across the street, and now you have 4 times the density with more green space, and justification for a bus stop at your front door.

When people think ""urban density"" they are thinking cold windy urban canyons.  But higher density can mean much more pleasant things.  Many areas around the world are much easier without a car, and we should be working toward that.  Change is scary, but for 90% of people, it's just fear instead of real issues."
Portland,"> But that’s assuming someone wants to live in the city

> Realistically there will always be people pushed to the suburbs

> and that won’t transition overnight.

Then we better get started now."
Portland,"> Even with a 100% switch to renewable power we're still going to need freeways

Okay, this one is complicated:

Freeways are essentially subsidies for cars.  They are externalizing the costs of personal transit.  And cars are artificially cheap because all the negatives of cars and freeways are born by the public instead of the individual using the car.

* Cars are noisy.  Government allowing more roads means individuals aren't paying for their noise pollution.  Property values drop near freeways.  Animals don't live near freeways due to noise and danger.

* Cars produce a lot of pollution, but no one is paying for the fumes in the atmosphere that is damaging insects and our health.

* Roads (freeways) are paving over valuable land leaving an area that does not contribute to the local ecosystem.

* Roads (freeways) disrupt animal movements by making uncrossable boundaries.

* Roads (freeways) take up land that could be used for housing close to the city core.  Less density means people need to live further away.  Which means more drivers because coverage area is proportional to the square of distance to the city, and covering a large area with public transit is very expensive.

* Freeways incentivise driving to the city, and thus you need more parking in the city.  More parking means a less walkable city due to lower density.  This makes the city worse for walking and makes public transit less efficient for others.

You can continue this train of thought for a long time.  Cars suck.  And because the problems with roads and cars affect everyone, and are not captured in the cost of gas, time, and direct costs, they are basically incentivised over public transit at the cost of public transit.

malelivingspace,"> How do those of you who are single, with pets insure their safety?

Depends on what you are worried about.  

For fire, there is not much you can do other than reduce fire risks.  Don't have paper towels sitting next to a gas stove.  If you are really worried about them turning on the stove, you can probably take off the knobs so they can't accidentally bump it.  But you should probably just work on training them to never ever jump on the counter (just to avoid the whole situation in the first place).

Your dog shouldn't really get into trouble as long as they are not super destructive.  Don't keep poisonous house plants, don't place heavy objects in a place where they could injure your dog.  Keep medicine and poisons in a place where they could never get to them (in a sealed box or inside a cabinet they can't reach).  

But really, the #1 thing is going to be making sure you exercise your dog enough.  A tired dog is a good dog.  And a good dog will get into much less trouble (and cause your neighbors less trouble).  Go for a long walk in the morning, and another when you get back.  

> Would the fire department come out for a dog?

The fire department will come out for a fire.  If the structure is safe to enter (as a firefighter), they will get your dog when they get there.  The only thing that could complicate that situation is if your dog gets defensive enough to make it impossible for the firefighter to rescue.  This can be fixed through training and socializing.  

> I dont plan to crate him.

One thing I have read is that a crate (and proper crate training) can be really helpful for the dog when you are gone.  It gives them a safe space, a little cave, where they can not worry when their owner is away.  

> How long would new wooden stairs be usable in case of fire?  Is it safer that the stairs are actually outside of the building?

Long enough.  Yes.  Fire codes are such that it takes a while to engulf a whole building, and apartment conversions usually entail fire safety changes before the inspector will sign off on the occupancy permit.  

------------

As long as this is a smaller building (sounds like it is), I wouldn't worry much about fire.  Definitely check the batteries in the smoke detectors, get a connected one if it makes you feel better.  If fire is something that is really on your mind, call the fire department and have a chat on safety precautions.  Information and safety training is part of their mission and as long as the marshall isn't busy, they are usually happy to help.

If the idea of being away really scares you, make friends with your neighbors.  If you are gone they may be quicker to help."

malelivingspace,"I will give a couple bits of advice:

1\. Everything is really blocky.  Your sectional, couch, tv/stand, windows, table, vents, and door are all super rectangular.  You need to break it up a bit.  Softer shapes like plants, curtains, or a lamp can add some more visual interest

2\. Everything is kindof the same height, and it's making it bland.  The table, couch, sectional, and tv stand are all the same height, and the coffee table matches the couch cushion height too.  You need something to draw the eye up and down.  Get a lower side table.  Get a rug.  Add a tall plant, or put some plants in the windows.  Add some pictures on the walls.  Add something that goes from floor to ceiling.  You want to connect the heights, not keep them the same.

3\. Color.  You need some.  Right now you have black, glass, white, brown.  The TV is a big black void sucking up the center of the room.  The dark gray sectional is in shadow and taking up a lot of light.  The black couch is another mass of black on the same area as the TV.  You have some colorful pillows it looks like, but the light is blocked by the sectional orientation, so they don't help the room at all.

4\. The room looks a bit bland because you have a bunch of white on top with no features, and a bunch of black on the bottom with no features.  You need to blend that divide and soften each one.  Add some color (nothing bold) up high, less black down low.

5\. The couch next to the door feels cramped.  It takes up a large area visually, and makes the space feel filled while weighing down the floor.  If you can replace it with something lighter, that would be a massive improvement.  

**Suggestion #1**

Okay, I would ditch the couch by the door.  If you really need the extra seating, replace it with a chair and ottoman.  Or just anything that allows you to see some floor below it.  Preferable something lighter in color (gray would be easy) or something with a *little* bit of color (blue, green, amber)

I would replace the TV stand with something less 90s and more contemporary or classic.  I would strongly recommend going with something that is not black and glass.  The TV already is so dark that you don't want to overpower the room with a black tv stand.

Replace the table in the corner with something that goes with the new TV stand.  Put a lamp on that table to break up the hard lines in that corner.  I think a vase lamp with a nice shade would do wonders for that corner.  Or if you don't need that table, then replace it with a floor lamp -- tripods are classic, it would help bridge the horizontal and vertical lines, and would add some visual height to that area.  

Get some life in the room.  I would put some small plants on the left windowsill.  If you are into succulents, find some small colorful pots (check local stores and etsy) and put something fun inside them.  If you want more green, you could do something that will hang down the ledge.  I'm thinking something like a heartleaf philodendron, but go chat with a nursery to find something that will work for the light you get (don't know what direction those windows face).  If you ditch the or table, you might have enough floor space to go with a leafy potted plant on the floor.  

Put some art on the walls.

**Suggestion #2**

Rotate the room counter-clockwise 90 degrees.  Put the TV in the corner next to the door, have the sectional sit below the windows and back wall. replace the black couch with a lounge chair and have that floating where the sectional sits now.  Then throw in some plants, maybe an arc lamp to hang over the sectional.  Get a colorful throw blanket on the sectional."

Addressing the cause for everyone at the same time puts everyone at the same starting point...

Like look at the youth criminal pipeline.  That disproportionately affects black communities.  Some of the biggest causes toward that are poor parents, lack of community services, limited afterschool programs, and similar community failings.  And once you are in it, your kids are going to be stuck there too.  These are all things that build negative social inertia.

Funding schools properly, providing youth programs equally without regard to zipcode income, making minimum wage liveable, and improving the impartiality of criminal justice sentencing would all resolve that part of the problem.  None of which have anything to do with race.  Black communities as an entity will benefit most since they are affected by it at most, but the point is that you are not ignoring others when fixing a problem.  Poor white kids in shitty areas will also be less likely to wind up in jail.  

Intentionally ignoring poor asian americans or white americans or what-have-you americans won't make the problems of the black community easier.  All that does is breed resentment everywhere else.

Example:  ""That conspiracy theorist believes the earth is flat.  Therefore they must be crazy because only crazy people believe the earth is flat.

2. It gets stuck under furniture that is the wrong height.  It wedges itself under my fridge and kitchen island somehow, and can't escape.  Which means I have to rescue it, or fence off that area.
3. It knocks things over if they are not secure.  I have things leaning against the wall, and roomba will knock them down if they are not heavy enough.
4. It will eat cords.  If you have a phone charger cable lying about, it will suck it up, and can damage them.  You have to roomba-proof your place when you first get it.
5. The charger makes a really high-pitched almost inaudible buzzing noise.  If you are older, you probably can't hear it, but if you are sensitive to noises like that, it can get annoying.
6. The roomba dock needs to be taped down to the floor, because roomba will knock it around and fail to dock.

Bank notes only have power because the government says they do, and because they mandate it.  They can do the same with anything digital.  I don't fear a bank stealing my digital money any more than I fear them stealing physical bank notes.  So that's a non-issue.  There is government involved at the same level as paper money, so any way you feel safe with paper you should feel safe with digital.

The only issues I see with digital currency are: 

1. Transferrability - I can give $1 to someone without anyone knowing and no one can stop me.  VISA can deny my payment to a company they don't like.  BUT, with the right digital currency, I don't have to go through VISA.  So not a major concern.
2. Power Outages - Although this seems insurmountable now, I am not concerned long-term.  The power grid is becoming more decentralized and redundant.  Home batteries, solar, wind, tidal, etc. are all making a grid that won't have major outages in the near future.  So by the time that cash disappears completely, I don't expect to be worried about power.
3. Monitoring - Cash is ""untraceable"", but in practice, only so much.  Many digital currencies do have a record.  Although this is concerning, I don't think it will actually have any impact on life.  They can already track CCs, they can already use cellphone GPS, they can already use store cameras, license plate tracking, etc.  It's hard to fall off the grid these days, so we wouldn't lose anything major.

> How does a private individual, separate from a government, infringe on your rights?

Well, the simple answer is that it's easy for a private individual to violate your 13th amendment rights.  

Medium difficulty answer is that a coffee shop operating on government property that refuses to sell to black people is violating their 14th amendment rights.

Difficult answers:

What do you call rights, do you have an enumerated list?  The Declaration of Independence suggested that the pursuit of happiness was one.  Sexual harassment and hostile work environment for example can take away your ability to pursue happiness if you have no other job options.  Does verbal assault at a park take away that right?  What if people are on every street corner, every school, every library, on the street outside your house, and in your workplace?  Are your rights being infringed then?

Do you have the right to an education?  Someone speaking freely, loudly, and often in class may disrupt your education and take away that right.  A student verbally harassing you in class may take away your ability to learn in that environment.

Is your right to exist infringed if everywhere you go people call you inferior and worthless?  It's irresponsible to deny human psychology, and we are all actually emotionally very fragile.  Goading people into suicide is a thing.  Verbally harassing LGBT people until they feel so worthless that they kill themselves is a real issue.  Does beating someone to death violate their rights?  Is verbally assaulting someone until they commit suicide really any different?

Is it valuable when it's someone with 10 million followers telling it to you in front of all of them?

malelivingspace,"Rule of thumb is anything under 30% of your gross income is considered ""affordable"".  Obviously, the less you spend, the more money you can save to eventually buy a place, contribute to your retirement, take trips, or have fun.

Commute time is a big deal though, so make sure it works with your lifestyle.  I used to live 20 minutes from work, and that made lunch-time errands difficult.  20 minutes home, 20 minutes back to work, only leaves 20 minutes to get stuff done over a lunch hour.  What value you place on that is really personal.  For me, commute time is worth about $300/month ($3600/year).  Which prices my commute time at something like ~$21/hour.  But with wear and tear on my car, gas, my real cost for commute time is different.  If your commute is 15 miles, and you get 30mpg, that's 1 gallon of gas to commute per day.  @$3/gallon, that's $61/month in gas.

Also depends on your lifestyle.  I like walking around a city, so I pay a premium to live in a city that entertains me.

SO:

* If only one place is affordable, go with that place.
* If both places are affordable, look at commute time.
* Price your commute in terms of $.  Gas, car repair, value of your time.
* How much are you willing to spend to be in a particular area
* Are there other things you want, and what is the value of those things.

conspiracy,"> I could explain to you the various types of CNC machines available today.,,but there is absolutely nothing that exists on that mega scale that could handle those multi ton polygonal stones.

Ive built CNC machines...  It's not hard to scale them up, and they are custom made all the time in large factories overseas.  Milling machines have to be large enough to make ship's engines.  Those engines are MASSIVE, and have many parts that are precision machined.  The crankshafts on them are often a single piece, extremely heavy, and have to be very precise rotationally.  

FOR EXAMPLE: http://www.mtsq.co.uk/waldrichsiegen/

That has milling machines capable of handling 10m X 10m, and lathes that can handle 500 tonnes with a diameter of 7m.

The largest stones in the walls you are talking about are smaller than that.  And that machines I linked are capable of higher precision than those stones.  It's also not the largest one in existence by any stretch.

> to get all the other stones to fit around that one, and all the others to fit around that one is a mind bender all on its own.

Today with modern modeling software, it's a pain sure, but far from impossible.  Back then, they probably did a sanding fit.  They place one block, then set the next one on top of it and push it back and forth until the texture of the stones sand themselves into two matching faces.  Lots of work, sure, but human labor was ""cheaper"" back then."

conspiracy,"> why? Because no one knows how to make them.

We know how to make them, the problem is cost.  3 ways to make polygonal blocks:

1. Modern tools - CNC Just put the rock in the cnc and click go.  Easy.  Takes a long time, and the CNCs are expensive.
2. Hand carving the same way we do sculpture.  Measure, chisel, measure again, etc.  Takes even longer, and human labor is a lot more expensive than it used to be.
3. The way they probably made these:  The rocks are heavy enough to crush small protrusions, and sand down bigger bumps if you slide the rocks back and forth until they meet flat.  Problem is that takes even more man power, and is a lot of work.

We can make things with much higher precision these days, and modern skyscrapers have much more complex materials than these stones.  We don't use polygonal stones due to weight, cost, and generally it's not in vogue.  Building solid masonry is long gone because those buildings have poor thermal performance, are high cost, and you can only build so tall before it becomes impractical.

Portland,"> The fact that it's based on number of people in Congress, which is itself a compromise of big vs small, is also a pretty big clue.

comeon, read my comment thoroughly...  It's only based on the congressional apportionment because some people decided to do an EC instead of popular vote.  You are making a post-hoc-ergo-propter-hoc fallacy here.  The apportionment was a compromise to make EC more palatable and fix it's flaws, it was not the defining feature of EC.

> Having a limit to senators/representatives does nothing to change the trends in a popular vote scenario, only the EC scenario.

It does nothing to change a **National** popular vote scenario, which is why I want a national popular vote.  That's kind of a big part of my argument.  I feel like you are skimming my replies without reading actively.

> Seems fairly narrow-scoped to me.

> What laws have been passed that disproportionately affect city people?

Tax Laws, government shutdowns, bailing out farmers due to the republican tariffs (farmers are getting more than they lost, and guess who's paying...), Social services funds come from cities and pay rural areas, fossil fuel extraction, alternative energy funding, water laws, Public transit gutting, public land privatization, I could go on for days.  There are thousands of issues where urbanites and rural hicks are opposed and the republicans always side with the rural folk.

Remember, rural areas take more tax money than they generate.  And yet rural people go out of their way to cancel funds for projects that help cities while demanding more investment in their own areas.  You have to think at the second order impacts to really understand the disparity.

> It says it will put its Electoral Votes towards the candidate that wins the popular vote, not do away with the Electoral College.

That's a distinction without a difference in practice, and you know that.  There is no functional difference between a national popular vote, and awarding a majority of electors to the winner of the national popular vote.

> So by superseding the vote that takes place within the state. That hardly is fair to rural areas.

How is that any different than today's system?  Burns already gets overruled by Portland.  And a rural state would only get overruled if their electors were going to be overruled anyway.

No?  The population of the United states doesn't change if you are in NYC or Antelope.

> The issue that the EC is aiming to resolve is that

**NO**  The electoral college was implemented to solve the issue of a popularly elected president being too close to a king.  And that worried the founders.  Thus they (well half anyway) wanted to separate the president from the popular vote.  So they made electors.  They also didn't want low-information voters choosing a president so they wanted to send people to debate rather than let uninformed people choose.

Having electors has nothing to do with small states vs. large states.  The number of electors takes that into account because small states didn't want to be drowned out in the DEBATE at the CONVENTION.  

But now, we have a pseudo-popular vote, so the electors are not filling their purpose.  The electors don't debate at the convention, so small states don't get drowned out.

> This means that eventually every direct vote election will end up with the urban mindset winning

**NO**

1. The population of the United States will never become infinite.  
2. There is a minimum number of senators (2), a minimum number of congressmen (1), and a maximum number of total congressmen.  THUS each year city voters have less and less say while rural voters have more and more say.  

> creating a tyranny of the majority

**NO** Won't happen, because the rural states still have the senate.  And the senate is the body that votes to confirm the cabinet and SCOTUS, as well as being half of the legislature.

>  In a majority Christian country, we can't create a law that says your tax rate will be inversely related to your amount of pork consumption because that would disproportionately affect Muslim and Jewish populations, and religion is protected.

Funny you should mention this.  Because of the Republican/Trump SCOTUS judges, this can TOTALLY happen now.  Trump v. Hawaii decided that as long as there is a facially legitimate purpose behind a law, it doesn't infringe religious rights, even if they admitted on tape that it was designed with religiously discriminatory purpose.

> If someone's platform was basically ""Screw those country bumpkins over to make urban life better!"" there would be no recourse for the rural population should that person win and follow through with that promise.

The current government though is running on ""screw the city folk"".  So you are throwing the majority of the population under the bus because you decided that rural people are more valuable.

Given the authority of the* legislative *branches over* redistricting, we hold that *the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the asserted* legislative *interest.*

In other words:  We found some old books that said facially, and that sounds lawyerly enough that you probably won't realize we are ignoring evidence and giving you the middle finger."
Portland,"What a lot of people are missing though, is that the president is a check/balance to the house and senate.  And thus should be chosen differently.  The president represents the *whole* country, and by tying the president to congress+senate, you are only reinforcing the power of people currently in power in those areas, and marginalizing those who currently lack political power in the house and senate.  

The President appoints and the senate confirms.  Thus you don't want them representing the same sub-groups of people.  You want them to represent different blocks so that choices that affect the whole country are general compromises.  Just look at the scotus.  A majority of Americans are unhappy with the choices, but because Republicans control rural states, they have outsized influence in BOTH the senate and Presidency.  Thus, they were able to appoint candidates to the SCOTUS without compromise, AND with a minority of the country's support.  Electing the President differently would insure a compromise pick rather than a partisan one.

The EC was intended to be a debate amongst electors at the convention who were chosen for their ability to get information that normal people wouldn't, and choose someone to act as a legislative check to the house and senate.  However, the EC today is not a debate (elector's votes are tied to the poll results), the convention is more a formality than an actually useful event, the people themselves aren't doing the research that the electors were supposed to do for them, Electors are only chosen because of their ability to vote for the winning candidate, and the president chosen is not a check on the power distribution of the senate and house.  So the electoral college is a complete failure for what it set out to do.

> it makes sense to have the state popular vote determine the 2 ""Senator"" votes, and then the popular vote within each district determines their ""Representative"" vote.

Okay, issues:

* Like you pointed out, this is ripe for gerrymandering.  And unlike you, I don't think there is hope for ever moving away from FPTP.  Nor do I think voting methods would change gerrymandering, since that is done by moving boundaries of like-minded individuals through cracking and packing.
* Community level already has representation in the house.  The president is about county-wide agreement.  Farmers in Oregon share some legislative needs with farmers in Missouri, but both groups can be marginalized by district lines in their states.  Popular vote lets those farmers vote as a block.
* Something like 40% of LA voted for Trump, but 0% of their votes helped Trump.  Conversely, loads of people in rural Tennessee vote for the Democratic candidate, but 0% of their votes help democrats.  These are wasted votes.  Popular voting makes LA's 40% Republican actually matter in national politics.  
* Congress has a capped number of seats **AND** a minimum.  This means that no matter how you divide it up, some votes count more than others in the president and house.  Montana, Texas, and California are underrepresented on a per-capita basis.  I think it's Delaware and wyoming that are most overrepresented on a per-capita view.  By tying presidential votes to the number of house seats, you are compounding the inequity introduced by the capped number of house seats.  California's 40 million residents are all under-represented.  And because rural places are overrepresented, that gives rural people oversized representation in the SENATE, HOUSE, **AND** PRESIDENT.  The original idea was to give them just the Senate, instead they have all three.
* Modern life isn't as tied to a physical location as it used to be.  I can work remote from Portland with people in SF, Boston, and Miami.  People can make daily trips across the country for meetings.  People have vacation cabins in different states.  Popular vote makes more sense to represent the highly mobile population we have today.

Making the president a popular vote would fix those issues and can be done without amending the constitution (via this interstate compact).  The electoral college has failed to prevent all the things it was designed to, and is actively making things worse.  It's time to re-evaluate our government like the founders expected.

------------

My ideal would be:

* President as popular vote.
* Better voting system.  I prefer something like the Schulze method personally.
* Make the house back to 30k people per rep.  Harder to gerrymander smaller districts, Harder to bribe larger number of reps, harder to make votes come down to 1 or 2 people with more people."

[...] Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a ""blood libel"" to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.

Nevada,"> hey lets fuck Nevada

It doesn't.  It only comes into effect when enough states pass the bill that makeup a majority of the electors.

Nevada,"> The system was never designed to be a popular vote.

But that's what we have now.  People are voting for a president directly.  The only problem is that some people's vote counts more than others.

> tyranny starts when a small collection of populated states control the entire political discussion

Which is what currently happens.

> The electrical college was never about the popular vote.

The electoral college was designed to prevent people from voting for a specific candidate.  They wanted to prevent a king.  But since all states decide their electors by the results of a vote, and since electors are regularly outlawed from voting differently than the results of that vote, we already have a popular vote.

The problem is that some people have more say than you do.

> There are more smaller states than larger ones.

1. They get their representation in the Senate.  That's the point of having 3 parts of the legislature.
2. The votes of the people in the small states count just as much as in the large ones.

> Why are you comfortable going from dozens of swing states to three permanent states to focus on?

This makes no sense.  Absolutely none.  States don't matter in a national popular vote.  Someone in elko has the same power as someone in nyc.  

If you're pretending that candidates will only campaign in dense areas, how is that different from today?  Moving to a national popular vote actually GIVES power to individuals outside of cities, since their vote actually counts for once.  Republicans in Portland OR will finally be counted.  Democrats in Alabama will finally be counted.  50 votes in Florida won't decide an election.

If anything, moving to a national popular vote would incentivise candidates to campaign in places that they currently don't, since the voters in those places actually count toward their total.

> That's not how our government was drafted

The electoral college was designed to do the following:

1. Make sure only qualified people would be selecting the president.  With the hope that they would debate and decide on a president based on content and not image.  
2. Prevent the president from having a popular mandate.  Because giving them one would be analogous to the power of a king.  The founders wanted a government with checks and balance, and many were worried that a popularly elected president would give them the power to act above the rest of the legislature.

We only got to the point of giving smaller states slightly more electors BECAUSE we didn't do a popular vote.  And both of the reasons for not doing a popular vote are already happening today.  *AND* The unfairness of the electors between states got much worse when they capped the number of congressional representatives while maintaining a minimum. The founders never intended for that to happen, but here we are...

TL;DR - The reasons the founders didn't want a popular vote were to prevent things that are already happening with the electoral college today.  And due to changes in the past century, the electoral college is more unfair than it was ever intended to be.  Removing it would give people more power and provide a better balance in the legislature."

* A road along this 2 miles with some nasty barbed wire:  $8 Million / 10 years (we need a nice road and jobs program)
* 5 Super scary looking trucks with 5 year service contracts:  $1 Million / 5 years
* Solar Panels and flood lights so these terrorists can't hide in the dark:  $2 Million / 10 years (gotta support US industries)
* 16 mall ninjas or preppers paid $100k/year to guard 2 miles of our country: $1.6 Million/year (2 ninjas per mile on an 8 hour shift + 4 extras to cover vacations)
* HR overhead, training, throwing stars, and benefits for desert mall ninjas: $1 Million/year


**TOTAL** - ($12 Million / 10 years) + ($4.6 Million / year) = $5.8 Million / Year

Let's assume that with a 3% withdrawal rate, and investment can last indefinitely.  SO, $5,800,000 / 0.03 = ~$194 Million

What about cameras?

The nest outdoor camera has a 130 degree fov and costs $350.  So with a 20% overlap on each side, a single camera can cover 40 linear feet of the border from a 30 foot camera distance.  It backs up online five days at a time for $5/month, and has built in motion detection!  1.7 miles therefore needs 225 cameras.  Assuming that they will be stolen or broken within 3 years, and need the online backup, that's a yearly cost of $40,000.

Lets assume the cameras need a massive data center internet connection and it costs $100k/month was out there on the border.  Lets also assume that we will pipe the video to a call-center type place in the inner city where one person can watch 75 cameras (motion detection alerts make this easy).  So 3 people per 8 hour shift + extras to cover means 12 employees.  These jobs are cheap at ~40k/year.  Office front desk staffed $40k/year, HR rep $40k/year, and Manager $80k/year.  Plus these people need an office and lets estimate that at $100k/year.  50% overhead for taxes and benefits means Total $1,060,000/year

On the border, we need to build a road.  This doesn't have to be fancy, so let's just chain the ground and run a grader over it.  $100k for 2 miles.  

The border then needs to be staffed.  2 guards on at a time, covering 1 mile of road so that they can respond to a call fast.  $60k/year + 50% = $90k/patrol.  2/mile/8-hour shift + 4 extras = 16 patrolers.  Add a manager and another HR rep = $1,260,000/year

Each team will need a car, so lets give them a ford raptor.  With a service contract, lets just guess $100k with a lifespan of 4 years.  So $25k * 8 teams = $200k/year.

Each team needs a base of operation.  Lets just do a prefab office type setup for each team with solar panels and battery at $150k.  lets be careful and set a lifespan of 10 years for 2 buildings and get $30k/year.

Each camera needs to be wired with power and internet, and lets just guess at $100k for wire and materials with a 5 year lifespan, and lets put all the cameras on posts that cost $1k each with a 5 year lifespan for some reason.  $40k/year. 

Lastly, when we catch these people, lets pay someone to drive them to ICE.  No idea the cost, so lets say it's a $500k/year contract with a prison transport company.

* Cost of cameras and online backup: $40,000/year
* Cost of internet connection for these cameras: $1,200,000/year
* Monitoring center: $1,060,000/year
* Road: $100,000/year
* Patrol: $1,260,000/year
* Trucks: $200,000/year
* Operation base: $30,000/year
* Electrics and poles for cameras: $40,000/year
* Transport: $500,000/year

**TOTAL** - $4,430,000/year for 1.7 miles.  @3% we need $148 Million investment.  Still saved over a billion dollars."

She just excused her dragon's behavior throughout the past few seasons as just a consequence of their existence.  She has been fighting wars and burning people to death for several seasons.  

She has many, many points where the only things that go wrong are because she was too nice.  Like in mereen and all the battles with Tyrion's advice.  Every time she has won was because she didn't hold back (Astapor, meereen, dothraki, loot train).  And then for all her troubles, she gets no love in the west and only suspicion, which puts her on edge regarding her claim to the throne.  Finally she is betrayed by Jon, Varys, and Tyrion, and has her worries about Sansa confirmed, coupled with another death caused by her lack of immediate brutality.

Her burning the city after hearing the surrender bells would really be just a point of ""Being nice hasn't worked ever, so if I just waltz in I haven't resolved any of the problems, haven't gotten any of the revenge I need, and won't sit on the throne for long.

The better writing would have been?  Did you want the main character of the show to have a 1v1 with the big bad and after taking some licks come out victorious before taking the throne?

> I don't give a fuck about subverted expectations

Neither do I.  I just want an interesting story that entertains me.  Learning that it took 7 seasons to groom a character to kill the NK, and collect a team to get her to the NK is entertaining.  Arya really hasn't been connected to the rest of the show in a meaningful way, and tying everything in was pretty cool in my book.

I disagree.  NK wouldn't have shown up without bran.  Bran wouldn't have lived without the armies and dragon glass from Jon.  Arya would only have gotten to that place with Jon, the Hound, and Beric.

Arya couldn't fight the AoTD by herself."
freefolk,"> the writers dismissed the core conflict in 1 episode

They spent 7 seasons preparing for the NK.  Arya was getting trained all over the world, Armies were getting amassed by Danny, Jon was preparing the night's watch, collecting the Northern houses, and getting dragon glass, Sam was learning how to fight the dead, and Bran was becoming the TER and setting events in motion to defeat the NK.

They decide to make their stand against the NK at winterfell.  And thanks to the combination of everything from the past 7 seasons, they defeat the NK.  And you call that dismissed?!  Battles aren't best 2 of 3, you either win or you don't win.  And with the numbers and speed of the dead, it didn't really need to take more than one night..."

Poor people don't pay *income* taxes because they don't have enough income to pay *income* taxes.

I added a second point stating that I am upset at billionaires because they don't pay their fair share.  I (being middle class) pay a higher percentage of my income to *income* taxes than many millionaires and billionaires.  This was intended to help address why people are ""outraged"".

Does that help you understand?"
politics,"Of course poor people don't pay a lot of *income* taxes.  They don't make enough money to pay those *income* taxes.

Wealth inequality is insane in this country, and this 50%-3% thing is just the inevitable consequence of the rich hoarding wealth while not paying their fair share.

You are looking at dollar value when you should be looking at the tax *rate*.  And given that they pay a lower effective tax rate than I do, of course I am outraged.  It pisses me off that people are being paid tens of millions a year while their full time employees struggle to afford rent.  

And the biggest slap in the face is that the income of the super rich has 0 relation to the ""work"" those people do.  They use some of their money to pay someone else to invest their money in someone else's company where a different person spends half their life working to be able to barely afford rent.  Large parts of the top 0.1% could vanish overnight, and absolutely nothing would change in terms of productivity of this country.  Their only contribution to the system is to reduce efficiency.  They are valueless, making money by doing nothing while simultaneously benefiting from everything in this country.

Why do republicans understand the savings of a ""factory direct"" store cutting out the middle man, but somehow believe that a few rich people standing between their vast bank account and their investors is the most efficient solution?  Cut out the middleman.  Pay the lower and middle class what they are worth, and they can spread the money directly to the companies they want."

Pride is a ""I'm proud of who I am, and you can't change that"" event rather than a ""Being gay is something I am proud of"" thing.  So it's not being proud of something that you can't control, it's being proud enough of who you are that you can reject the social pressure from people who don't accept you.  Pride is a reactionary movement, and you can't really take it out of that context.

The phrase ""I'm proud to be gay"" is not said in a vacuum.  It's said in the context of a world where people think that this unchangeable part of you is sinful, dangerous, degenerate, and morally wrong.  And with that context, it should be understood as ""I am proud of who I am, and that is a Gay person.""

You are blaming the wrong people.

> Under the law, the EPA had authority to do only minor work to abate environmental impacts of the mine.

So the EPA was unable to properly clean up the mine prior to it becoming a major issue.  They couldn't get the funds and cleanup ability because the town didn't want to be declared a superfund site.  

> Operating mines have been required to perform such measurement of water level since a fatal mine flood in 1895.

So the mine operated for 28 years without the legally required ability to measure the water buildup.  And then they abandoned it, leaving the EPA to guess at the amount of water in the mine.  

Just because Fox news blames the EPA doesn't mean the EPA is the bad guy.  The real problem was lack of government regulation and resource extraction companies pushing all their costs on the public.  But that goes against the republican narrative, so they don't tell you that.

What most people don't know is that many of the rivers feeding into the Animas are dead because of acid mine drainage from all the mines nearby.  The people who improperly ran the mines took the money and disappeared leaving the government to clean up the mess.  And their intellectual descendants  are now arguing that the people cleaning up the mess are the bad guys, and regulation is the real problem.

> you cannot just blindly treat all traffic the same when network capacity begins to reach a max.

If you can't offer a transmission speed on your network, then you shouldn't be selling that speed.  Why should I allow comcast to derate some services so that they can continue to claim speeds that they cannot support?

> Some traffic is sensitive to [...]

You want a specific QoS?  Then build a network that supports that, and sell a service on that network.  That's what phone lines do.  In the meantime, there are basic design choices (like UDP vs TCP) that address this fundamental part of the internet.  This is not a new problem, don't treat it like it is.

> If you have a network segment operating at near full capacity you have to start managing and prioritizing traffic somehow otherwise all the traffic will begin failing

Then the application is using the wrong protocol, or the network cannot support the speed that they sold their customers.  

Why should I let comcast charge netflix to access me AND let comcast charge me to access netflix just because they want to be able to advertise speeds that they cannot support?
