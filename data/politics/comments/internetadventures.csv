learnfrench,"My pleasure. The way I work the system is to alternate 1-hour sessions in between two tutors. That way I receive intensive learning without burning out on one tutor.

If you're not already there, my advice is to get up to about a B1/B2 level via grammar books like Alter Ego. Then just read and discuss your way up to C1.

Edit: as a final note, I also learned French for my partner. It was defintiely worth the effort, so don't lose faith. Also, assuming you're a native English speaker, take some time to concentrate on accent reduction."

HPfanfiction,"...that really doesn't address any of the points that I raised?

Have you never read a story where characters weren't always telling the truth?"
HPfanfiction,"I'm actually completely aware of what canon says. But we only have Lupin's word on it. He could be lying, because it makes for an easier story than ""I'm the rightful ruler of werewolves, but I don't want the throne.""

Him being a hereditary werewolf explains (a) his name, (b) why he never took in Harry,  (c) why he's the only werewolf we know of to have ever attended Hogwarts, and (d) why Dumbledore was willing to take so many risks on him.

Characters don't always tell the truth about themselves. Sometimes they're deluded, sometimes they're actively hiding something, and sometimes the author just doesn't want to introduce disparate elements to the plot. Dumbledore, Snape, Lockhart, Crouch-Moody, and Slughorn are good examples of such characters in the series.

Also, maybe Fenrir did bite him, but bit him in the sense ""it was Fenrir who gave me this scar,"" rather than ""it was Fenrir who turned me into a werewolf."""

ESL_Teachers,"A quick note on the activities that I use with a full classroom:

""Stations"" divides the reading into paragraphs/sections. These sections are then posted around the room. Groups of students rotate around the room, answering a set of questions as they go.  


""Running Dictation"" is when you delete key phrases from the reading. In pairs, one student writes and one student runs. Posted outside of the room are several copies of the full reading activity. The runner finds the deleted phrase, reports it to the writer who listens and writes the phrase before telling the runner which phrase to find next.  


""On Your Feet"" targets specific words in a text. The class is divided three/four ways. Each group is given a key word from the text. As the teacher reads out loud, students stand up when they hear their key word. You can give out points for the best/quickest/politest standers/sitters. This activity is great for kids and juniors, and I usually follow it with a more traditional read/answer questions from the book."

chess,"One thing I did was to evaluate a position and determine my future plans *after* the tactic. (A) This stops you from playing a tactic that ends with your opponent mating you or gaining back the material, but more importantly (b) it forces you to visualize and develop consolidation skills. 

I created sets of low-rated problems on chesstempo and slowly worked my way up. Since I was training the post-tactic evaluation rather than the tactic itself, I wanted stuff that I would get right 99% of the time."

AskTrumpSupporters,"Hey there, thanks for this reply. 

I'd like to entertain a fourth option: The House was worried that the conservative Supreme Court would rule against Congress's power to enforce its own subpoenas, which would be detrimental to future Congresses.

ColumbusGA,...you are soliciting advice on a public forum to get help endangering someone's job? Good luck with that.
chess,"The CT interface is a lot simpler, and there's no ""consumer flow"" for lack of a better term. While yes you will have to input your repertoire every time you want to learn something new, on Chessable you will have to buy a new repertoire every time you want to change / expand your openings.

Lichess has an opening explorer. I used the Averbakh Grandmaster Series to build a skeleton of my repertoire and then the opening explorer to fill in gaps or go deeper. Then I exported the pgn and uploaded it to CT. In building the repertoire myself, I was forced to explore each line and essentially teach myself as I went. This made understanding and then memorizing lines much easier later on. While there was some extra work invested, it also reduced learning time."
chess,"For CT, just in so much as I find it the best bang for your buck. Also ""kinda worth it"" and ""good"" are rather mitigated recommendations, whereas I am very on-the-horse for CT.

The books on c24 don't have the pgns available either, and you can't copy and paste. I understand what you mean in terms of passive learning, but that marks a difference in our learning objectives. In my opening repertoire, I went first for understanding and then later memorization. Sometimes you really have to know *the* move in the position (Budapest, 2K CK come to mind)."
chess,"As is mentioned every time this topic is brought up, the FAQ doesn't readily display on mobile. The FAQ warning message before posting doesn't, either. Finally, the FAQ cannot be commented on."
chess,"I have to heavily disagree with the comment on Chess24. The videos are nearly useless. Unless you are brilliant and able to learn lines just from watching them, you'll need to export the opening lines into something like Chessable or ChessTempo for practice/memorization. That would be great, except for the fact that you can't extract pgns from their videos. You would need to go over each move one by one, pausing the video each time. Nightmare. In addition, if you pause to analyze a position on the board, the board will not reset when you start playing again. It just maintains your analyzed position.

I also have to disagree with the comment on ChessTempo. ChessTempo Gold opens the opening trainer, endgame trainer, as well as tactics sets to users. The opening trainer is effectively a better Chessable for less of a price. The endgame trainer is the only one of its kind in chess services. And the tactics sets will allow you to train at/for a specific level or for a specific motif. I train drastically below my level on a regular basis when I don't have the energy for difficult tactics but still want to get in some training. I'm also training easy tactics now as I make the push for 2000 bullet. And when I look at my missed problems and notice that I often miss tactics based on a certain motif, I can target that motif for a day before going back to regular training. No other site can offer that.

In terms of books, I do agree that some of my best learning has come from books. I think there are certain books that every new player ""must"" read/go through. Irving Chernev's ""Logical Chess"" is at the top of that list for me.

We are all different players and have different learning styles. For me, my breakthrough - if you can call it that - came from just being exposed to more and more chess and working through the material a day at a time. I can only give you advice from my experiences and what has seemed best to my eyes. Best of luck!"

Anki,"In the end, it‚Äôs really the same thing. I‚Äôm on the legal side, not medical like you, but if you treat terms/acronyms as vocab and create meaningful sentences with the definition buried in them, you‚Äôll have better cards. 

E.g. ""The patient came in two weeks after suffering from severe {{c1:: fasciculation}} in the vastes lateralis. Turns out he had just sat too long in his chair and overreacted to an (albeit persistent) case of {{c2:: obdormition}}.""

I just made all that up, so dress it as you like it, but in those sentences you have the context you need to understand the medical terms."
Anki,"From the question, it looks like vocab acquisition. Apologies if I was mistaken."
Anki,Neither. Find a sentence with the word and cloze the target language.
Anki,"As another commenter suggested, 60 new cards a day is totally realistic. If you review while walking around/commuting, it'll go by easily and quickly. You could probably do more.

Not immediately relevant, but you seem like a Moroccan/Algerian/Tunisian bacc student?"
Anki,Except that translation is a terrible way to learn a new language. You need a full sentence and then cloze your target vocab.

Berserk,"Anti-hero would be a bad guy doing good things. Griffin is, in a way, an anti-hero.

Guts is a classic reluctant hero in the same vein as lots of classic literature. Ulysses. Harry Potter. Every Western ever.

There may or may not be a prophecy, and eventually something that I do is going to determine the fate of the world.""

Don't get me wrong. Just because it's been done before doesn't make Guts's story a great one."

ELATeachers,"This is *exactly* where teachers and admin go wrong. They see studies that say reading and writing increase interest for their students so they add in a random writing activity that doesn't relate to the lesson rather than create a writing activity that satisfies the ""produce"" part of their lesson and reinforces whatever was taught that day.

Imagine you're in a hospital and you're going to get surgery. Now nutrition principles dictate that you should drink 4 glasses of water a day\*. However, today you're getting surgery, and surgery principles dictate that you can't eat or drink 12 hours before surgery. What to do? You could (1) start drinking water at 8 am and endanger your surgery, (2) drink no water and endanger your nutrition, or (3) hydrate after your surgery.

The choice is clear.

Similarly, in OP's hypothetical lesson plan of (1) book talk, (2) reading, (3) writing, and (4) mini-lesson and creation, the purported benefits of reading and writing are being put above the needs of the lesson. It's completely cart-before-the-horse. It's water-before-surgery.

Much better is to say ""Today I need to teach my students X. Here's an article on X, here's a video on X, and then again I could just lecture about X and get the point across quickly.""

Scenario (1): ""The article has interesting material that's relevant to the lesson. Let's go with the article to present the material, this worksheet to practice it, a group discussion about super-interesting-topic Y, and an in-class writing activity that answers topic Y.""

Scenario (2): ""We've done an article recently and I haven't built up my class's ability to read long segments, so let's go with the video.  We'll do a jeopardy-style quiz in groups about the info on it, then students can check their answers with this sheet I've created. That's a lot of group time, so let's go straight to the writing activity at the end.""

Scenario (3): ""Wow I have some great practice exercises and some great speaking/writing activities for X. Let's get all the info on the board at the beginning of class and move straight to activities.""

Now you'll notice in each scenario reading and writing *is* happening. *But it's happening for a purpose.* The purpose of a writing or reading activity should never be the activity itself.  The point of the reading and writing is to *reinforce* or *present* whatever is being taught. It should be in line with your objectives, and it should move the lesson forward.

If you're just throwing activities at your students, you're not a teacher -- anyone can point at a book and say ""read."""

grammar,"""All right"" and ""alright"" are both taught in the ESL classroom. I'd always assumed they were both acceptable forms."
grammar,"No, it's really just extremely informal, one of those things that are said but not written and even then with the understanding that what is said is wrong.

It's like when people say ""You done f----- up."" There's an immediate understanding between native speakers that it's not a correct phase.

Of course there's always the chance that there's some niche place in the anglophone world that says that. Do people say thus where you're from?"
grammar,"I have no idea what u/tweedlebeetle and u/patternboy are talking about. Full is an adjective only, not a past participle ( fill - filled - filled ). You can't use the phrasal verb ""Fill up"" with the adjective ""full.""

ArenaHS,"Sonya combos well with some of the most common cards in the meta. Getting a second giggling, mossy, bonemare, or fungle will be a far more reliable tempo win than the stat stick that is Gruul.  


Gruul vs Sonya boils down to who controls the win condition. If you throw down Gruul and your opponent has an answer, you've just given him/her the board.  


However, with Sonya you can keep it in hand until you have a high-tempo play.  


Clearly Sonya is the better pick."
ArenaHS,"Jaraxxus. Picking Jaraxxus (especially on the 1st pick) will completely change your draft style. Essentially you're just going to need to pick enough early game to make certain you survive / have the board when Jaraxxus is played.

I wasn‚Äôt thinking of it like that, great point. 
"
Feminism,"Honestly I‚Äôve never seen them here. The first time I ever even heard of pepper spray in Morocco was this morning, in fact, which is why it was on my brain. 

As much as I‚Äôd like some men to get what‚Äôs coming to them, I don‚Äôt feel like escalation of force is a good answer to the problem. Not doing something because you‚Äôre scared of the consequences (getting a mouthful of peppery justice, for example) is different from changing the mindset of the people, even if they have similar effects. 

Maybe you do it anyways, though, since safety is more important than doing things on the high road. Definitely something to consider. "
Feminism,"It depends on what you mean by ""arm."" Pepper spray and tazers are available and used in Europe. I‚Äôve also seen them in Turkey and Cambodia, but that‚Äôs the extent of my lived experience. 

If you‚Äôre talking about concealed carry, then yes, I‚Äôd say the US is the only place where that would be accepted. "
Feminism,"I believe it would be tried like any assault / self-defense case. 

If the harassment had strayed toward assault, you‚Äôd definitely be in the clear. But if it‚Äôs ""just"" (not sure how to convey the correct feeling there, sorry) unwanted attention, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have the legal grounds for it and would probably be arrested/fined for assault. 

In talking about this hypothetical, I really hope everyone reading this will realize Morocco isn‚Äôt some sharia law backwater. People aren‚Äôt stoned to death. With the exception of marriage, religion rarely enters the legal system. Jurisprudence in Morocco is in itself essentially a copy-paste of France‚Äôs. "
Feminism,"üò¨ Where I live in Casablanca, the people would probably be on your side. Even the men around would give you a couple of claps. 

The law, on the other hand...

There‚Äôs a certain acceptance in Moroccan society that on one level harassment is a bad thing but also a non-issue / harmless. Like eating chocolate is a bad thing, but you‚Äôre not going to go to diabetic prison for having a midnight cocoa. "
Feminism,"üòÇüòÇ Actually, yes! If pepper spray were more widely available here, I think it would change the dynamic a bit."
Feminism,"The campaigns I have in mind are ones that encourage women to speak back to men, since that attempts to answer the source social cause of men receiving a ""thanks but no thanks.""

My comment was colored by my real-life experience.

Even if you‚Äôre trying to say that I should have mentioned men fighting for these same issues, you‚Äôd have to convince most Moroccan men that harassment is a legitimate issue in the first place. 

Ignoring that, you‚Äôd still want both men and women to be fighting against it, and yet again that can be incredibly taxing for women. Thanks for pointing out my lack of mentioning of the man‚Äôs role in fighting street harassment, but I stand by what I said. 

Every time I comment, you‚Äôre searching for something to disagree with and then immediately downvote it. I‚Äôd like to say thanks for the productive chat. You‚Äôve given me a lot to think about, and I definitely have a better feel for the r/Feminism community now. 

"
Feminism,"I‚Äôm sorry, what? What part of me being a subscriber to r/feminism openly discussing harassment and its social effects led you to assume I act as a bystander when I see women harassed?"
Feminism,"I‚Äôm with you 100%. Obviously there‚Äôs some profound ignorance on men‚Äôs parts that they lack the self-awareness to figure out why women respond the way that they do. 

Again, I‚Äôm talking about how men‚Äôs perception is formed. Not the objective truth of the situation. 

We also have similar movements here, but many of my women friends find that fighting against harassment takes too much energy and causes too much stress. 

Now in addition to having to fight for equal rights, treatment, and pay in the workplace, women also have to respond strongly and negatively to men who approach them in the street?

It‚Äôs the right thing to do, but it‚Äôs also incredibly taxing. 

On a grand social scale, it has to be done. But most people just want to get to work on time. "
Feminism,"Suuuuper complicated topic. I‚Äôm an American man living in Morocco, and I‚Äôm currently publishing an article citing this exact study. 

As far as men‚Äôs perception is concerned, women here DO like getting harassed. Please stick with me here. 

A woman gets harassed by a man. Maybe the guy is a normal human being, but maybe he‚Äôs also hyper-aggressive or crazy. Now if you tell the guy ""Thanks but no thanks"" and go on your way, nothing bad ever happens to you. 

Now if you tell the normal guy to fuck off, everything‚Äôs fine. But if you tell the aggressive or crazy guy to fuck off, you possibly have a huge problem. 

It‚Äôs natural, then, that women use ""thanks but no thanks"" as a defense mechanism. It‚Äôs the only scenario in which everything turns out okay. 

As a man, if at best you get a number, at worst you get ignored, and as a norm you get ""thanks but no thanks,"" it‚Äôs totally natural to think that 1) harassment isn‚Äôt a problem and that 2) some women like harassment. 

Obviously I‚Äôm not justifying harassment, but I hope that clears up how many men‚Äôs perception of harassment is formed. 

Edit: aaaaaand I was downvoted anyways."

There's definitely an argument to be made that the Breeder didn't actually kill them. Maybe he, like the first Breeder we met, wants out, and the only way from him to see that done is to see Jahad killed and survive the vengeance of whoever killed him.

Fake-killing Bam's companions seems to be a good step in that direction.

That said, I'm not too caught up about the character deaths. I think Killing them off would be good from a writer's standpoint to cut out some excess that's developed and move the story along. At the same time, I could definitely see them surviving for the same purpose.

Developing for other purposes, e.g. while misplacing your opponents pieces (Catalan with Bb5+), while limiting your opponent‚Äôs options (QG structures where Black plays Bg4), or for a certain structure (developing with future plans to liberate the f-pawn) are skills that can be acquired once players have learned the objectives of basic system openings and understand why they‚Äôre lacking.

chess,"I wish I did.

chess,"Yeah, I definitely did. Doing this on mobile Christmas morning and got lost in my headspace along the way. Thanks for looking it over. "
chess,"I‚Äôm certain this seems strange saying ‚Äúthey want to prepare their f-pawns to move.‚Äù How do they know they want to move the f-pawns? How do they know to move the knights to those squares? Why no other square to evacuate the knight, or prepare it via another series of moves?

Let‚Äôs start with the first question by looking at the position. The closed center means white and black will pursue play on the flanks. There are numerous plans for both black and white, so both sides need to be prepared for breaks on the kingside or breaks on the queenside. So now we‚Äôve determined an f-pawn or b-pawn push is in the future of the position. 

Now, how do they know to move the knights to these particular squares? The best way to answer that question is to ask ‚Äúwhere would these pieces be best-placed?‚Äù 
(1) Black would love his knight on f4, but he‚Äôll need to face down Bxh5 to get it there. No go. Instead, Ne8 followed by the f5 push and then rerouting the knight offers the best chances. 
(2) White knows he needs to be prepared for the f-pawn push. How to respond? One plan is to push his own pawn to either f3 or f4. The first tries to maintain the closed center. The second tries to meet (f)ire with (f)ire. So where to put the knight in order to liberate the f-pawn? Let‚Äôs again ask the question ‚Äúwhere does this piece want to be?‚Äù How can this knight defend against the f5 push, possibly support an f4 push and a king-side attack, AND possibly support a queen-side attack? The answer is to put the knight on d3. So in turn we find the maneuver Ne1, Nd3. 

We‚Äôve already somewhat answered the question ‚Äúwhy evacuate the knight to e8/e1 rather than another square,‚Äù but I think there‚Äôs one last point to make. I‚Äôve seen players in the white position play moves such as h3 to liberate the h2 square for the knight. However, this is weakening, and will give black more targets in the impending kingside attack. When other liberating moves weaken your position, and there are no clear strengthening moves to be made, it‚Äôs time to pursue your main plan of attack. Even though the black knight isn‚Äôt the happiest on e8, it‚Äôs one step backwards for two steps forwards. 

All that said, almost no players figure out the opening over the board. If you‚Äôve never seen the King‚Äôs Indian Defense before, you won‚Äôt know f‚Äî"

chess,"The Lichess training is definitely one way to go. Personally I would recommend going through chess books or games. It's the same thing, but you're connecting those squares to ideas at the same time which will reenforce the learning.

Learning squares is a cart-before-the-horse logical mistake that chess players are often victim to. Spend five hours memorizing squares to play through books faster... or spend five hours studying books and by the time those hours are finished you've acquired the target knowledge you wanted in the first place.

That said, any step you make towards your chess education is a step forward. When you're not feeling up to investing the energy in tactics, playing, or analysis, ""spot the square"" and YouTube videos are definitely a good way to keep your chess journey going."
chess,"The ""Tactics Time"" series were the first chess books I ever bought. I had it on my kindle and would cycle through it, bookmarking any problems I got wrong.

The Polgar sisters' father published a tactics book that scaffolds from simple to advanced tactics. However, its a real tome of tactics and I've never seen a physical copy.

Those are simple ones that I've used and would recommend looking at. The best tactics books I've ever had, however, are Dan Heisman's ""Looking for Trouble"" and Ray Cheng's ""Practical Chess Exercises."" They can both be used by players of all levels, and I still revisit them to this day."

Thanks so much, I‚Äôll check him out. For now I‚Äôm solving, showing the lines I considered, and then looking at frequent mistakes people make. It would be good to see how others are recording tactics. "
chess,"Chess.com is one site trying to do a lot of things. It‚Äôs the jack-of-all trades, master of none of chess sites. Chess24 has better video series, lichess has a better playing experience...

...and chesstempo is the unquestioned king of tactics trainers by miles. No other site even comes close to equaling it. 

I‚Äôm assuming you play on chess.com, so you‚Äôre familiar with the 5 free problems timed set.

Chesstempo, paid or unpaid, has no limitations on their tactics trainer. However, it is more than that. Problems can be commented on and tagged. You can visit each problem individually in order to look again at problems you‚Äôve missed. You can work in timed or untimed modes. Tactics sometimes necessitate a defensive move. You also don‚Äôt need to open a separate window in order to analyze the position. Each position also comes from real master games, which you can go back and look over. There are certain positions I can bring easily to my mind just because I saw my favorite players names beside it. 

And if you pay for the service, you can create custom sets that limit your training to certain areas. You recently couldn‚Äôt figure out how to promote your IQP on the seventh rank? Play through promotion tactics. They‚Äôre too difficult? Limit the set to your own rating level, then gradually work up. Feeling comfortable? Now do it in timed (blitz) mode. The capacity for gains is endless. 

If I haven‚Äôt convinced you, I‚Äôm currently recording a video series of myself doing tactics on chesstempo, going from 1200 all the way up to 2000 with about 20 videos per 100 points. Once I‚Äôve finished the 1600s, I‚Äôll send you a link. "

chess,"Watching any chess video on YouTube would be a good starter. Begin with any John Bartholomew series (/u/IMFins) and the old /u/ChessExplained videos. Chess24 BanterBlitz is also decent, but not quite so good on educational content. Their YT channel names are the same as their names I've given.

I don't think you'll learn too much concrete information from their videos, but it will give you a lot of broad exposure to various chess ideas.

Then head to chesstempo.com (/u/chesstempo) to train tactics. If you have $35 to spare, a year membership on chesstempo is the single best investment you can make in your chess education.

In general, playing against computers is not encouraged. Chess players usually use computers to analyze positions. This is because engines cannot make a fair approximation of what it is like to play against a human opponent. When ""dumbed down,"" they play consecutive perfect moves, and will then randomly play sub-optimal moves or offer you a free piece with no idea behind it.

I've taken some time to help you out here, so I hope you'll take the time to do a subreddit search of topics similar to yours. In the search bar, limit the search to r/chess and try the key words ""improvement,"" ""beginner,"" ""help,"" or ""starting out.""

HPfanfiction,"I think you're making a mistake in assuming that the front door was the only way to get out of the castle that night, and that FF altered Filch's behavior in order to make it that way. 

Maybe FF just makes the best of all possible options? For example, FF ""knows"" that the best end to the night is to get the memory, or uses the drinker's mind to determine the best end of the potion. Then it prompts the drinker to make choices to achieve their goal. 

So if the front door had been closed that night, Harry would instead have had the sudden urge to jump out the window onto the back of a friendly hippogryph who'd just happened to be passing by.

Hence, Voldemort's soul was successfully ruptured, but in the process he lost his body. This would also explain why other children never survived the AK. Though their mothers sacrificed themselves, the attacker wasn't intending to make a Horcrux. 

Another possible theory is that Voldemort's last soul container belonged to Gryffindor, and Gryffindor's lingering presence in it refused to be occupied by dark magic. The artifact was destroyed, and Tom lost his body in the backlash. Without a soul container, the Horcrux went into Harry. "
