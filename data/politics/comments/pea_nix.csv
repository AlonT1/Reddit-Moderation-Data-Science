Maybe experiment and see how it looks with a bigger swordhandle and pistol to give it more weight.  More forearm."
G37,"Good, don't tune until you're sure that you won't be adding or changing anything else.  You car isn't going to be at risk from bolt-ons (unless you are out doing something crazy to push the engine), you just won't have the most power from them until you do."

Spectrum,"What kind of help for this issue are looking to get here?  This subreddit is mainly for hardware and service issues.  You should be talking directly with a lawyer about any case you might have, even if it is hard to get in contact with one.

Try a legal subreddit or a real lawyer."
politics,"Allied in the agenda of putting the country on a better track than it currently is.  Biden may not represent to everyone what the best route of getting people medical coverage may look like, but being in favor of one plan over another doesn't mean he's against people being covered at all; The same could be said of any issue mentioned.  For instance, is a blanket ""free college for all"" the best use of public funds, or would ""free college"" for those from families making under X amount, be better? In Biden, those on the left can know that they have someone willing to listen and consider their issues in balance with the needs of all.  The other option is to cede any chance of a way forward and instead prepare for more great leaps backwards.  If someone sees everyone who does not agree with them completely as an enemy, they will find the world a very small and hostile place.  Biden's platform may not be left enough for some, but at least it's going forward, and that makes for much better allies than the other option."
politics,"I think that is such a privileged position to be able to hold, insulated in California from the troubles of the rest of the nation.  I tell myself the same thing for the opposite reason so often here in KY.  But pushing that supposedly state-centric boycott onto a national stage, with national publication, and further onto a global platform like reddit makes it no longer about your individual vote or the electoral college of your state.  It becomes another divisive, needless wedge against someone who has repeatedly shown a willingness to listen and change for important issues, someone who must balance the demands of the moderates and other facets of the party.  Preemptive hit pieces like this Jacobin article seem to serve only in stoking resentment and putting people who would otherwise be allies into an aggressive stance."
G37,"The 7AT on newer models is decent, can hold bolt-on power, and can be improved with a little tuning.  The 5AT is fine for making the car go...but it's paired with a pretty low final drive and doesn't hold the same power or response as the 7."
Spectrum,You're splitting the speed between all devices in the home.
q50,The automod pulled this for some reason but it's up now.
G37,"Hey thanks, that's what this community is supposed to be for.  I'm happy to share what I know, and what I've picked up working with the VQ platform over the years.  There are just so many people out there selling bunk products, or pushing stuff that isn't really needed, especially in the car world and I hate that."
G37,"Yeah, the spacers not really a ""need"" item on those terms.  It won't hurt anything, the price won't break the bank, and if you can install it yourself all the better.  But I wouldn't bother personally."
G37,"Right, I have the M370 specifically because of that; I would rather have the power in the midband where I use it the most.  The Z1 would be better for say, drag setups, I think.  The oil pan spacer isn't something you'd *really* need on a DD, but it's great as extra ""track insurance"" and avoiding having to tap the stock pan if you have FI."
G37,"Ambient temps can come into play though, you don't have to drive as hard on a hot day to get those temps up; But yes, racing applications is where this most commonly occurs.  I think the M370 is also a great upgrade over stock (Motordyne is a solid company with thorough development) *however* Z1 also has an aftermarket plenum, and the two seem to make power at different points in the band."
G37,"The real ""gain"" being made is the removal of the stock paper filter, which is restrictive.  And, for the most part, you would not see much of a difference power wise, between the two options (Drop-In vs CAI) *unless* you did a lot of hard driving; in which case you might get heat soak with a CAI's metal tubes.  Longtubes could suffer from this same effect, but the additional gains from their design should still put them above either.  But their difference in ability to actually filter particulates for all options is negligible."
G37,"I haven't personally seen any difference in the foam mesh in decades.  Everything breathes better than the nonporous paper filter, and if the aftermarket mesh filters were any bigger or smaller they wouldn't work right.  What you said was to save for a CAI, because ""K&Ns filter out particles worse than regular air filters"" but those CAI intakes use the same filters."
G37,"Imma just repost a comment I've already done;  

>The stock airbox and tubes are just fine and dandy at their job, which is keeping hot air out of the intake and directing air to the engine. Standard stuff. The restrictive point is the stock paper air filter; replacing it with an aftermarket mesh drop-in will net you a little power and slightly better temps.

>Short-Ram intakes also get rid of these stock paper air filters BUT they are open to the hot air of then engine bay and you can easily loose power with them.

>Regular-length ""CAIs"" are basically more expensive replacements for that stock air filter, with the ""bonus"" of adding a shiny metal tube which may be worse at preventing heat soak than the stock tube.

>Now, Longtube intakes obviously, again, get rid of those stock paper filters BUT the added length allows for the airflow to smooth out with the added benefit of being in the direct path of air while driving. You will see better gains with the longtube, but you have to decide for yourself if the money is worth it for you personally as they are the most expensive set-ups.

And here are some helpful videos from Motorvate:

[K&N Filter Dirt Test: G37/370z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvExyfxzsRo)

So to answer your question, they are the cheapest viable *upgrade* for your intake, but not the cheapest *replacement* (another paper filter).  Gains are gains, but you won't likely feel it, although you might hear a slight difference."
G37,K&N Drop-Ins and CAI Filters are literally the same material.  That's not right at all.
Spectrum,"Well, you could call in and see if it's an area outage (automated message) and you won't have to say anything.  If it's not an area outage, you could talk to someone there and see what they can do to help you, if they can.  Or you could say some other details about whats happening and see if someone here can help you."
q50,"pfft, reading.  XD"
G37,"Well the y-pipe is a single piece with integrated flex section...not sure why they are listing it as 3 parts?  You could get a used OEM one for fairly cheap and likely bolt it on there yourself.  Or have someone just close the hole, but it looks like pretty extensive rust buildup."
infiniti,"It's generally recommended to do bushings and endlinks when you do sways, which is often why people wait to do them until the car is a bit older and the rubber is getting closer to being kaput.  (A '12 is perfectly fine.)

If you just want sound over gains, look around at just axle-backs.  If you really want to get the most power then yes, a catback system is what you want *but* be advised that on the VQ, it's going to be your least efficient use of money for power.  Most of the exhaust gains are made by replacing the cats.

Be sure you won't do any more intake/exhaust mods before you tune; don't worry too much if there is a gap between parts and tune-  while you won't get the most gains without it, the stock ECU won't have too much trouble handling bolt-ons (very low risk of det as long as you aren't going at it.)"
infiniti,"Hotchkis have been the best DD sways out there for the VQ platform for like two decades almost.  The strut on the other hand, you probably won't notice ever, unless you're pushing it *hard*.  I have seen similar lights available for the Sedan but I don't have a link to any particular one. 

ARK/Motordyne>Stillen; not that anything is *wrong* with Stillen, but if you want absolutely top quality and gains, ARK & MD are the $$$$ options.  

I've heard that more people are going for ECUTek over UpRev these days, has something to do with support and available options.  You can tune a stock car and get gains, and if you're modded you really should get one."
Spectrum,Can't happen soon enough.
q50,"So for VQs, here's the skinny:  The stock airbox and tubes are just fine and dandy at their job, which is keeping hot air out of the intake and directing air to the engine.  Standard stuff.  The restrictive point is the stock paper air filter; replacing it with an aftermarket mesh drop-in will net you a little power and slightly better temps.

Short-Ram intakes also get rid of these stock paper air filters *BUT* they are open to the hot air of then engine bay and you can easily loose power with them.  

Regular-length ""CAIs"" are basically more expensive replacements for that stock air filter, with the ""bonus"" of adding a shiny metal tube which may be worse at preventing heat soak than the stock tube.  

Now, Longtube intakes obviously, again, get rid of those stock paper filters *BUT* the added length allows for the airflow to smooth out with the added benefit of being in the direct path of air while driving.  You will see better gains with the longtube, but you have to decide for yourself if the money is worth it for you personally as they are the most expensive set-ups."
q50,I like this better.

Louisville,"Most places keep up-pricing without doing any real improvements, all trying to catch the smallest, richest percent of renters; Leading to plenty of vacancies out there making $0 a month right now, instead of just making rent reasonable.

Louisville,"Indeed, the alleged case of bribery is looking pretty damning for Householder & related parties as the FBI apparently had multiple persons on the inside collecting data and recording conversations.

Louisville,">""Lycan served as the general counsel of the Republican Party of Kentucky from 2016 until April 2019 and has served for almost three years as the general counsel of the Republican majority leadership of Kentucky’s House of Representatives.

Louisville,"That has always been the question, ha, however the answer to a few of them is the building still being in possession of their original owners/families.

Spectrum,"You're definitely not getting the full 50 over WiFi, that's just the nature of the beast.  If it's not loading at all, it's likely a different problem altogether though it sounds like you're not really looking to diagnose that.  If you are going to switch up, you should start calling around now and do what you can to set up an appointment because most likely your area's other providers are experiencing the same staffing/scheduling issues as everyone else.

Here is a wiki excerpt if you've never encountered the term ""packet loss:""

>Wireless networks are susceptible to a number of factors that can corrupt or lose packets in transit, such as radio frequency interference (RFI), radio signals that are too weak due to distance or multi-path fading, faulty networking hardware, or faulty network drivers.

>Wi-Fi is inherently unreliable and even when two identical Wi-Fi receivers are placed within close proximity of each other, they do not exhibit similar patterns of packet loss, as one might expect.

>Cellular networks can experience packet loss caused by, ""high bit error rate (BER), unstable channel characteristics, and user mobility."" TCP's intentional throttling behavior prevents wireless networks from performing near their theoretical potential transfer rates because unmodified TCP treats all dropped packets as if they were caused by network congestion, and so may throttle wireless networks even when they aren't actually congested."
Spectrum,"Why don't you try using an ethernet cable to play instead of WiFi?  This is generally the number one issue with gaming & internet together, and the problem is most likely your PS4 not getting a clear signal.  You also mention ""and maybe another phone and roku"" which you dismiss, but that *can* be part of the problem-  you're splitting the connection with other devices which could be hogging all of your bandwidth."
Spectrum,"For as much as the industry complains about piracy, they sure are doing as much as they can to push people into doing just that."
infiniti,"Never heard of it;  Looks like the entry level price is $65,000 + donor car, which gets you 50hp and a body kit.  Hard skip, that's ""just get a 'vette bro"" territory."
G37,"No, worse.  I'm guessing you're looking at an 08?"
G37,"If you are just looking to FI a DD car and not outfit it for racing, there are supercharger setups available at 6k shipped new, and used ones pop up every so often.  Many sites just charge a high premium for the kits they have. If you keep the power low and are okay with the risk, you don't have to build anything.  The 7AT will be the riskiest part of that if it's what you've got, 6MT can hold more power."
G37,"The 7AT can handle full bolt-ons and a tune just fine, you won't be at the 400-450wtq where you're at risk."
q50,"I don't know that I've heard anything was wrong with them?  I don't think they have anything for the 2.0 or 3.0, and they have regular red/yellow for the 3.7 but no lightweight options.  Something you're specifically looking to get/do?"
Spectrum,"Many 3rd party services are slowing download speeds because of high demand.  As an example, gaming platforms are doing this so that they can serve the widest audience at a time, so that no one is completely locked out at any point.  Imagine buying a brand new game and being unable to even download it after paying because the users that got there before you are using up all the server capacity."
Spectrum,"it's possible the dish itself has a fault, i'm not 100% on specs for those and whether an older one would create a DOCSIS issue.  is it older that the 2-3 years it's been moved around?"
Spectrum,"Okay;  and the dish, lines, hardware/signals have all been checked by a tech?  And what about about connecting using an ethernet cable instead of wireless, speeds still the same?"
Spectrum,"Are you saying you don't have any actual hardware in the house, you're connecting to a distant wireless signal on a tower?"
G37,"As said, Supercharging is great if you're looking for instant on-tap power throughout the range, and can be added on to any stock or bolt-on modded car.  If you really want to look at getting more kick without going FI you should look into a set of final drive gears."
G37,The stock cats are what quiet the exhaust most on your current system most likely.  You're already set with the test pipes (flames will kill hfcs anyway) and you might want to see how it sounds with just TP (but before the tune) before making other changes.  Don't tune until you're absolutely certain you won't change the exhaust anymore.
Spectrum,"Sounds like a business lie to CYA.  Intent often plays a role in legal proceedings, so they're claiming they don't want to do the single thing they would need this change for."
G37,"The flames come from extra fuel being dumped into the mix, controlled by the tune.  Manzo is a generic brand, and some of what they have for the G37 is still a likely upgrade over stock."

Spectrum,"""Down"" would mean internet fully out, ""slow"" is what is happening here;  When you are experiencing slow speeds, what are you doing to test them?  And can you verify during those periods that no one else is using your connection?  Outside of that, if you *are* capable of hitting the speeds you're supposed to get- it sounds like the issue is going to be local congestion *or* heavy server load  wherever you're trying to connect to."
Spectrum,"I see, you're just looking to argue.  Find somewhere else to be then."
Spectrum,"It does matter though.  It matters to them that they are frustrated, and again, this subreddit is for that.  What you call ""pointing out the obvious"" (whatever that was) can also be seen as gatekeeping behavior that discourages other users from feeling free to participate in this subrebbit; which *is*, in fact, against the *sitewide* rules of reddit.  You then proceeded to personally insult the user, not offer ""constructive criticism,"" which is more unwelcome behavior. That is why your posts were removed."
Spectrum,"I'm not addressing any of your other posts (?), I'm pointing out that the usage of this forum is in part directly intended for the airing of grievances. Cursing isn't against the rules here, on it's own, provided it's not directed at another user.  I know this isn't an ideal post but I am still able to understand what the user is frustrated about."
Spectrum,"Can you only play via wireless?  For competitive gaming, wired is *always* recommended because of issues like this."
Spectrum,"Users are welcome to bring their grievances.  Ideally, so that they can get help with their issue but sometimes people are frustrated (and thats customers and employees.)"
Spectrum,"Steam, Epic, and I believe others are doing so (especially with all the summer sales) because they're getting overwhelmed.  Lots of people home doing the same."

Spectrum,"It sounds like you are speaking with sales instead of retention, you might try asking for that department.  There is absolutely an internet-only plan if you are done with cable, standard rate in most areas should be $69.99; but I don't think you'll be able to get a introductory rate under that as you aren't ""new"" so there really shouldn't be a bunch of wheeling and dealing on their side."
Spectrum,"Locked, incivility all around.  u/TheAlphaHit, you have some suggestions:  call support, check hardware, or even consider that traffic everywhere might be severely up.  In the future, use the report button and do not engage in personal insults."

Spectrum,"There are many Spectrum employees here, and many of them have been very helpful to the users who post here as customers having issues.  Don't be here if you don't want to be, but please do not disparage everyone else."
Spectrum,"Traffic in the system near you (including other people using your wireless connection,) or the Speed Test is utilizing different  Chicago servers on each test.  Again, the number one easiest thing you could do from your end right now would be to try gaming with a wired connection, and even try a speed test or two with a wired connection.  If that doesn't change things, then it will point you toward a likely culprit."
Spectrum,"Did you read the sticky?

The speed test servers might be busy.  Your local node might be overwhelmed.  You are gaming on your phone, using wireless?  Something might be wrong with your phone or you might simply be getting interference."
Spectrum,"Drops don't have to do with your speed.  Your phone's hardware or the router/modem might be having issues, or you might be somewhere with high interference, or your local node has too much traffic OR hearthstone servers have too much traffic.  Generally, wireless is not considered optimal for gaming."
q50,"Consider finding something a few thousand under your budget so you've got some extra when you need to pick up a new set of tires ($$$$) or something goes wrong.  Also, it would be worth your time *now* to call around about insurance on the model you're looking at because at 18 it's going to be high.  You'll likely find the 3.7 models at better prices, and they're easier to maintain at that.  The VQ engine is a solid choice for longevity."
q50,"Not a Q50 specifically but I'm not sure that I've ever heard of it going right on a VQ car.  The added weight alone kills it for most people looking for performance, and most of the kits out there I've seen aren't from reputable companies-  one of those things it would be best not to cheap out on like a good racing seat.  Then again, I don't know any company that has bothered to do safety testing/crash testing with the lambo doors on."
Spectrum,"Pulled by automod, approved."
G37,"18s will weight less (better mpgs, handling, acceleration) than 19s *and* will be less expensive."
G37,"Was the car previously tuned on UpRev or similar?  Does it still have the cable attached, if so?  If that turns out to be the case, you've got to contact them to pick up a new license for it.  That's just the only thing I've ever heard of that seems similar.

Other than, the ECU isn't just open source as far as I know...  So not just any rando can plug it into a port and do whatever they want.  Are you being asked to pay for this ""shipping overseas"" (and to where exactly?)  I'm just hoping it's not the mechanic taking you for a ride."
q50,"CAI will be a fairly mild sound change (and mild but measurable power even without tune) whereas replacing the stock cats with some HFCs or straits will really bring it up (this is the most restrictive part of the exhaust and will net you the biggest power change, but can also be the biggest power loss in the low end depending on what you go with.)  Getting larger diameter piping past the cats will also net you a little sound and power, but will typically be the least cost effective thing you can do.  You can also buy an aftermarket plenum from Motordyne or Z1 that can make power, but won't do much with sound I think.  Anyhow, save a tune for when you think you won't mod anything else and you'll get the biggest power bump.  And as I have advised many:  cutting your exhuast apart makes it a lot harder to return to stock."
G37,"Yes?*

*Reasonable may vary depending on your area and availability of similar years and models."
Shadowrun,">Remington  Roomsweeper (Heavy Pistol) :  This  is  really  more  of  a  short-barreled  shotgun  than  a  pistol.  When  loaded  with shot  rounds  (flechette)  rather  than  solid  slugs,  it  uses  Heavy Pistol ranges but shotgun rules (Shotguns, p. 180).

So it's a pistol, that functions like a pistol when using slugs, but uses shotgun rules with specific (flechette) ammo.  I think it's really important not to treat flavor text as rules text, that seems to be causing a lot of confusion for people.  Anyhow, from a design/balance perspective this fills the same role as the KS2- it allows someone who uses one type of weapon to dabble in a secondary/specialized attack form without requiring an investment from the player."
Shadowrun,Haven't seen it?  I don't have the book and only glanced the preview.
Shadowrun,"If it's a type of weapon that is the size of another weapon, I think it's still going to be the type of weapon it says it is.  For instance, if the KS2 says it's a shotgun, it seems to be a holdout shotgun for shotgun/non-pistol specialists.  It would still use shells, jump like a shotgun, still have the same close range and spread."

Louisville,"Where did she say she was a ""Trump Democrat?"""
politics,"Charles Booker and many of his supporters have been painting McGrath as ""pro-Trump,"" and I think that is at best a very disingenuous interpretation of her actual statements.  What she has done is highlighted all of Trump's empty promises and (rightly) painted McConnell as his enabler by his failures to allow bills to move forward that Kentuckians care about.  Further, I think that what Booker and his supporters fail to understand is that by calling McGrath ""pro-Trump,"" they only increase McGrath's appeal to on-the-fence conservatives who are tired of McConnell's political BS, and I think they could play a very key role in this election.

More people are going to get sick, absolutely, and all of this and the re-openings will without a doubt accelerate that.

Testing just gives us a better look at the numbers, but the virus isn't going anywhere, it's still spreading."
Spectrum,"A lot of ""problems"" come from people just not understanding how the full system works; i.e. no ISP can force a gaming server to not be over-capacity or institute a user cap, no ISP can keep power transformers from popping on a hot night and taking out the cable line, and so on.  Behind that, user error and lack of base level knowledge of technology is a huge contributing factor; there is a reason simplistic stuff like ""try turning it off and on again"" gets repeated so much.  However, you can blame the company for their toxic in-house culture like overworked tech & reps being used as a buffer between irate customers and the overhead who could actually do something to change policies and procedures.  And of course, soft monopolies over wide areas of service will continue to lead to poor functionality."

This is the principle that is at work when they're part of the exhaust system, and what gives them the edge over other aftermarket products."
q50,"I would be extraordinarily hesitant about this purchase.  I'm not seeing any hard data about the product on the Q and what I see on other models isn't particularly standout.

G37,"I've never heard that they have a special smell over any other HFC/Test pipes.  If you heard that, what people might be refering to is one of two things;  removing your stock cats (and not having a HFC anywhere in the system) means you've got unfiltered exhaust coming out of your car.  Yeah, it'll smell different.  Also, getting aftermarket stuff usually means you're getting bigger pipping that will run a bit hotter than stock- this will cause the chassis undercoating to re-cure (that will go away after a bit.)"
Spectrum,Couldn't tell ya without more details.

Spectrum,"Well, WiFi coverage is going to be according to your device and home setup, it's not a thing any ISP can increase/decrease.  Did you have WiFi coverage issues before? This can be caused by a number of factors.

As for speeds dropping off with multiple devices, they have to split the speed coming, the rating you get on any package is for the location and not per device.  So if you have multiple people in the home, you are sharing that connection.

Anyhow, I don't think any ISP can guarantee that you'll always get the maximum connection possible all the time.  Peak hours could see a slow-down, or for another example, the server you connect to for streaming might be at capacity.

It seems your choices, like many, are limited;  I personally wouldn't want to be stuck with the AT&T 25 plan... that's pretty slow.  But if you're just going to web browse and not streaming/gaming it's probably fine."

G37,"Because it's illegal to remove your stock cats for road use.  If you live in a state with emissions testing, they will probably catch you.  If you get pulled over and an officer decides to take a look, you could end up with a ticket.  So for liability purposes, Z1 is ""not"" ""encouraging"" you to make illegal modifications."
Spectrum,"Only the ""upper level"" techs are allowed to do that kind of work, yes, you should let them know you've been told it's the issue/had others out already, and to escalate up.

As for the speedtest, what is happening is that the server you're getting the low speeds from is having issues but it's also the closest and that's why it's automatically selected.  Manually choosing a different server, as you've seen, changed the outcome.

Anyhow, only you can decide if you should drop down in speed & price, 100 is fine for most people doing streaming/gaming, typically if they live alone or with one other person."

Spectrum,"Your post in response to a question about wireless where you stated you haven't made a direct connection in a while.  If that is incorrect, that's okay, you can ignore the wireless section.

As I was saying, gaming servers are getting high traffic day and night, streaming servers are getting high traffic day and night; the public servers that speedtest relies upon are getting high traffic day and night.  The nodes they run through to get to you?  The same.  It's not just you up late at night.

Anyhow, drop the sarcasm and try to keep it civil ""friend."""
Spectrum,"If you had read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spectrum/comments/g35kks/my_internet_is_slow_covid19_you/) first, you could substitute the speed test servers in place of gaming/streaming.  Speed testing servers are public servers-  right now, more people are using them, and they connect to you using the same congested lines that connect to everything else.  It sounds like you are also on wireless, so you should expect some amount of latency and packet loss;  that's why gamers use hard lines."
G37,"The ""cold air intake"" systems I've seen basically just replace the stock system, without the benefit of being a full long tube but cost way more than getting a pair of K&N drop-in filters.  The stock tubes and boxes work fine and keep heat out of your intake as they were designed to do- replacing them with same length metal tubes won't do anything.  So if you want performance on a budget, get the drop-ins (@ $100).  If you want the few extra ponies and don't mind dropping $4-600, get long tubes."
G37,"The number one thing you can do to make more power with your intake is getting rid of the stock filters.  The number one thing you can do to lose power with an intake is sucking in a bunch of hot engine bay air.  So, short rams get rid of the stock filters but suck in hot air.  Drop-ins get rid of the stock filters.  Long tubes channel the air into a smoother flow, and their filter position typically gives them the benefit of ""cooler"" (higher velocity) air when traveling at speed.  There isn't much difference between all of the long tube setups out there.  (And almost no one gets ITBs.)"

q50,"Oh yeah, stay away then, sounds like he's out to hustle.  Usually in this scenario, it's just not in a seller's interest to spend money demounting tires that the next buyer will replace anyway, you just don't factor them into the sale."
q50,"Not at all.  I mean, the way I would look at it is; don't calculate those tires into the cost.  If they are asking a negligible price (to you) there is no harm is tossing a message and asking about the odd tire out and see it leads to additional info.  If it turns out the ""Scenario B-3: Deflated"" is the worst case here, or only the one wheel is really damaged, you could always hit up ebay or one of those junker sites like slidegood to finish the set."
q50,"* A) Not Enough

* B) Improper Fitment, Bent Wheels, or they've been sitting so long they've deflated.

* C) Bonus:  The craftily hidden 4th wheel on the bottom right has a mismatched tire.  Is it because the previous tire was destroyed (perhaps in an accident) and that rim is hidden because it's all scratched up?

So my answer to the real question you are asking is ""I wouldn't."""
G37,"The stock cats are the most restrictive part of the entire breathing system.  Replacing them with almost anything will net you some power, but you'll lose a little TQ in the low end.  If you have emissions testing you probably shouldn't replace them.  You shouldn't get a tune until after you're sure you won't be changing anything in the system.  You can do full bolt-ons, not get a tune, and be fine for a good while- you won't get top gains without the tune, but you aren't going to blow up your engine unless you're doing something really goofy.  Breathing mods available:

* Drop-ins or full aftermarket intake
* Z1 or Motordyne plenum
* Headers & Cats **OR** Longtubes
* Y-Pipe (Not always included with ""cat-back"" kits, although it looks like the Invidia has it's own ""X"" setup so you won't need this)

If the belt/kit was used or older, it might have just been weak and you could try finding a replacement for a different company; check the belt number on the strip.

You could try loosening the tensioner, a quarter-turn at a time, it may be that you're on too tight; you don't want it so loose it's squealing/slipping but you don't want to crank the bastard down with all your might either.

q50,"Right, I'm still confused here.  Did you previously buy and install an axle-back system on your car, or are you referring to what came stock with the car as an axle-back?  An axle-back section is from the rear wheels back, i.e. the ""muffler"" section.

Because you are saying you want a cat-back system now which is:  the y-pipe, the mid-pipe, and the rear (axle-back) sections.  You can buy y-pipes and mid-pipes separately, and they should link up to anything else you have already installed.

So I was asking, you want to get rid of the axle-back and replace it with something new as well?"
q50,"Sure thing, but why not just replace the y-pipe and mid-pipe with aftermarket parts?  Is the axle-back you have not compatible with other aftermarket parts, or do you mean that the axle-back you have is also stock diameter?"

Speed tests use public servers to gauge speed, they aren't immune to everything thats going on right now.

Louisville,"So when you say ""outages"" do you mean that you're physically seeing the modem lose connection, or you're slowing down/lagging/buffering?  Is it all of your connected devices not responding, or one in particular?  Is there a regular activity you're noticing this happen during?

Right now it's high traffic everywhere 24/7, because of everyone staying home, and peak periods are swamped (Lunch breaks at work for those still doing so, the getting home routine between 5-6, and the evening settle into a streaming service 7pm~)  Nodes are overwhelmed, everyone gets slowed down, exactly like a traffic jam on the highway.  Many people are also experiencing higher rates of wireless interference and packet loss for the same reason; the 2.4ghz band is clogged with more devices around the clock.

When you say they're being tight-lipped, do you mean that you called in and couldn't get an answer?  Or were you looking for announcements about outages/maintenance and didn't see any?"
politics,Are they even Bernie subs now?  I see accusations on those subs that he was clearly a deep-plant by the DNC.
Spectrum,"Wait, see, that's another piece of new information.  If you are only experiencing drops on your computer but not your phone to the same sites, it could very well be that your computer's network card/capacity is aging or damaged.  Techs don't check you PC/Laptop/Tablet for anything.  There are so many links in the chain from device to service and that's why you've got to rule out these other potentialities first."
Spectrum,"Actually, that information changes things;  if your device isn't losing connection *and* it's verified working correctly, then the drops have to be server side.  If it was a local node, the only two solutions would be (wait until it's not busy) or (wait for spectrum to build out capacity,) and other local Spectrum subscribers would be getting the same issue.  So this sounds like a capacity problem at the other end-  the services you are connecting to are likely overloaded."
Spectrum,"I do, and what I'm saying is, the drops aren't likely to be a unique experience happening on your end that are managing to evade multiple techs.  If you are physically seeing the modem lose internet connection, and the techs are telling you that internally the device is fine and returning correct speed, the answer is most likely that your local node is being overwhelmed and the timing just happened to coincide with your switch (A decision many are making for the same reason you did.)  If anything, as it has been less than 2 weeks, I would continue to track/note incidences and see if a pattern emerges (time of day, frequency, length)"
Spectrum,"Have you considered that all the services you are interacting with online are under heavy load right now and may not be able to allocate as much bandwidth to you as your speed allows?  Or that with said high traffic everywhere right now, local nodes are being overwhelmed, and therefor unable to deliver maximum speed?  The techs you're calling in aren't trying to trick you with fake readings, they're showing you that your equipment is fine and *capable* of maximum speed, but they can't do anything about servers that don't belong to them."
q50,"You can find tire ratio calculators for web browsers out there, I can't remember which one I used right this second.

Then I matched that up with ""book size"" which is just an industry standard list (what width tires ""fit"" certain wheel widths.)

Also to clarify, being out of spec would mess with traction control/throw a code most likely, but I don't think it would shut down the awd system.  The stock ECU just doesn't know how to deal with it outside of that 3% range."

Spectrum,"Okay, so you can still replace your router and modem which is what I would be inclined to do here.  If that didn't fix things I'd take them back to the store.  But you introduced a few other variables in your last paragraph-  a usb wifi adapter, and some gear thats old enough to be out of support.  All of my advice is basically, ""cut down your variable to pinpoint the issue.""  As to your last, about WiFi, there is the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands;  the 2.4 is much more common, has a wider range, but has more interference variables as so many people/objects are using it.  5ghz has a tighter range that cuts down on interference, so switch to that if you can."
Spectrum,"I'm sorry, do you mean to say you don't have access to your router or modem?  As in, you can't physically unplug it or move it?"
Spectrum,"If you've had techs or others out and everything seems fine that can be checked, it's probably something more unique to your location.  Another local device on a timer might be causing a burst of interference, possibly a neighbor.  No way to tell you what it could be, with as many internet-capable devices out there.  If you have a combo router that you can plug an ethernet cable into as well, I'd try that and see if it's dropping on a hardline too;  if it's not dropping on a hardline, it's unlikely to be your device, if it does drop the hardline as well then you should try swapping your hardware and see if it still does so on a new device.  Keep track of what you change and when and that could help pinpoint the issue."
Spectrum,"I'm not familiar with the particular model, hopefully someone else can chime in on that.  I will say, if the hardware is busted and you need a replacement, you *could* get something that provides WiFi as well as having hardline ports for gaming.  Ethernet is always recommended for that, and WiFi issues seem to be the number one gamer frustration, just the nature of the beast."
Spectrum,"For some additional detail, WiFi or hardline?  Is your equipment going down and cycling or are your connected devices(phone, laptop, etc) only dropping WiFi briefly?"
Spectrum,"Yes, if it's coming from Spectrum and stated as such, certainly a legitimate outage;  is a reason listed?  If say, a transformer popped and took lines out, that's not anyones fault but could very much hit one area harder than others."
Spectrum,"It's a matter of public record and has been since the 90s, all the telecoms have gotten public funds, much of which was specifically marked for infrastructure build outs.  They just never did it.  Customers have every right to be angry about that and should be, just not at Reps that didn't make those decisions, absolutely."
Spectrum,"Is there somewhere you're getting this data from that I could see?  Particularity outages, if not from a self-report site like DownDetector?  I assume you aren't on all 4 ISPs, barring some extraordinary circumstance."
Spectrum,"I've never heard of this site, thanks.  As for phone times, the same thing applies here, however-  with employees getting sick in call centers, there are fewer Reps available to take calls.  And with so many more people calling in right now, the issue is compounded.  They lack the physical capacity to field all the calls they're getting at once.

As to your netflix/criterion issues, see point #2 in the sticky:  those content providers host that content on their own servers, not Spectrums.  So with many more people home, streaming, those servers are being utilized to their limit by users from *all* ISPs."
Spectrum,"Right, I don't disagree about people being angry at Reps that aren't to blame, the point we're making is that everyone could be saved such headaches right now if these companies had built out infrastructure instead of pocketing the money."
Spectrum,"There is always loss through WiFi, try switching to a wired connection to get more speed.  As for your download speeds through Firefox, it's not necessarily your connection-  any site or server can limit your download rate."
Spectrum,"I think Gronnie might be getting at the fact that they've gotten public funds for *years* to improve infrastructure, but instead diverted that money to buybacks and bonuses.  Now that we're in a tight spot, it's the same public (and employees) suffering from such poor and selfish decisions."
Spectrum,"Netflix, depending on what resolution you're streaming at, can eat up a healthy dose of your bandwidth.  In fact, it's likely to use *far more* data than a game which may only need to ping a server here and there.  And as stated, even if you live alone, high local traffic can affect your speeds;  Think about it like everyone trying to hit the freeway ramp at the same time.

You should stay on the 5ghz band if it works for you-  typically the range is a bit more limited, but it's far less congested.

I don't know what you mean by playing games or unplugging people though, do you mean having service shut off?  From what I understand, if you aren't paying your bills right now they will still shut you down unless you specifically talk to them about quarantine issues.  I haven't heard of any rate increases either since the last role-up to 74.99, other than people's promos expiring."

Things to remember:  Most of the country is under some level of quarantine; that means more people are home and using the internet through the day- your local node may be getting overwhelmed with traffic.

Finally, if you are using wireless to game, switch to a wired connection for a while and see if the problem persists."

Spectrum,"You can't get the ""new customer discount"" *because* you're a legacy customer, currently.  If you leave your legacy account you will never get a price that low (as a regular price) from Spectrum, and you cannot return to a legacy account once it's gone.  They also will not raise the speed of your legacy account.  Just understand, if you make the jump to Spectrum's plans, you will be subject to whatever price increases they decide for you in the future (And that $75 is the new ""base"")"

Spectrum,"Consider the greater picture in that you may simply be experiencing network congestion rather than an individual problem.  After that, if you are sharing a connection with someone, they could be doing something that is eating up most of your bandwidth instead of it being one of your other devices.  Thirdly, if you are connecting your PS4 to wireless, you are subjecting yourself to any  wifi interference as well as higher latency.  It seems you might be conflating bandwidth (available speed) with other issues that could be occurring on your network if I am reading this right."

As far as I know, none of the spring kits for the G have a total drop *under* one inch though."

politics,Kentucky that just elected a (D) governor?  Kentucky where the same McGrath is polling within 1-3% of McConnell?
politics,"That's not what she said at all.  She said she understands why some Kentuckians voted for Trump;  they believed a conman who promised to do things like ""drain the swamp"" and lower prescription drug prices.  And she further rightly blames McConnell for failing to put bills on the president's desk that Kentuckians care about.  At no point did she say McConnell was ""failing the Trump agenda.""

politics,Moderate republicans crossed the isle here to boot out Bevin and voted instead for Beshear (D); currently leading our state with flying colors in the face of what is turning into one of our nation's biggest struggles in recent memory.  McGrath has broad support from most Dems here and it's very possible for her to also pull support from the same crowd that helped oust Bevin.

I know there are also PCV-delete kits out there, if that ends up being the issue.  But what I would do right now is to just investigate further, see if you can tell for sure, where the oil is coming from.  See if you can find some videos or written accounts of the issue, and if your symptoms match up."
Spectrum,"Well, the number of people in the home won't have anything to do with the connection going down; but that will split the speed among you.  However, if you are all using wireless devices, you might be experiencing some amount of congestion.  Of course, you yourself might be in a bad spot in the house to get a connection or  possibly one of the hardware devices involved is faulty (computer, router, modem, wifi card, etc.)  And yes, it's safe to assume that all areas are experiencing higher traffic during both peak and non-peak hours.  Anyhow, there's really a lot of variable here and you won't know until you start trying to fix or adjust one of them.

Again, I would urge you to try zooming in on the map, particularly in your location to see if it's ""widespread.""  Downdetector is pretty much always full of people posting that they're ""down"" but that could be from any number of problems, not indicative of a system-wide outage.  It's not an official service-monitoring site, it's just a place people can self report, whether accurate or not. Your problem might be a simple fix."
Spectrum,"Downdetector's minimap over-amplifies locations so you can see them while scrolled out;  if you zoom in you'll see much more localized points-  if you zoom in and see the color still spread out, it's an outage."

G37,"Just remember that if you have the cats replaced, you are allowed to keep the stocks.  They won't need to be disposed of or sent anywhere; they are expensive parts with valuable metals inside-  currently a high-target item for theft by scrappers."
G37,"Okay;  You found oil on the spark plugs and you immediately replaced the valve cover gaskets and upper plenum gaskets.  Was it all of the spark plugs?  Was the oil fresh/still viscous?  Or was it only on one or two and more like old, caked on dirt?  Did you check the stems to make sure it wasn't just a bad rubber seal/o-ring?

Your cats wouldn't/shouldn't have anything to do with it...if the cats were causing engines to blow oil, it'd be a big problem on way more cars.  I don't think the two things are connected at all.  It's possible a cat is going bad, it's possible someone just wants to take an expensive part off of you and replace it with something cheap.  But a catchcan can't save a bad cat or do the job of one.

I also don't think adding a catch can is going to be a fix here.  Sure, if the engine was experiencing other problems and blowing metal chunks into your oil (or the plugs are being *continually* filled with oil) then yes it'd be a good idea.  Nothing wrong with having one, but this feels more like trying to throw parts and money at a problem before it's fully identified.  Try the easy, cheap stuff like o-rings first."
q50,"Okay, only when the car is on, louder during operation.  Well, blown speaker as suggested does seem a more likely culprit; that lines up with the in-cabin synth trying to play through it.  What I would do to further diagnose is to look up the [door panel removal instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9LHe8C7rPM), get to the speaker itself and physically detach the speaker wire clips.  Then start the car, drive a bit, and see if you still hear anything.  If you do, it's something else, if you don't you're halfway to replacing the speaker!"

G37,"The differential housing is separate from the transmission, it is the shell that holds the gears transferring power from the driveshaft to the wheels.  You can change these physical gears out for sets that have a different number of teeth and will determine how many times your wheel will spin for each rotation of the driveshaft;  This does not change the actual power output or emissions of the engine but will improve acceleration through every gear, while reducing the vehicle's top speed (Typically in a range that will not matter to most drivers)  Higher ratios translate to more acceleration, but as a torque multiplier, can lead to loss of traction as you burn through the gear much faster.  This is why many Turbo applications opt for lower gearing; you can stay in boost for longer while having more reliable traction to handle larger numbers.  Gearing choice is also important for those who do 1/4 times, as it can be the difference between an extra shift."
q50,"Any VQ will see a little bump moving from stock paper filter to a K&N mesh or intake, even without a tune, same with exhaust if it's more free flowing.  Just don't expect big numbers there.  You could swap the differential for a higher gearset.  Don't know how you feel about its' driving characteristics, but you could always make some suspension adjustments."

Spectrum,"Oh, nice."
Spectrum,"I don't know that there is any internal ""stop order"" that can be applied for, however, a No Soliciting sign can work wonders; for door-to-door sellers it basically lets them know they'll get rightfully chewed out for ignoring it.  You could have a sleeping infant inside, you could work night jobs, you could be an on-edge vet that doesn't like people banging on your door uninvited.  In many places, it's actually illegal to ignore the signs."
G37,"Oh sure, theres nothing wrong with getting a used one, all I was saying is that it's a hard sell for most people because the cost/power ratio is the least favorable for that section; $1600+  for  something you might not even see 10hp out of doesn't feel good.  Downpipe?  Are you turbo'd?  Anyhow, I never recommend cutting up the exhaust personally, it's hard to undo if you don't like it and usually leads to the land of drone."
infiniti,"Can you describe your current tune a bit more?  Was it a live tune performed on a dyno, or something like a mail-in?  It's just that you mention ""high performance"" tuning and it's not clear if you mean an additional map or something else entirely.  You also say it's set up for ""no CEL"" and that's not clear either...  have you specifically had the CEL disabled?  To me it's sounding like whatever you have going on, it's not quite right, as evidence by your exhaust blowing chunks-  and said tune will be off if the cats are no longer functional.  Again, I think you need to be very careful and have someone take a look very soon.

If you are getting a flame map you shouldn't even bother with cats because they'll definitely get destroyed."
infiniti,"Did you get tuned at all?  If you just swapped an exhaust on and immediately went out hard driving, your ECU hasn't had any time to adjust and your A/F is likely way out of spec.  If you are seeing pieces of filter flying out of your exhaust thats not good.  You are risking your engine like that."
G37,"If you're not ready to drop four digits on an exhaust, maybe look at doing the cats or y-pipe first.  You'll get more out of that for the price anyhow;  That's not to say you wouldn't see gains out of a y-back, but cost/effect ratio is basically the worst for that section."
G37,"You're just going to have to a) browse locally and hope you get really lucky b) browse online markets and hope you get lucky.  that's really it, some people spend months or years just sitting and waiting for the right part to pop up.  I'd say it's rare, other than the events of crashing or going back to stock to sell, that people decide they *don't* want a piece like that."
Spectrum,"If you're just here to goad users having issues, you should find somewhere else to be."
G37,"A real tune can add power to even a stock vehicle, as stock vehicles are made for the consumer market, where considerations aren't just about top power output.  The ECU will do its best to adjust to the mods, but it has no real way to make full use of them without help.  Running too many mods without getting tuned is a *great* way to get your A/F ratio out of spec and risk damage to your engine.  ""Barely do anything"" is relative, but to throw some averages at you; a full bolt-on VQ37 with a tune could be looking at +50 whp with improvement under the curve."
G37,"Nah, they're expensive for sure."
G37,"Like you just asked, if it looked damage in some way."
G37,"Well again, if they're a legitimate company/seller, they can be directly sued for fraud.  They would have a business location, a phone number and real people attached to the business.  The big junkers aren't trying to trick people, they just want to get that stuff out of there.  You shouldn't be buying something unseen, you need to use a site that has pictures available or request them from a seller.  If you are really worried about it and you don't think you can do this kind of due-diligence, just don't buy used."
G37,"Buying used anything is always a risk, but if you're buying through some legitimate platform you should make yourself aware of their user-protection policy (if they have one.)  For instance, a lot of used cats are coming from wrecked vehicles that end up in the hands of high-volume junkers;  they'll list the legitimate mileage at the time they were taken off with the assumption that they're otherwise still doing their job.  Listing parts you know don't work or willfully misstating milage is just plain fraud."
Spectrum,"As per your DM, there is no way to verify or not verify whether the names are real, it doesn't change the rules.

G37,"It's the steel/aluminium ratio;  the sedan is the most structurally rigid, so requires less steel in the mix- conversely, the convertible is always the heaviest because it requires the *most* steel."
G37,The sedan is lighter.  They have all the same components.  The modding aftermarket is bigger for coupes.
G37,"Get out of there!  There is no good reason to not be allowed your own parts-  that is literally how any tuner shop gets by.  And correct fitment of aftermarket parts is exactly how companies like motordyne and magnaflow get by.  It's not like you're bringing in some sheet metal you banged together in the shed.  For all you know, this guy is trying to push off some parts he has laying around unless you've seen what he's ordering in person.  And again, I don't know any good reason you'd have to replace the y-pipe just to fit in some cats.  The second shop is giving you a quote for (likely) one brand new OEM Nissan cat with labor;  like I said, they are expensive and valuable.

A better options for you might be to buy a used OEM cat and have a *reputable* shop put it in for you.  A used cat should be a few hundred, and labor is likely billed at two hours.  You can still keep your busted cat on request and sell it to a scrapper or something.

For that matter, you can just run with the busted cat until you have the money to do what you want.  You know why it's throwing the code, the car isn't going to collapse and die from it anymore than adding test pipes would.  If it's the only ""mod"" on there you won't be in dire need of a tune or anything like that.  Just be careful not to make an expensive rush decision."
G37,"Your post is not quite clear.  You are replacing both cats and the y-pipe (where the flex piece is located, not a separate part) for 1170?  Was this your idea or the shops? Here are some flags for me:

*  Shop wants to replace parts that aren't damaged?  Why?  If you go through with that, request to keep all replaced parts.  Stock cats, shot or not, still contain valuable metals that are pulling big bucks;  theft of these parts in particular are very high right now.
* Magnaflows, on a scale of quality, are on the cheap end of brands.  Not a bad thing, but if I wanted to be an unscrupulous shop, that's a brand I'd use to take your valuable stock cats off of you knowing I could get more money for one or both.
*  Why does it need to be ""custom,"" considering they're trying to sell you cheapy HFCs, does this shop have any particular experience designing exhausts for the VQ engine?  A pre-manufactured piece (like say, a Magnaflow) should save you some money here but they've opted for the expensive route?
* Have you had a second shop confirm the cat is bad?  Were you throwing a code?

This would be a no from me.  I replaced the exhaust on my old Z, headers-back, with motordyne ($$$) and topspeed ($) parts for a little more than what they're asking you."
Spectrum,I don't think so...at least in my area the switch to digital only was almost a decade ago?
G37,"The M has crackles, pops, and sounds different from a naturally aspirated car because it's a turbo.  The turbo requires more fuel and air (crackles and pops) and also serves as a natural sound dampening agent because of the way it reroutes the exhaust.

So technically the answer you are looking for is to buy a turbo kit.

You can get a ""tune"" for your NA G37, in that it will dump extra fuel and air into your engine and maybe light your car on fire, but won't necessarily add extra power."
G37,"Depending on how long you've run it this way, the ECU may have already adapted to the new condition and would need time to readjust.  I am saying ""no guarantee"" on the aftermarket piece;  if it's different than stock you've essentially ""made"" a new exhaust system that flows differently;  maybe better, maybe worse."
G37,"The point of stock cats and HFC is to *filter* harmful components;  blasting them with that kind of ""tune"" will just destroy them.  You just need straight pipes (Or a V8)"
G37,"No guarantees, but having a stock or aftermarket exhaust that hasn't been arbitrarily cut up will put you back (or better.)  I always try to tell people that cutting off mufflers/resonators/whatever isn't a good idea because they're designed as a flowing system.  It's not always about restriction (otherwise, why not just take the whole exhaust off, right?)"
G37,"Most likely your driving style;  the computer is giving you an MPG estimate based on current driving conditions (not a ""countdown"" until empty)-  when you park the car and things settle, it will give you a number based on the *average* instead (Fairly certain) at least until you start driving faster and it readjusts.  You're still low on fuel either way."
G37,"Seems like you're not throwing codes either, so chances are good.  The weld itself would be a fairly small area, but they'll most likely have to unbolt them to do the job,  so I'd expect it to be booked at one or two hours...shop around if you get quoted some crazy price."
G37,"Just answered in another thread, your rattling is most likely just a loose heat shield and not a destroyed filter."
G37,"This issue is almost always the heat shield coming loose, it's a thin piece of shaped metal attached to the piping.  It's not going to affect drivability/function, it is just annoying.

G37,"Getting regular K&N drop-ins like the ones pictured require the most basic of maintenance beyond ""nothing"" which is what you have with the stock paper filters.  There is a process to clean the K&N filter which involves 1) knocking out any debris just as you would with a stock filter 2) spray the filter with a cleaning solution and shake it out to remove fine particulates, let dry (quickly) 3) spray on a light amount of special (clear) oil that sticks to the mesh and allows the filter to ""grab"" particulates and do its job.

So here are the three major problems people have with this:  1) they don't use a light amount of oil/don't let it air out and basically stick a soggy filter back in.  The oil blows onto the sensitive MAF.  Boom, problem.  2) they can't stop themselves from touching the MAF during installation/cleaning, getting their hand oils on the delicate filament.  Boom, problem.  3)  something is already wrong with the car and engine oil is being blown into the air intake, coating the MAF.  This was already a problem."

The oldest models are certainly in the zone for needing regular maintenance and rubber replacement.  Now; earlier year models of the VQ37 have had some gasket issues as is well known, but it's not endemic, just annoying and costly if it happens.  There is no magic year for mods, just a rule of thumb- the older it is, the more mods are likely to be available.

As for your CEL issues, the typical culprits for aftermarket intakes are:

* Accidentally touched the butterfly valve on the throttle body during install, throwing off calibration
* Accidentally touched the MAF wire during install, damaging it.
* Incorrect MAF position during install.

politics,"If Tulsi wasn't running in 2016, how would she be mad at Tulsi for leaving if she was rigging it in Tulsi's favor?  That really doesn't make sense.  I mean, I get that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is illegal, and I get that the Russians are smearing anyone that doesn't go along with the narrative they want to push; but I think you were right in the first post, Tulsi helped manufacture resentment against Clinton."
G37,"oh yeah, no, i would not ha.  well, that same site does have some reg rotors and such, both their brand, others, and oem.  sometimes get in used oem stuff as well.  i know i've seen some dark coated rotors out there if you're looking for something other than silver, and powerstops not a bad choice at all."
G37,"I'm sorry, I totally missed it's an x model, so you don't already have the bigger brakes!"
politics,"Why would Hillary want to help Tulsi do that though?  I don't think that makes any sense, I don't think Tulsi had a chance in 2016, there's no need for conjecture."
politics,"Yes exactly, Tulsi helped to manufacture resentment toward Hillary for getting the nomination, you are correct."
politics,"The point was to make a ruckus to help divide the vote, to turn off a portion of democratic and progressive voters so they'd take their ball and go home in 2016.  She doesn't give a flop about Bernie or anything he stands for, she's just looking for places to make a wedge."
G37,"If you wanted to replace all the rotors & you want to spend a little, [something like these](https://www.z1motorsports.com/brakes/z1-motorsports/z1-piece-akebono-front-and-rear-rotor-package-p-13954.html) will shave 30lbs.  They do have calipers by section as well, some bundled with the rotors and pads as a package deal.  But yeah, dropping 30lbs of rotational mass is noticable."
politics,"As in, this [Jill Stein?](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/russia_dinner2000.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1)  Really?"
G37,That belt sounds a little wacky.  What about the battery?  Check cables?
G37,A light scrape and flex crack in the paint?  It's not a Porsche my man.  It doesn't sound like it's going to be a show car either.  What major issue do you think is going to be caused by this?
G37,"There is absolutely nothing major about any of that, you can barely see it even in closeups.  A little paint cracking *does* easily buff out, you could do it on your own, it's not like the entire bumper is cracked and hanging off.  I'm honestly taken back that this is giving you pause."
350z,"04 non-rev DE MT, solid pick; the old issues for that year and the 03 were some bad transmissions (most were long ago replaced) and tire feathering.  Minor issues:  window motors known to die, cam position sensors going bad, trunk strut gets lazy, sometimes when it's cold a ghost whistles at you.

Sure, the field of view is a bit tight, but if all your mirrors are adjusted you shouldn't be having issues.  You know, like any other vehicle, just don't blindly reverse.  Living with the Z day to day is easy for a single person, or even with a +1 and/or a pet.  Unless you are really tall or wide.  I once moved an entire futon mattress in the ol' Z, by folding it and snaking it from the passenger seat to the trunk.

Stay on top of your fluids and filters if you want to stretch that MPG.  The 05-06 rev-up years had oil burning issues, other years were fine (unless something is just wrong with the car.)  Snow tires and some weight in the trunk can help you the most in winter, but *don't* bank on the car being a snow and ice cruiser, certainly not in a hilly area.  VQ engines are solid long term, but most older Zs should be looking at rubber replacement by now."
G37,"...are straight pipes/test pipes *not* ""aftermarket?"""
G37,"Has no one here ever heard of [ART pipes?](https://motordyneengineering.com/product/vhr-advanced-resonance-tuning-test-pipes-copy/)  Yes, they're currently out of stock *and* more expensive than regular ol' straight pipes, but you can find them used.  I'm just surprised as MD is one of the most highly recommended VQ aftermarket companies.  I had ARTs on my Z for years and have a set ready to go on the G."
infiniti,"Come on over sometime, don't know why we're not linked in the related subs here."
G37,"I concur with a fuse check first, the tech that swapped the battery may have touched wires or something along those lines and blew one out without realizing. If the battery was all that was done, the only change, not much else it could be...unless some component just decided to fail at the same time."
infiniti,"I see so many people asking for flame maps lately, I feel like I should start hoarding rear bumpers."
q50,"Any battery that runs low can just be recharged (usually for free) at a place like AutoZone.  Are you saying the batteries are dying out completely?  All same brand or from same location?

To your other point, yes, if you have a bunch of devices that you leave plugged in they can drain the battery.  Forgot my detector was plugged in when I went on vacation once, dead battery when I got back."
q50,I would think any OBD scanner could clear the code?
Louisville,"All this foot dragging, the legal shenanigans, and questionable methods not in the public interest should be more than enough to make the case for municipal.  None of these companies have our best interests or needs in mind."
Louisville,"Sure, Google is a wet sack of decrepit dicks, but don't you think the lawsuits from both AT&T and Charter holding everything up had any bearing?  The ones to stop them from just accessing the poles like everyone else, that the city had to come up with an ordinance to get around?"
G37,"I have *seen* many VQs pushing 300k over the years.

*edit, seen ha ha"
politics,By all means show where she made the claim she was Pro-Trump as you are quoting her.  Perhaps you are simply spreading a Republican talking point out of ignorance?
G37,you certain it's the trans? all the driving you might need an oil change yeah?  cars can feel sluggy that way
Spectrum,Thank you for getting this all up
q50,"The bolt pattern is the same between modern Zs, Gs, and Qs, *however* some wheels from non-Sport models can't clear the larger brakes."
Spectrum,"Some TWC (and Insight before them) all got upgrades well before Cox/Charter/Spectrum took hold, whether it was an officially offered ""plan"" or not.  As far as I know, that pricing can't be changed."
Spectrum,"weird, well, the curious can still make it there i'm sure"
Spectrum,"In my area, the old legacy plan is 49.99 for 400/20; which is why they've been advertising a 44.99 plan-  they can't raise the rate on a legacy plan unless that plan is canceled, so I'm thinking that can't be the case.

Also, you goofed your bracket because the latter half needs the https:// to recognize the link."
science,"No, certain musical styles at their times were clearly associated with the counter-culture, unlike Gospel or Country;  it's not a philosophic question."
Spectrum,"Well, this step is basically just trying to give the hardware a boot in the ass and see if it can find it's way back on the path.  If that doesn't work it points to the issue being elsewhere;  If you are a wireless user in a high traffic are you might be getting congestion on the 2.4 band and you could switch to 5.  Also make sure your internet cables are securely fastened- if the clips break they can slide right out, and they aren't very sturdy.  Past that, if you can tell them you've already tried all these ""first steps"" with no results you should be able to get a tech out to check."
Spectrum,Did they tell you to restart the computer or the router/modem?
Spectrum,Advocating for crimes to be committed against others is not gonna fly either.
G37,Motordyne is a great choice
G37,How am I supposed to hear the exhaust note?  Are you hiding something?  Does it sound like raspberries?
Shadowrun,"* The Dealer got a shipment they weren't supposed to, which they sold on, and someone needed to find out where.  They might even be kept alive until said shipment is found.
* The Dealer took payment in a non-standard form; a special object or something of value- but it was stolen, and hidden, and the owner wants it back.  -OR-  A rival group or dealer is determined to collect all of The Dealer's caches hidden about.  The Dealer can only take so much interrogation, if the runners are meant to find them.
* The Dealer occasionally moves a very rare material for a very specific user.  Someone else wants to get to this user, and The Dealer has to *help*.
* The Dealer has trouble clientele, and one of them finally snapped after too many trips to the moon."
G37,"Nah, it's more cosmetic than functional, the hot air in the bay will just snake around it."
Spectrum,Soliciting help in entering accounts not belonging to you is not okay.
Spectrum,You've got to be kidding me.
G37,"I think on the longtubes, it's that they're sitting behind the bumper/fascia and you've got to unbolt the cone filters to clean them right.  Compared to a drop-in where you just have to pop the hood and unsnap the slide on the box.  The Gen 2 is a short ram so it's sitting more or less in the same stock position, but it's also more open to the bay and tends to suck in hot air compared to the enclosed stock box.  The Gen 3 typically seems to make a few points over drop-ins and other set ups because of the frontal position of the filters and also a likely smoother air profile at the throttle due to the tubing length."
G37,this was auto pulled because of the shortner but should be back
G37,"sounds pretty high to me, without knowing any details."
infiniti,"your stock filter is made of a thick paper material, and can't be washed like you're thinking.  these aftermarket filters are a sponge/mesh combo for better airflow, and are cleaned with a special oil."
G37,"I think you should pop your hood open and take a very thorough look around- maybe even compare to pictures of a stock bay.  You might have some type of aftermarket device installed and tucked away that is no longer working right and instead just draining your battery.  Otherwise, I've never heard of any type of *beeping* coming from there.  Mreg's suggestion of alternator is a strong bet too."
politics,>MEMORANDUM OF  TELEPHONE CONVERSATION
G37,"Depends on year and section.  Y-pipes tend to be the easiest to ""share"" on VQ models, but some older G35s required an extension for certain combos.  Everything past that is going to be different if it's Coupe/Sedan/X due to sway bars, mounts, etc.  If it's an HR series you've got a better chance of it working.  What years are you talking here?"
Spectrum,"Your network info is *rather visible* in this, clean it up and you can post it again.  But perhaps a better description of this issue you are having could help resolve it."
G37,"Well, ease of install for what you get is worth it at least, could call it a 1 hour job.  While you won't gain a huge top end out of it, power under the curve is nice bump.  With gears, you are sacrificing a top speed you're unlikely to hit and maybe a bit of traction to gain a nice acceleration bump.  It won't modifiy the car's power though, just overall rpms; however if you're setting in custom gears, it's also a great time to look at aftermarket lsds."
G37,Let me lay more burdens at your feet.  Have you considered an aftermarket plenum like the M370 or Z1's version?  Or changing out your final drive?
G37,"No direct sales, if you have a vehicle for sale through a legitimate sales website like craigslist, ebay, etc. you may post that link here."
politics,"Being 2700+ posts deep in T_D, are you saying you'll be voting for Warren this time instead of Trump?"
Spectrum,"Alright, OP feels ripped off , and thanks to those who made helpful suggestions about actions to take and possible misunderstandings about the billing rates.  However, attacking individual users will continue to not be tolerated.  *PLEASE* use the report button if you feel things are getting out of hand."
G37,"Headers likely not worth your time, not to say you *can't* make power there, but the cost/work ratio just isn't great.  Intakes mods are easy DIY projects, if you can turn a wrench, you can put on a set of longtubes and a plenum upgrade.  If you wanted to make the biggest change you could exhaust-side, the cats would be your target.  A tune is always worth it, just be sure you're done with the hardware side of things first."
Spectrum,"It's available, have gotten many questions about it in various forms, perhaps an upcoming sticky to discuss some issues around it."
G37,"The paddles install took me...30 mins total?  The hard part was waiting an extra 4 days for the undershroud that I didn't know needed to be replaced, whoops.  I've not done the peddles, but again, pretty sure it's just a bolt job.  The diff, if you just buy a whole pumpkin with everything in it, is heavy AF and a tough at-home job;  A shop could do the swap as one or two hours if I remember right, fairly cheap.  pro-only if you want someone to open it up to change gears or put in an aftermarket lsd."
G37,"See, the thing about the S, it's the performance model to get *under warranty* because you get all the goodies stock.  And it's the model to *keep stock* if you are a collector or want a good sale price from it down the line.  You will always get a better deal on a non-S, and adding used OEM stuff should be cheaper.  Some of the stuff you can get in the aftermarket is *better* than what you find on an S.  For instance; I have a differential out of a 350z, fitted with 4.08 gears from a Frontier, and also a Quaife LSD.  You could get the S-model pumpkin (or somethign similar from other VQ models for 300-500 bucks."
350z,Specifically 3% or more out of spec.
Spectrum,"You could stand to be more informative and less condescending next time, or keep it to yourself, thanks."
Spectrum,"Disappointed with the number of people dismissing elderly abuse/""that's just business"" arguments.  Locked."
G37,You can always start up by hitting places like craigslist and facebook and something might pop up local.  I usually see the same little circle of wreckyard websites pop up on there as well.  I ended up ordering my paddle shifters and a spare pumpkin from a reputable yard on ebay.  It can just take time and patience that way.  Sometimes Z1motorsports get random OEM stuff in as well.  Does it have to be S-model specific?
G37,"I see, your wording is a bit confusing to the rest of us it seems!  Still, don't be afraid of getting a non-S if you're looking for upgrades, for the price premium you'd pay for an S, you could likely find the same or better in the aftermarket.  Paddles + new shroud cost me about $300 for instance (all G37 are wired for paddles), BBK can be had new for about $1500, and you can buy a whole stock differential for $300-$500 (except for the flange which can be swapped, the 350z, G35, G37, and 370z all use the same diff with varying final drives)"
G37,"Yeah, now wondering if this hood is all the way down or if they've got an inch of clearance."
G37,"Well, I'd be looking for an X in Toronto unless I kept a second car for most of the year.  I'd also be looking at a 12 or 13 to avoid some of the issues of older models, as has been said before.  Beyond that, the VQ engine is a solid piece of work so high mileage isn't a big worry.  Just make sure the price isn't too much for those in your area."
