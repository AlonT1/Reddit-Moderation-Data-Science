The G2 front office (I'm not even going to rest this solely on Ocelote because I hope he's not the only one making decisions for a multi-million dollar esports franchise) has no obligation to Perkz aside from what their contract states. What's best for Perkz comes second to what's best for G2. And in this case, what's best for G2 is not playing against Perkz. So off he goes to NA."
leagueoflegends,Or Brett Favre. There's no way he goes from Green Bay to Minnesota without that brief stop with the Jets.
leagueoflegends,"Maybe a hot take but as LoL esports enters its 11th season I think the time for team owners and players to be friends has passed. It's a business now, and business moves need to be made."
leagueoflegends,Doesn't the buyout go to G2 and not Perkz? Unless I'm misreading what kind of buyout it was.
leagueoflegends,"Nobody forced him to sign that contract with C9. He could have held out on G2, he could have held out on C9."
leagueoflegends,"So the takeaway here is GMs/team owners should treat their players like employees, and not like friends. Which I can agree with as esports becomes more of a business and less of a LAN party in Phreak's Basement."
leagueoflegends,"Right, but there's no top tier equivalent league to the NBA -- cross-conference is as far away as you can send a player. I'm sure a team in the Premier League would rather field offers from Real Madrid for their top player rather than Liverpool."
leagueoflegends,"I don't get why this is a problem. Perkz wanted out, G2 still held his contract with a year to go. Short of a holdout Perkz has no leverage in this situation. 

Besides, he signed a 3 year deal with Cloud 9. Nobody forced him to put pen to paper there. He's getting $2.25M/year for 3 years. Unless his agent is shit and didn't review all his options for buyouts/trades, Perkz agreed to play in NA."

nfl,"The Lions roster under Caldwell had a higher ceiling than he could provide. With a better coach, maybe they win a playoff game or two instead of just being ""happy to be here"". So they let him go and gambled on Patricia.

leagueoflegends,"Right, and that's my main gripe with Scouting Grounds.

It always feels so dirty when I criticize Parise and Sutter's contracts, because they are two of my favorite players. But I've got nothing against them, rather the incompetent front office that gave them such massive contracts."
leagueoflegends,"It's pretty crazy that Perkz post-buyout will likely be more of a payroll hit than a few LCS teams combined. I can't hate him or G2 for getting the bag though, nor C9 for spending money on an upgrade. It just reflects the parity issue that's going to crop up in LCS."
leagueoflegends,Ryoma is a T10 LCS midlaner right now. Probably good enough to compete for a starting spot but I think he'll really shine in Academy.
leagueoflegends,"I'm a Wild fan, so I know about cap hell and albatross contracts all too well. The Parise + Suter contracts are almost over, praise be."
leagueoflegends,Yes and no -- moneyball is what the small market teams used to compete with big markets buying up all their players.
leagueoflegends,"It's basically the same track as the MLB. You have small market teams that develop and build players into stars, only for those players to leave in free agency because teams like the Yankees, Red Sox, and Dodgers have sometimes as high as 4x the payroll and can dish out contracts that smaller teams can't compete with. This is what happens without a salary cap or max contracts, and while it's probably better for the players it sinks the league's parity as a whole."
leagueoflegends,"I don't know about Europe but you see this in the NFL and other American sports where teams refuse to deal with division rivals. Now there is a bit of difference between not trading a player to New York from Boston and this, but from a GM's perspective I can't really fault Ocelote. If you have a star player who wants out and a team who wants them that won't play you often, you make that deal every time."

leagueoflegends,They're not really comparable. GGS and FLY are basically pet projects of the ownership group of GSW and Milwaukee respectively. 100T is its own thing that happens to have Dan Gilbert as an investor.

Without COVID, Trump had what looked like a pretty strong economy heading into 2020. Whether or not it was a paper tiger will not be known because COVID wiped pretty much all of his on paper gains off. If that economy is allowed to be pointed to as Trump's accomplishment (and see how he still tried to!) I think these groups lean Trump."

I don't think we're _that_ influential. It's not like we have an investigative journalist team on staff.

neoliberal,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved."

neoliberal,"I wish he could have stayed in to Michigan so I could have done the same. Maybe it's ""LEFTIST IDENTITY POLITICS!"" but as a young gay white guy from the Midwest, having a young gay white guy from the Midwest to vote for is pretty cool"

neoliberal,"He's not even 40 yet and he ran a moderately successful presidential campaign. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think he's the youngest to win a state primary. He's the future, man."
politics,I remember always hearing about the Michigan Militia with a worrying amount of reverence in the Yoop. I always figured they were all panic no disco though.
politics,"Considering not 9 months ago he was running a moderately successful presidential campaign under the age of 40, I can assure this isn't the last we'll see of Buttigieg."
Warframe,"I don't know how much health a 175 CHG has. But if I know I do 20% per shot, I know it dies in five hits."
leagueoflegends,"50%, either they do or they don't"
Warframe,"My issue with straight numbers is there is no frame of reference. If my gun does 100,000 damage a shot and 750k dps, that sounds impressive. But if enemies have health bars in the millions it's considerably less impressive."
Warframe,Thoughts on damage numbers being changeable to percents instead?

politics,"They also put a lot of eggs in the ""Burisma will sink Biden"" and ""Sanders will win so we get to call him a commie"" baskets. When those tipped over all they had left is the ""Biden... old?"" response."

nfl,How long does Pederson have on his contract? They might offer a professional courtesy of letting him ride the rest out for the ring.
VALORANT,"Not necessarily, if they frag out and the friend shits the bed or vice versa."
VALORANT,"Coming from League, it's ""intentional feeding"" usually by running straight to an enemy to let them kill you.

While just getting killed isn't as big of a deal in Valorant, you could see someone buy expensive weapons to feed to the enemy or something like that."
VALORANT,"Trust me, as a low Bronze I don't want to be there either. Getting shit on for 20 straight rounds sucks."
VALORANT,Wonder if that means there'll be more thrown games so people can tank their mmr/rating.
VALORANT,"And it sucks because it ends up being smurf v. smurf, and whoever has the better smurf wins. Low Bronze/high Iron you're already just about guaranteed to have a smurf on either team. It's gonna be even worse now."

Wonder if people like the Tigers and Wings so much because of Mr. I."
