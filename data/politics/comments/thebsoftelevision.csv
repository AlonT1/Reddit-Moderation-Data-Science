PoliticalDiscussion,"> Obama won it both times. This isn't a state that is hardline Republican.

It's not a hardline Republican state but it's not really a competitive state like it was 8-12 years ago. As I said before, demographics change and swing states don't remain competitive forever. 

>To say Bernie, an unknown Senator with no name recognition tied in Iowa is a perfectly reasonable point. You act as if losing my a quarter of a percent is the same as losing by 50%.

How did I act like that? Your earlier point was that Iowans didn't vote for Biden because they preferred Bernie even though Bernie lost their caucus twice. And frankly, even though your point never had any ground to stand on nor was backed up by any exit polling data corroborating it, Hilary winning the caucus in 2016 and losing the state by an even bigger margin than Biden did directly contradicts this claim and I'm not going restate this any further. 

>Free trade agreements, low taxes for the rich, opposition to M4A, unregulated Wall Street, shit like that is an abandonment of the working class, white or otherwise.

Well I can reassure you Iowans wouldn't be voting for Donald Trump if they cared for M4A, to postulate that that's causing Democrats to lose in IA and not the state's evolving demographics is rather absurd. 

>Florida went hard for Trump this time and also passed a hefty minimum wage increase. Zapata County, TX is the second most Latino county is the US and is very poor. Obama won it by 44 points, Clinton by 33, Biden lost it by 5 points. Oklahoma voted for Trump over Biden by a 2:1 ratio, and they passed Medicaid expansion. What does that tell you?

It tells me these states support these specific 'progressive' policy(which is also supported by the Democratic establishment) but not the overall Democratic agenda, honestly I don't think this tells a whole lot. MA voted for Biden and Markey and also voted down RCV which passed in Alaska even though Trump and Sullivan both won the state. Honing in on these individualistic ballot proposition/constitutional amendment is an exercise in futility. 

>They lose Presidential Primaries because the Democratic Party is shifting toward a neoliberal base. Additionally, the people who run the party make sure candidates like Bernie don't win because they don't want them to win.

None of that happened this time around, but I have an inkling you're going to keep acting like it did. Bernie never really broke past 25%-30% in most states and while that kind of thing got him through when the field was more crowded it really didn't go too far when it came down to him and Warren v Biden and Bloomberg on ST and just Biden v Bernie from that point onward. That tells me there aren't enough progressives out there to win a Democratic primary just yet, let alone a general election.

>He won more votes from minorities than any Republican since the Civil Rights Act. So I think your point about incumbency is moot.

He won more votes because more people voted, Bush in 04 had performed even better in Miami-Dade and won FL by an even bigger margin. 

>-[you in reference to Progressives who might not vote for Clinton or Biden on December 13th]

Yes? I don't think progressives who felt slighted at the DNC this time around existed in IA to tip the race. I think that sort of thing is more confined to Twitter where people it's amplified to an extent at which people think it's a lot bigger than it actually is, I don't even think that's a good representation of the average Berniecrat."
soccer,Telles has played plenty since joining...
PoliticalDiscussion,"> Compared to other gains that have been made, especially by Republicans, it wasn't that significant. Additionally, if Democrats did well in Iowa during the blue ""wave"", then isn't that an argument that IA can be won?

Clearly not. But really if Democrats need a D+8 year to match the Republican performance in a state, it's not a competitive state.

>By a quarter of a percent. I don't think it's unreasonable to describe that as a tie.

It certainly doesn't bode well for the point you were trying to make, besides as you yourself say later on Hilary was 'more popular' even then. 

>By a single percentage point, i.e. almost nothing.

It's not nothing, Biden's % share of the vote is what any Democrat could hope to get out of Iowa in a presidential election I'd say.

>Again, you say this as if it is just random and uncontrollable. The fact that the Democrats went all in on upper-middle class suburbs, means that they are going to lose industrial voters in states like Ohio and Wisconsin. It didn't have to be this way.

Those demographics moved to the Democrats instead and Democrats have chosen to embrace them, however I don't agree that Democrats have chosen to ""abandon"" any (white) working class voters, I think many of those voters started voting Republican overtime because of the appeal of Republican identity politics to this demographic. I don't think Democrats would win many of these voters back if they adopted more 'populist' messaging, at least they won't win enough back to make up for the voters they'd lose. You mentioned Wisconsin which is interesting because back in 2016 Feingold did exactly what you may think Democrats need to do to win voters back and he ended up underperforming Hilary in the state even though he won some counties Hilary lost. In Ohio, Portman won reelection in a landslide despite having voted to fasttrack the TPP against someone who was vocally opposed to it. 

>While the Republicans are still obviously happy to sell out to big business, it is pretty clear that since 1992, Democrats have been happy to ignore the demands of working voters. 

I really think this just means they haven't integrated your exact policy preferences into their platform which you claim to be the ""demands of the voters"" even though the candidates who run on these policies keep losing presidential primaries. 

>It also explains why Trump outperformed previous Republicans with black and latino voters who are disproportionately working class.

Does it? I'd say Trump's gains in those demographics had more to do with the incumbency advantage(which similarly helped Bush get reelected in 04) and a massive surge of voters in general, which led to a lot of folks voting who wouldn't vote under normal circumstances.

PoliticalDiscussion,"> There was no blue wave. Yes the Democrats made modest gains in the House but it was not a particularly good midterm for the Democrats given their status as opposition.

Yes, there was. In the house Democrats posted their biggest gains since the post-Watergate midterms and their popular vote margin victory was the biggest of either party since 2008 when Democrats had even more success. They were cost around 20 seats in the House because of Republican gerrymandering. In the Senate they could have said to have stumbled but they still won the popular vote there by around 20%! It's just that the map was extremely unfavorable for them as they were defending around 10 seats in states Trump had won while the Republicans were only defending a single seat in a state Hilary had won and they lost that seat too. 

>tied the first time, won the second time

It wasn't a tie, Hilary won the 2016 caucus and Buttigieg won it this year. Sanders won the popular vote in IA this year but Hilary also trumped him on that in 2016. But yeah, he lost. This isn't arguable. He lost the caucus just like Hilary lost the 2016 election to Trump. 

>My point is that Democrats did not increase their popularity in Iowa from 2016 to 2020 even though they had a stronger candidate. 

They did... not enough to flip the state but Biden got a higher % of the vote than Hilary in Iowa and also narrowed the margin of the loss. 

>This is the same absent-minded logic as bragging about how ""Biden got more votes than any other candidate in history"".

I wasn't speaking in terms of raw votes, Biden literally got a higher % of the vote than Hillary did. Thought that'd be extremely obvious but apparently not.

>You say this as if the states just left the Democratic Party.

No, states get redder. Demographics change and the political climate changes too. It's not exactly a new concept. Missouri used to be a be a swing state, but it's not considered one anymore. These things are always fluid. 

>Democrats have largely abandoned a working-class agenda while Republicans have, rhetorically at least, embraced it.

Yes, the Republicans have for sure embraced a working class agenda, that is for sure a thing that has happened. 

>Ohio and Iowa are both rust-belt states and the fact that Democrats have not delivered on working class issues in 40 years will lead to those voters abandoning you.

No, I'm more inclined to believe it's demographic changes instead. Again, these explanations are highly flawed and only distract from the uneasy truth which is that there's really no easy way to win these states back. 

>So are you even going to address why you think Biden and Clinton wanted a Sanders endorsement?

What is there to address? Progressives, despite making up a minority of the Democratic electorate still make up an important part of the Democratic voter base and it's a no brainer for Democratic presidential candidates to seek the endorsement of the most prominent progressive primary candidate. I never stated otherwise, no idea why you got hung up on this."
PoliticalDiscussion,"> By 2016, even before the election, pollsters and analysts were saying outright that Ohio was no longer going to be a bellweather going forward. The 2016 election--where, yeah, it voted with the majority, but had clearly drifted much further to the right than the rest of the Midwest--just sealed the deal. If people were still thinking it was a bellweather in 2020, they weren't paying attention--the shift has been clear for several elections at this point.

There was a lot of shoddy polling that showed Ohio being a tossup though, even from supposedly reliable pollsters. The same as Iowa, this kind of thing blinded a lot of people and Biden even visited the state thinking he had a chance at winning there."
PoliticalDiscussion,"> It's very possible that it's tied to Trump though and his brand of anti-elite rhetoric. It will be curious to see if the trend holds up under future conservative candidates. This is the same state that had Kasich as governor and reelected Sherrod Brown.

PoliticalDiscussion,"> As evidenced by what? The state nearly went 4/4 on Democratic Representatives in 2018.

In a blue wave midterm election, yes. 3 of their seats are again Republican now, their state legislature has a Republican trifecta, they have voted Republican by considerable margins in 2 consecutive presidential elections and both their senators are also Republicans. Iowa has a dominant party and it ain't the Democrats.

>That's what I just said.

Your point really doesn't make any sense. Iowans were mad that 'their' candidate(who still lost the state caucus both times, mind you) didn't get the nod so they voted for the actual Democratic presidential candidate in greater numbers than they did in 2016 when Iowans preferred Democratic presidential candidate did win the non? That doesn't sound absurd to you? 

>Although being ideologically the same, we have every reason to think Biden's candidacy was stronger in most ways, than Hillary's. As evidenced by the fact that he won. With that being said, Biden failed to make almost any progress in Iowa.

I agree with you, but I won't hold it against Biden. It's not like his campaign ignored Iowa or anything, polls kept showing a tight race and Biden was enamored with them to visit the state just before the final election week. I think Iowa and Ohio have followed similar political trajectories and are both states Democrats would be wise to stop counting on going forward.

>Really? You think leftists are all just going to vote blue every single time?

No, and I never said as much.

>I see absolutely no reason to think this is the case, not just from personal experience either. Why, after all, do you think Clinton and Biden were fighting with Bernie to get his endorsement? It wasn't for nothing, they wanted him to back them so his voters would come along.

I never said anything to the contrary, I never devalued the importance of Sanders endorsement and I never put down progressives. This barely even pertains to anything I did say. 

I think this whole hypothesis is junk, Iowa's a predominantly white, rural state that has fallen prey to the same sort of political trends that have gripped rural America nationwide, They're not voting for Trump because they secretly progressivism, or that there's some secret horde of progressives in the state that just never turns out to vote but would for the perfect candidate. There's no easy answer, and I don't think Democrats are getting this state back anytime soon, and I mentioned Ohio earlier which I think all of this applies to too."

PoliticalDiscussion,"> My point is that Bernie was popular in Iowa and greatly overperformed. There is every reason to think he would have won the general election, including Iowa, in 2016.

No Democrat was winning Iowa in 2016 or this year, the state's gone gone for Democrats. Bernie overperformed in the IA caucus but he still lost, he then went on thrash Hilary in the NH primary. In the end Hilary ended up carrying NH but losing IA by a great margin, primaries don't really tell much.

>Biden was Hillary 2.0 in many ways. So saying that Biden and Hillary both lost Iowa is completely logical. Also, Trump actually got a greater percentage of the vote in Iowa this time compared to last time. Biden also picked up some votes compared to Hillary, but the difference in percentage in both races was just about the same.

No, Biden lost by a margin of 8.15% while Hilary had lost by around 9.4%. That is despite coming fourth in the IA caucus which Hilary had won. Not a good look if you're looking for any correlation on this front. 

>If you think the political primaries just happen with the party leaders sitting silently on the sidelines eating popcorn you are gravely misinformed. There is always horsetrading going on to get certain candidates into office done by party leaders and others. To pretend this isn't the case is to be willfully ignorant.

You can keep calling me willfully ignorant and putting words into my mouth but that won't make your assertions any truer. 

>I am pretty sure that is illegal, although I wouldn't doubt Biden to do it. Regardless, that is definitely not the case, Buttigieg had more delegates than Biden, he was far from dead in the water.

It's not illegal at all! And no, Buttigieg was dead in the water, he had greatly underwhelmed in both NV and then SC, he didn't even prove viable in the latter. At that point it was just a matter of cutting an overcrowded moderate lane lose and Biden probably offered him some cabinet position in exchange. 

>If you don't think the Democratic Party pulling levers to prevent Bernie from becoming the nominee put people off you're gravely mistaken. I know these people. I know people who stayed home and, in some cases, voted for Trump, because they were fed up with Democratic Party leadership.

To address your initial claim, enough Iowans perceived the corruption behind this maneuver as a slight on their state to vote for Trump, but by a lesser % margin in 2016? You're really claiming that happened? It couldn't be that Iowa just doesn't like Democrats now, and this election was a natural continuation of their state politics?

As for the dropouts altogether, they're super old news but still there is absolutely no proof any 'party bosses' were involved. After SC, both Klobuchar and Buttigieg's campaigns were dead and Biden likely offered them some sway in any potential Biden administration in exchange for them dropping out and their endorsement. And really, this was not something anyone not in the online bubble took to heart and certainly not something that had any significant sway in how freaking Iowa voted."
PoliticalDiscussion,">She actually tied with Bernie

Not true, Hillary got the most votes and recieved 2 more delegates than Sanders did as a result.

>The party obviously coordinated the drop out of Buttigieg and Klobachar to facilitate Biden's win.

>If Ole needs to be replaced, at least bring in some one who has a track record of long term development AND winning. Poch will be too like for like

Poch's not a like for like in any concern because he had Spus playing incredibly technically proficient football over a sustained period of time despite spending much less overtime than Ole already has with us, he and Ole both like playing youth but Poch proved himself to be much more equipped at honing youth and integrating them into the team.

>If he couldn't do it with Kane and Son, I doubt the odds of us delivering in clutch situations under him

He got to the goddamn CL final with them, while Kane was out for most of their CL knockout games... what do you mean he couldn't do it with them? And it's worth noting neither of Kane and Son were known to be world class talents before Poch, the fact that they are now is testament to Poch's incredible player development.

>If our comeback wins this season are going to be discredited as flukes, Spurs' wins against City and Ajax in CL run are flukes too

No one's discrediting anything, and this is an incredibly weak argument if it was meant as a defense of Ole's coaching this season.

Yes, it is indeed imperative millions of Trump voters aren't led down the completely wrong path even further.

It's got nothing to do with a preference for 'hipster dream coaches', Ole's just not very good."
reddevils,">  While that might not be a lot, throwing an unknown into a match like this isn't very wise.

It'd still have been preferable given the alternative was a newly fit Luke Shaw being thrown into the mix right away.

>We set out playing with 5 defenders and a pivot of McTominay and Matic in front of them, and we sure had no qualms handing over the initiative to Leipzig who rocked us from the start and had no trouble crafting out chances despite our defensive numbers.

That's true for the 2nd half, but in the first half we created very few chances and our most potent attacks were on the counter. I'm convinced had Leipzig not pumped up the brakes at the end they could have easily had a few more, they also got very unlucky hitting the post and us being given a soft pen and our second goal being allowed to stand, I know we were unlucky to hit the post once too but a lot of things went our way and we still lost.

>We switched to a back 4 after 15 minutes, not 45. Formation doesn't speak to intent

I mustn't have been paying enough attention then. On your second point you're right, however I would say formations can tell you a lot, having Mctom and Matic both start against a dynamic attacking side like Leipzig was always going to prove catastrophic and the 3 atb set up allow Leipzig to hit us hard early on by exploiting all the space behind our wing backs and their strength at the fullback position totally made us pay."

reddevils,"> No, the press wasn’t solid enough yet, they didn’t squeeze teams anywhere near as well as they did the season after.

In any case, I still thought they looked far more cogent than we do now. And that is after all the time and money Ole's already had. 

>I don’t think there was all that much to be impressed about Klopp’s Liverpool in that first not quite full season he had. 

I agree! I don't think he did poorly either, I'm just referring to this one particular aspect of Liverpool's play then with our play now, which I think reflects particularly poorly on us. 

>Our press in games like Southampton looks like exactly what we’d need to do very well in the Premier league this season

I didn't find our press against Southampton to be all that impressive. It hardly ever is. 

>We need replacements for Matic on the 8, and Pogba and McTominay if they don’t improve that part of their game.

What we need, is a DM who is press resistant enough to assist with our play out from the back and also enable us to play 2 of VDB, Pogba and Bruno at the same time. We also need a natural RW and better coaching for more cogent pressing and generally better play, going forward."
reddevils,"I wasn't speaking in broader terms, just referring to our press which I don't think is anywhere near as effective as theirs looked just a few months after Klopp had taken over. Even though we have a lot better team of players than Klopp had available to him, at that point in time.

>Came in in October, finished eighth that season. Managed to get fourth the season after, but looked very fragile behind because the press was relatively easy to get through. 

They 'looked fragile' because their defense was lacking, no one ever really questioned the proficiency of their attacking play."
reddevils,"I think we have all the tools to press consistently, fuck even Liverpool immediately after Klopp took over pressed better than we do now, even with the shitshow of a team they had then. Most of the time, we put *some* effort into trying to close down defenders but all the well drilled teams have little trouble bypassing our press."
reddevils,"I doubt it, Ed really doesn't like sacking managers and if he sacks Ole now it'll be a public admission of him being wrong, again! I don't think his vanity would allow him to pull the trigger as long as we're in the hunt for the top 4."
reddevils,"I think that there are fundamental principles Ole's tried to coach into the team, like playing out from the back, intense pressing, etc. He and his coaching staff have however unfortunately proven themselves to be incapable of drilling these things into our teams effectively and I rarely see us excel in this aspects of our play, even when we win games and this ultimately dooms any good run of form we might pick up and leads to a vicious cycle of inconsistency when you can't execute these simple basic principles soundly and effectively. I think an elite coach like Poch would help a lot in these regards without having to change too much."

>Big factors against a high and well organised press like Leipzigs.

reddevils,"> ""Equivalences"" I never compared the coaches but rather their situations. I'd rather we give Ole more time than sack him for another ""top"" coach who'd see the same fate as him 2 years after their appointment.

I really am not a fan of this sort of thinking because it insinuates our situation is hopeless and it really cannot get any better and I cannot disagree more with that type of thinking, given the talent our squad has. 

>""we are too reliant on instances of individual brilliance and not capable of consistently breaking teams down with our team play"" So when we do succeed in breaking them down its individual brilliance but when we cant do it consistently its coaching. Love how you shift the goal posts whenever necessary.

Yes... see the West Ham game where we looked hopeless even with the likes of Martial, Cavani and Pogba on the field until Bruno came on and we ended up scoring multiple goals. If we were being coached well we would be capable of unlocking teams like WBA, West Ham, consistently even without Bruno playing at all times. 

>If you think Ole and his coaching staff haven't continuously instructed them to execute certain pressing patterns then I'm sorry but you are ignorant as well.

They are, they just don't have the coaching acumen to do it well enough to compete with everyone else. Again it's no surprise Leipzig looked so much more well drilled and cogent in their play than we did and this game was no one off performance either, even when we play well and get the right results I rarely ever feel confident in our play out from the back and our pressing is rarely ever good enough and even teams with a dearth of the talent we do easily bypass our press but that sort of thing is not visible when talking about teams coached by elite managers. 



> Thats why every positive performance is individual brilliance for you while every loss is on Ole.

You're just airing your general grievances now. You shouldn't put words into others mouths like that.

> Do you really think its a coaching issue if AWB made two errors of judgement and didn't close down his man like he always does

I certainly don't think it's a coincidence AWB drifts so central so often and he's definitely not good enough on the attacking side of things to be relied on as a Wing Back. That much is on the coaching staff who should have recognized they were setting him out to fail. Shit, the errors AWB made were more forced by Leipzig's strong wing play and they definitely set out to exploit the space left behind by our ''wing backs'', Brighton did the same thing too so it wasn't like this was impossible to see coming. 


> Hindsight is important and so is recognising the fact that if you want Ole sacked for every loss then you should have the squad sacked as well because more than half of the times

You're completely misconstruing what I'm trying to say by implying I'm being a reactionary when I have repeatedly pointed out the qualms I have, and have had in the past with the many deficiencies in our gameplan. Which I've been reiterating here for quite some time. And frankly I think our squad is pretty fucking good(and this didn't happen in a vacuum, Ole deserves some credit for this), perhaps the best one we have had since SAF retired and should be doing much better.

> There are many issues with United right now. The players and the coaching team being 2 of them, but they won't be solved overnight and won't certainly be solved if you get a new manager.

The coaching team is an issue but it won't be solved if we replaced our current coaches with better ones? Huh?"
reddevils,"> Martial was a naughty naughty boy shagging around his missus back. Jose doesn't like such character. I wish we swapped the cunt for peresic

I hope you weren't being sincere here... Jose never took issue with Martial's 'character', he was just distracting from a pre-season loss and stooped as low to bring in Martial's personal life to do so. Jose's most ardent defenders say the silliest things."

From what I have read, you haven't. You have instead derided others for being ignorant or insinuating they are reactionaries for questioning Ole's acumen. 

> Also, I dont care about Ole's CV or whether other clubs want him or not. 

Well you should, if you're going to set up false equivalences with the likes of SAF. It may grant you better input into why he was given the time he was and why we shouldn't use that as an excuse to bind ourselves to mediocrity now.

>What I care about is how Ole utilises his squad and how we play our games. 

That's exactly the problem a lot of people have with his coaching, against a team that deploy compact, lower blocks we are too reliant on instances of individual brilliance and not capable of consistently breaking teams down with our team play. Some personal qualms i have with our play have to do with our horribly slow build up play which almost always allows opposition defenses time to settle in in their defensive structure while we mindlessly pass the ball around the halfway line, our build up play is not cogent and our pressing patterns are lethargic and very rarely lead to us recovering the ball higher up the field. All of this was in sharp contrast to Leipzig's play who managed to execute ALL of this basics perfectly well, as a well drilled and well coached team should. That is the fundamental reason why I don't see Ole as the man for the job."
reddevils,"That's a bunch of malarkey, Jose had to go and I would even say bringing Ole in as caretaker was the right move. However, Ed should have waited till the end of the season till he was permanently appointed, and the fact that he didn't have the willpower to show restraint shows how out of his depth he really was.

I'd like to come back to your endorsement of Jose's actions here though, Jose publicly called out Martial for attending his child's birth, you really freaking thought that was deserved? Really?"

The second part of your sentence is complete speculation and not something I thought was worth responding to since you have no way of knowing where Poch's 'heart' is. 

>We got fucked in CL after about two years under Ole. Tottenham got fucked (although in semis) after 5 years with Poch.

Nope... they only competed in the CL thrice under Poch's tenure. 

>And yeah, seriously, if we're sacking Ole better go for the best of the best (all already managing), cause we already had managers who were supposed to be better than Ole and we ended up nowhere.

They were better for us than Ole though, but I don't think either of them were the ideal appointments at their times. LVG was probably finished and was hamstrung with a lacking squad and Mou was alright, underwhelming though till we imploded like Mou teams do. Ole undoubtedly has the best group of players we have had since Fergie's retirement and is not really doing any better than those managers did. Even ignoring all of that, I find it a little silly when people excuse mediocrity with failures of the past, as if trying something and failing is an assurance of the thing not being potentially productive as an exercise and not merely a critique of our execution. In any case, of all the managers still up for grabs, only Allegri and Poch stand out and I'd rather have Poch. Nagelsmann would be solid too if we could pry him away from Leipzig's hands."
reddevils,"You should link those reports then, Herrera was quite magnanimous in his comments about LVG when LVG was sacked and plenty of others, notably Rashford, Martial and Mata have all thanked LVG since for playing key roles in their development. Others like Rafael and Hernandez had less than a good time under LVG."
reddevils,You didn't answer my question though. What exactly has Ole managed to accomplish in his career that has you assured he should continue on?
reddevils,"> Cause he didn't win anything and as I like to say

Well, I find it really weird you'd want Ole to stay in that case. He's lost semi-finals with us already and just crashed us out of the CL group stage. 

>And I don't know who'd I go with, which is yet another reason why I think Ole shouldn't be sacked...

Seriously? You don't think there's anyone out there who can take over from Ole and take us further?"
reddevils,I'm not the poster you had initially responded to but we for sure are.
reddevils,Why do not wanna see Poch as coach? Who would you rather see us go for if Ole does get sacked?
reddevils,"And it ain't even truthful, no bottom half team would touch him with a ten foot pole."
reddevils,"He's clearly a solid manager, evidenced by his time with B'mouth. Very tactically versatile too, wouldn't want him anywhere near United though."
reddevils,"> People have literally had these conversations about Sir Alex, when we went a on a 3 year PL title drought. They called him a finished coach and what not I imagine that if social media existed then the reactionaries would have wanted him out after every loss.

You can literally use this kind of an argument to defend literally anyone, no matter how bad of a job they may or may not be doing. And besides, SAF had already proven himself to be a winner capable of tactical evolution back then. The hell has Ole done throughout his career to show he's capable of reaching similar heights if given time?"
reddevils,"For sure, ideally we'd land a physically able DM who is press resistant enough to be deployed as a ball progressor. If we got someone like that it'd also allow us to play 2 of Bruno/Pogba/VDB at the same time which would obviously be huge too."

Even if we did Spurs would still be ahead of us. Listen I'm no Jose apologist or anything, far from it. However your comment, aimed at defending Ole while putting Jose down was struck the completely wrong tone in light of how this season has progressed. 

>Pochettino will not fix anything immediately, so why not stand behind the manager and the team until the end of season and then start whining.

He may not... but we'll still be better off under him in the long run, yes. And if he doesn't work out, I'd say we change managers again till we land someone who is good enough."
reddevils,"I think it's overtly presumptive of you to pretend you had any knowledge of what his 'drills' were, and yeah we were poor under him, and he was possibly past his shelf life when he came to us but he also didn't have the quality we have now, squad wise at his disposal.

soccer,"He's proven himself to be a far better coach than Ole has, and we have a whole lot of talent in our team right now. I'm not saying he'll turn us into consistent PL/CL challengers or anything but its straight up ludicrous to suggest Ole's as good as it gets, coaching wise."

Where did they report that? 

>You're just repeating yourself and it seems like you have nothing to say other than reflexively defending Biden.

I'm not being blunt enough here but maybe I should be, none of your sources state what you claim they state, none of them were from even after South Carolina when the candidates actually did drop out. There's also perfectly reasonable explanations for why they dropped out when they, independent of any nefarious claims pertaining to baseless accusations of ""party bosses'' having interfered, which is just code to a lot of folks that surfaces whenever something, anything bad happened to the Sanders campaign. There are also perfectly reasonable explanations for why Biden did better in SC than NH and IA, none of them have anything to do with 'media filters', Biden not having campaigned in the former case, etc. The latter is provably false anyways, Biden and Sanders, and others all campaigned in SC leading up to that primary, I'm not going to continue persisting in this exchange any further however."

Please cite sources that say what you claim happened from after the candidates had dropped out, thanks. 

>That's why he did better in states where he didn't campaign.

I find it extremely interesting you dismiss the South Carolina primary which notably had a more diverse electorate than NH and IA, as not being 'legitimate'. Of course you claim the real reason for this is that Biden 'didn't campaign' there, which he did. A lot. So did other candidates. Biden also performed great in states he didn't campaign in, after SC. Which is only reflective of his strength as a candidate. And to go along with that, he also won states he did campaign in, like Texas and going forward, he won every single primary after ST.

Literally none of these articles cite and 'party bosses' that supposedly pressured anyone to drop out and the Hill's piece straight up says Congressional leaders were highly reluctant to get involved... and none of them are from after the SC primary when Buttigieg and Klobs actually did drop out. You're being super dishonest here.

Plain reality=whatever you believe to be true? Nice one, you're the one denying reality here though. You still haven't cited a single source explicitly spelling it out that the ""mass dropout"" which never happened to begin with, was compelled by ''party bosses"". 

>Biden lost the first three primaries. By no measure was he the frontrunner before super Tuesday. Now you're just throwing out irrational nonsense because reality upsets you.

There were 4 primaries before Super Tuesday... and Biden was the leader in terms of popular vote going into Super Tuesday. He had all the momentum going in.

>Old white people in the Midwest were supposed to be Biden's base. Those are his people. They didn't vote for him because they didn't like what they saw.

They are supposed to be his base, according to whom? His base in the early primaries was African Americans who turned out massively for him, specially on SC and ST but he did end up winning Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and basically every midwestern primary state but Iowa which is again, much whiter than the national average."

There is zero evidence either of Klobuchar and Buttigieg were compelled to drop out by any 'party bosses', literally none. You have not really provided any and the pieces you linked don't suggest this happened, because this literally did not happen. Now I'm not suggesting the fact that they both dropped out and endorsed Biden after SC was some marvelous coincidence either, it wasn't. Likely Biden called them up and convinced them to drop out and endorse him in exchange for some sway on his potential administration, which is classic politicking that I don't really take issue with. 

>Typically candidates drop out to support the frontrunner, who was Sanders.

Sanders wasn't the frontrunner after SC, he had the most delegates sure but Biden was clearly accruing all the momentum. 

> This was openly discussed and widely reported. I don't know what you get out of denying it. I guess knowing party bosses and major donors made the selection for you makes you uncomfortable?

No it wasn't, please cite proof that explicitly says Buttigieg and Klouchar were 'pressured to' drop out by 'party bosses' if it was so widely acknowledged at the time. What I remember happening is that some progressives decided, without proof that this happened because they saw this as a huge slight on Sanders since they thought every other candidate had some obligation to make Sanders' road to the nomination easier, which was already easy enough till SC. And the fact that they kept repeating this sentiment made it true in their heads, which is why I believe you likely see this to be true too. But it most definitely isn't.

[There's plenty of evidence highlighting more Bloomberg had Biden as their second choice than Warren voters had Sanders.](https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/04/second-choice-polling-michael-bloomberg-joe-biden-bernie-sanders/) 

> The latest Morning Consult polling, conducted from 3 p.m. Monday through Tuesday, found that roughly half (48 percent) of the Democratic primary voters who said they were backing Bloomberg identified Biden as their second choice, resulting in a potential 8-percentage-point increase in support for the former vice president. Another quarter said they would support Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), which would boost his base of support by 4 points, and 15 percent said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a potential 3-point boost. 

> [In responses from Democratic primary voters collected 3 p.m. Monday through Tuesday — before former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the race — 43 percent of Warren supporters said Sanders was their second choice, compared with 36 percent who said Biden. That would amount to an increase of 5 percentage points for Sanders’ first-choice support if her supporters move where they are inclined to go and a 4-point boost for Biden, clearing the field of their last major challenger. ](https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/05/sanders-biden-can-expect-near-equal-gain-from-warrens-exit/)

>This was a red flag. People who saw Biden campaign in person voted for him less because they could see he was in a state of mental decline.

You keep asserting that Biden lost the states of NH and IA because he campaigned there, but that's not really believed to be true by... well anyone. You can keep asserting that much is true when it isn't so, as I said he lost those states because those states are much more whiter than the nation as a whole and Biden's bedrock of support came from the African American community in the primaries. He campaigned plenty going into the SC and TX primaries and also pulled off wins there.

There was no mass dropout, Buttigieg and Klobuchar were the only 2 'moderates' to drop out and endorse Biden. That was after SC proved their campaigns were hopeless. There is literally zero evidence any ""party bosses"" compelled either of Buttigieg or Klobuchar to drop out. 

And even then, ST came down to 2 moderates and 2 progressives and Bloomberg took away more votes from the moderate lane than Warren took away from Sanders. Biden still won, even in states he hadn't even bothered to campaign in. After ST it was Biden v Sanders, 1v1 and again Biden still won every single primary from that point onward. I was paying the perfectly right amount of attention then."

Your original assertion was ""The Democratic base put Biden in fourth place until other options were removed in advance of Super Tuesday."", and not what you're trying to pivot to now. Iowa and NH were not the only states to host primaries/caucuses before ST. 

 >Yes, Biden had the unfortunate luck of running against a monster who botched COVID19. Otherwise, the senile conservative would have lost, considering how poorly he did even with those advantages. He also would have lost the primary had party bosses not stepped in to clear the field.

Your assertion still remains incorrect though... you shouldn't spread falsehoods.

That means very little, just because Republicans are going to make an attack doesn't mean it'll definitely stick in equal measure for each candidate. Someone like Sanders is more vulnerable to these attack ads because he's proudly embraced the 'socialist' tag, for example.

I agree, Democratic messaging needs to improve. The way to do that however is not for them to fully endorse all of your preferred political positions. Which is more what you were getting at, I'm sure. 

>A 15 dollar minimum wage passed Florida with more than 60%. South Dakota legalized weed. Tells me it isn't liberal policies people hate.

She didn't win the primary with anywhere near as much ease as Biden did, and Biden won a ton of states she lost to Sanders so that just adds to my point.

Turnout was only marginally higher from 2016 before ST and then it went way up in many states, and the beneficiary(and the driver) of this surge was Biden, and not any of the other candidates."

According to you, but as the primaries themselves showed that's not really true and Biden drove up unprecedented turnout both then and in the general.

PoliticalDiscussion,"I liked Bernie, what did the DNC have to do with Biden's win this cycle? Feel free to enlighten me on the matter."
PoliticalDiscussion,"There are a lot of reasons why I think that.

Firstly, I think the only reason why we got the rise of Sanders and the Trump presidency is because of Hillary. She was so loathed and despised, even by large portions of the Democratic electorate that her doom was inevitable. Sanders didn't fare anywhere near as well as he had against her, going up against Biden. Take the Oklahoma and Wisconsin primaries from 2016 and 2020 for example, in both these states Sanders had won every county barring one in WI against HRC but managed to lose all counties in these states this year to Biden. Sanders also lost many other pivotal states where he had soundly defeated HRC in 2016. And if you look at Biden's favorables compared to HRC's, you'll see he's nowhere near as hated as she was. He also had great rapport with Sanders from their time in the Senate so they likely would have had a more conciliatory primary.

>Possessing a penis might have helped Biden hold the blue wall but who knows? The election came down to 70k votes in 3 states which he easily could have lost.

The fact that HRC, for all her unique faults(manufactured or otherwise) only lost by such a slim margin adds to my point, doesn't it? Biden would have easily carried those voters and then some, it wouldn't have been as defined an EC victory as either of Obama's were but it would have been enough if Biden carried the blue wall and FL, which was much closer in 2016."

I think caucuses should be outright abolished.

However these things are going to prove difficult to do as both Iowa and NH have it solidified in their constitution that they're bound to be the first caucus and primary states each cycle respectively so they're likely to keep moving their dates earlier and earlier if another state does get chosen to go first."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Biden finished second in Nevada and outright won in South Carolina, all before Super Tuesday. So... that's a falsehood."
PoliticalDiscussion,"You're wrong, no one had dropped out to endorse Biden before South Carolina. He won there more decisively than any candidate had won any state up till then. 

After the SC primary however, Biden's campaign convinced both Buttigieg and Klobuchar(2 candidates!) to drop out and endorse Biden, while Bloomberg, Gabbard, Sanders and Warren continued to stay in. Steyer also dropped out separately but did not endorse Biden. There is zero evidence the DNC had anything to do with any of these candidates suspending their campaigns. More importantly, both Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's campaigns were toast after SC, so there was little point to them staying in other than clogging up an already clogged up moderate lane.

On ST however, there were 2 'moderates' and 2 progressives, while Gabbard's candidacy was irrelevant and Bloomberg took MORE votes away from the 'moderate' lane Biden is said to have belonged to, than Warren took away from Sanders. Despite this handicap, Biden still wiped the floor.

After ST however, Warren and Bloomberg dropped out, Gabbard stayed in for a bit before eventually dropping out and eventually dropping out and endorsing Biden, as far as I'm aware Biden beat Sanders in every single primary thereafter 1v1 eventually culminating in Sanders suspending his campaign after being destroyed in the Wisconsin primary, and soon also endorsing Biden.

And in any case Democrats don't have the Senate and are unlikely to gain the chamber anytime soon(barring winning both runoffs which I think are longshots for Democrats), so it's impossible for Democrats to enact much of their agenda.

They need to see that democrats are concerned for THEIR situation also, not just minorities. I mean in the first democratic debate, they were trying to out woke each other speaking Spanish and promising free healthcare to illegal immigrants...something poor Americans don't have...and working Americans would have to pay for.

I really dislike sentiments like these, I don't think many Republicans share your perception of their hapless selves which reduces them to one utterly without agency and authority. A lot of the GOP, i.e. the 'white working class' people like to talk so much about don't vote blue because they fundamentally disagree with Democrats on things and also despise people like Sanders and AOC(whom they very much perceive to be the woke ones no matter what you may think). This is also true for some other demographics, who voted Democratic in lesser numbers because Republicans relentlessly linked the Democratic establishment to people like Sanders, AOC and communist regimes abroad.

politics,"Slow down there fella, and don't put words into my mouth. 

I never said Trump lost reelection because Republicans tried to repeal the ACA, nor did I even insinuate it. However the one time they tried to repeal the ACA was when Trump's favorables with whites without college degrees would flounder(but later go on to recover). This is important and relevant because whites without college degrees make up 'the base' so to speak. I do believe their war against the ACA has led to Republicans losing the healthcare battle and most definitely contributed to Republican losses in the House in 2018 [when healthcare was regarded as a 'very important' issue by a majority of voters.](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-election-tracking-poll-health-care-in-the-2018-midterms/)


>  Trumps losing because of COVID. Had COVID never happened he would have won in a landslide.

I agree that Trump likely wins reelection if he had doesn't fumble his handling of Covid. However... he wouldn't be Trump if he managed to pull off something like that. And I definitely disagree it would have been a landslide in any case, Biden would have won back some of the Obama to Trump voters and also enticed many Democrats who split for the greens in 16. It would have been close and at best a repeat of the 2016 map for Trump.

> Also Obama got a second term because there was higher than avg. turn out which always goes to the Democrats and because Mitt Romney was a bad choice, he lacked support in most needed demographics & had no answers for how to help the working class. He spoke to the same corporate elitist that they always had.

Point is, the ACA didn't doom Obama and didn't give us Trump. It had almost nothing to do with Trump's ascent if you ask me, I think the general 'culture wars' invoking anxiety amongst some whites and Hillary/GOP establishment being so terribly unappealing is what really 'gave' us Trump. I also think had Biden been the Democratic nominee in 2016 Trump wouldn't have won to begin with."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Aside from Carter being hamstrung by a poor economy and the hostage situation as other users have already pointed out, another aspect that led to his loss that doesn't get emphasized enough is that demographical evolutions at the time were making it increasingly harder for Democrats to win presidential elections. The solid south was undergoing a transformation and had become increasingly friendly to Republicans over the last decade and Democrats didn't have the solid base in the west and the North-East they'd later be able to establish under Bill Clinton. So I believe Carter fell victim to the crossfires of these evolutions so to speak and these manifested themselves again to doom Mondale to an epic loss 4 years later, heck I'd say this is one of the reasons Nixon won reelection in 
such a landslide."
politics,"Reportedly Jared was going to put together a task force to battle covid until it became clear the pandemic was initially mostly raging in blue states.

politics,"He's not that politically brilliant and a lot of what he says in this piece is actually quite misleading. His 'contract with America' shtick backfired massively at the time and was accompanied by Clinton winning reelection and House Republicans underperforming in the 98 midterms.

PoliticalDiscussion,"It should remain but perhaps they can increase the number of votes it requires to filibuster to something more reasonable, like 45 votes instead of the 40 votes it takes right now to filibuster.

But it's not because of ineffectiveness of Democratic messaging that these states are shifting red(not that Democratic messaging is perfect, or even good at present) but rather due to demographic shifts. The upside to this is the Sunbelt becoming increasingly friendly ground for Democrats, which is where their suburban obsessions stems from.
I do agree that Democratic messaging needs to become more attractive to the white working class though, but that's going to involve Democrats taking some stances a lot of progressives and liberals aren't necessarily going to like."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Yeah, that just means they have to be extra cautious in their conduct and policymaking."
PoliticalDiscussion,"I don't think that's true, opposing Pelosi's 'radical agenda' is a very effective rallying cry in battleground districts and Pelosi is super unpopular in general. Of course AOC and progressive policies in general are unpopular in these districts but they're largely seen as an extension of Pelosi herself in these places. This is why moderate Democrats are seeking to oust Pelosi from the speakership."
PoliticalDiscussion,What the heck was the tea party then?
PoliticalDiscussion,"Because their voters are different and Democrats are, for better or for worse held to a much different standard."
PoliticalDiscussion,Because the suburbs generally oppose radical change and would never go for those ideas.
imaginaryelections,"It's not trending R, this is what Florida has always been like. They lean conservative when it comes to their statewide politics and they like reelecting incumbent presidents(they've voted to reelect every incumbent since Carter)."
politics,I think it's really interesting this is going to be the first election since 1880 where both candidates wound up winning an equal number of states.
politics,"2018 wasn't even close to Democrats biggest win ever, that would be the election of 1932 where Democrats picked up a staggering 97 seats!"
politics,"He's a charisma vacuum compared to the Donald, I don't think he'll rile up 'the base', so to speak like Trump manages to."
politics,"Her father supported all those things too though. They're very aligned policy wise. Hell McCain even endorsed Trump AFTER Trump asserted McCain wasn't a real war hero, McCain's 'maverick' credentials are very, *very* overblown imo."
politics,"Perhaps, but I don't think another speaker would attract the kind of venom Pelosi does. She's unique in that sense that she's been a right wing boogeyman for over a decade, is horrible at managing optics and consistently sets herself up through PR gaffes and is also just unlikeable for many people."
politics,"Well no, downballot polling was way off too. The Senate races in ME and NC were expected to tilt and lean Democratic respectively and as it turns out Biden outran Democratic Senatorial candidates in these states somehow."
imaginaryelections,"That's because you have no point at all, Bush won Florida with an even bigger margin in 04 than Trump did this year, but that was not indicative of any long term trends as Obama won the state in both 2008 and 2012. You can't extrapolate this very unique single election, label it a landslide when it isn't and derive meaningful conclusions about a state's long term lean and all of that when all the data isn't out there yet."
politics,"It matters what moderate independents want too, and it'd be easier to message to many of them without Pelosi's toxic shadow looming large simultaneous with the Democratic party."
imaginaryelections,"No, when you lose by a few points in FL you lose by a few points... I don't have any clue why you thought this was relevant to bring up in response to me saying Florida's still a swing state."
imaginaryelections,"That made no sense, no idea what you meant."
imaginaryelections,What?
imaginaryelections,"They also voted for Obama twice, did they stop being a swing state then? Margins matter and Florida's only going red by a few points, they're still a swing state as long as that keeps happening."
imaginaryelections,Also because he's Senate majority leader and Kentuckians are unlikely to get that kind of sway in Washington with anyone else as their Senator.
politics,"I don't think Trump represented 'radical change' to anyone. To many of his voters, a vote for him was a vote to shield them from progressive boogeymen like Sanders, AOC and co. He also ran on the conservative party's ticket who by nature don't favor change and prefer to retain the status quo because that works for their donors. This was also reflected in Trump's campaign rhetoric as he sought to tie Biden with 'radicals' like AOC and Bernie, which apparently won quite a few Hispanics over in Florida and Texas. I don't think they saw Biden as a centrist or percieved him to be what you percieve him to be."
politics,"That's not what they said... also moderates do make up a plurality of all voters, closely followed by conservatives and then liberals. And more moderates vote Democratic than Republican these days."
politics,"You should take it up with his constituents though, because as far as they are concerned Manchin is too liberal on some of these issues."
politics,I think Manchin was expecting a blue wave and Democratic takeover of the Senate. The fact that that didn't materialize clearly spooked him and he's now going to keep pivoting to the right verbally to assuage WV Trump voters who voted for him in 2018.
politics,"For now, clearly the electorate disagrees. But maybe when millennials overtake all other voting blocks and start dominating elections themselves."
politics,"But we don't know that their point is true, there's little evidence this election's vote surge was driven by progressives. Voter turnout before the pandemic was way up in the primaries, but it was because Biden brought in new suburban moderate voters into the fray while Sanders actually lost support from 2016. It's likely that surge transferred over to the general too."
politics,"I don't think you have any proof this surge in voters was driven by progressives, and I really don't think it was given Republican turnout went way up too and a lot of Biden voters voted for downballot Republicans. I think this previous primary cycle showed us there really aren't *that* many progressives out there. At least nowhere near enough to win progressives national elections on their own."
politics,"He absolutely wouldn't be, lol. And you'd need like 60 votes to pass the Public option anyways, and overrule the filibuster. That's not going to happen."
politics,"Jeff Flake did not help save the ACA, he was shamed into forcing the Senate judiciary committee to delay their Kavanaugh vote for like a week so the FBI could investigate Ford's claims and they ended up confirming him anyways with Flake voting in tandem with the rest of Senate Republicans."
politics,If AOC ran for the Senate in WV she'd get blown out by like 60 points because a) She's not from West Virginia. b) West Virginia really doesn't like liberal Democrats. and c) West Virginia really fucking hates anyone who wants to shut coal down.
politics,Republicans didn't have Trump in 2010 and 2014 either but they still managed to rout the Dems those years. If Democrats fall asleep at the wheel again the GOP will find a way to dominate again.
politics,"She still voted to save the ACA so not quite, she's more of a wildcard now than she waa during the Obama years when she voted with the rest of the GOP caucus to block Obama's agenda(but confirmed his cabinet and judges)."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Yeah, it'd actually be better if they remained silent but most of them are bowing to Trump like they always do."
nba,"Perhaps, but they had all the leverage since PG had just signed an extension the year before. The deal was pretty unprecedented all around but more borne out of Clipper desperation and not anything Presti himself did."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Not only did Democrats lose the House in Obama's first midterms, they lost 63 seats to the GOP while Democrats only gained 41 seats in comparison. Much of this is down to the gerrymandering Republicans did after 2010 though. 

In the Senate's case, Republicans actually gained 2 seats in 2018 while Democrats had lost 7 Senate seats in the 2010 midterms, down to the extra unfavorable map the Democrats were confronted with perhaps but their incumbent also lost in Florida and they didn't do as well as expected in places like West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan even if they retained those seats. It wasn't anything like 2010 was."
nba,"We'll see what he does with these picks before crowning him the best GM in the league, lol. I don't think the PG trade was that much of an accomplishment given it fell right into OKC's lap."
nba,"They already gave up a couple of draft picks, I'd be really surprised if they got those back + a player of similar caliber in any trade. I guess Knicks might be dumb enough to make a move here."
PoliticalDiscussion,"No, your initial claim was that Obama should have made a recess appointment which had a little more merit to it however McConnell ensured the Senate never 'technically' went into recess and when that was brought to the courts, the Supreme Court specifically ruled against Obama in an unanimous decision. That is how they would have ruled had Obama decided to make a SCOTUS appointment without Senate approval, because guess what... nothing in the Constitution actually says the Senate must hold a vote on the president's nominees, just that they're tasked with the responsibility of assessing the president's nominations. Obama didn't try this and nor has any president in the past, because it is obviously unconstitutional. But I'm going to stop for real now, believe what you will."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Maybe there's some animosity between them, Kamala does have the most progressive voting record in the Senate in the time she's been there though. [And Kamala and Sanders like collaborating on legislation](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/coronavirus-kamala-harris-bernie-sanders-propose-2000-monthly-payments.html)(that never really passes) so there's good rapport between them."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Actually you made the initial claim, I actually don't think any respected jurist has ever addressed this particular point because of how clear cut and obvious it is, [but here's a George Mason University law professor agreeing with my point.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/17/the-constitution-does-not-require-the-senate-to-give-judicial-nominees-an-up-or-down-vote/)"
PoliticalDiscussion,"So I'm being tasked with proving a negative... sure then, check out the US constitution.

> [The president] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States…

The Senate did not in fact vote to confirm Garland hence they didn't grant his nomination their consent. That's the base interpretation, the only recourse the president has is to make temporary appointments when the Senate is in recess, and those expire after the next session of Congress. There is no ruling, and no precedent because what you're suggesting Obama should have done is absurdly unconstitutional. Sorry."
PoliticalDiscussion,"> Roberts could have refused to seat Garland, which presumably would lead to at least a 5-3 decision against Obama's appointment.

It would have been an 8-0 ruling more like... please reference these jurists that you claim allow for a president to make permanent appointments to the courts without Senate approval."
PoliticalDiscussion,"I'm not going to continue arguing about this any further, no prominent jurisprudential philosophy would allow for a constitutional interpretation of this nature. The President cannot simply bypass the Senate in order to make a permanent SCOTUS appointment, that is not lawful practice."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Yes, it is unconstitutional and no respected jurist would argue otherwise. McConnell really had no legal obligation to bring Garland's nomination to a vote, it's not how things should be but it's how they are."
PoliticalDiscussion,"> I'm pretty sure they've never released an alternative plan on par with Obamacare in terms of complexity (plenty of repeal attempts, but no actual replacements AFAIK),

They did come out with the AHCA, but they couldn't get their entire caucus to agree to it and it never ended up going anywhere. It was eventually dropped and they focused on doing a ""skinny repeal"" of the ACA instead."
politics,"[He's the only president ever who's been impeached, lost the popular vote and also not win reelection, yup.](https://twitter.com/spbphd/status/1325513184892116992)"
PoliticalDiscussion,"No, it would have been an unanimous repudiation of Obama's actions. Even the liberal wing would have ruled against his obviously unconstitutional action in that case."
politics,"And who don't lose the popular vote, TWICE!"
politics,Trump just couldn't relate to the highly sought after pet vote since he doesn't have a pet himself. Too out of touch.
politics,">in regards to the mistakes the Clinton campaign made running against Trump in '16, but Biden's campaign was ran very smoothly considering the shit they were up against.

Well I for one am glad the Biden camp didn't waste a bunch of money in Texas like Beto wanted them to. Biden's advisors obviously had great political instincts."
politics,"Yeah, Trump always wanted to run against Bernie and even his attacks on Biden were basically attacks on Biden's association with Bernie. I think 2016 was more likely to be Sanders' year."
politics,"Trump wasn't going to agree to go into the good night gently anyways, no outcome but a Trump win was ever going to be plausible to Trump and his cadres."
politics,Trump himself always saw Biden as the greatest threat to his presidency. It's why he got impeached trying to get dirt over Joe a whole year before the primaries even.
soccer,"Let's be realistic, we're going to be getting none of that lol. Ed's not ceding power and Ronaldo's not coming back."
PoliticalDiscussion,There wouldn't be a constitutional crisis... all the courts would have just ruled against Obama
soccer,"Yeah, I guess they support Ronaldo more than the club or whatever. In this thread at least it seems to be more Real fans getting mad some of our fans don't want Ronaldo back. It really wouldn't make any sense for us to bring him back now."
reddevils,"Regardless of form, an injury shouldn't ever be celebrated by anyone."
soccer,"Perhaps but if I really had to choose between them. I would also rather get an out and out RW that's quality, Ronaldo's great and all don't get me wrong but he's 35!"
PoliticalDiscussion,"What does the filibuster have to do with anything here? Democrats haven't actually won the Senate back, you do know that right? They're in no position to be getting rid of the filibuster anytime soon."
PoliticalDiscussion,"She'll likely turn off many independent voters because she'd be deemed too ""inauthentic"" and ""liberal"", just like Hillary was. That's worth worrying about more, Kamala's got a very progressive voting record and was apparently Sanders' preference to be Biden's running mate."
PoliticalDiscussion,Democrats got totally wrecked in the 2 midterm elections under Obama. Way worse than what happened to Trump in 2018 too I'd argue.
soccer,I'd rather get Poch and a new DOF.
reddevils,"And I mean, why would he tell Rio if he were in talks with Poch? Not that I think he is, but if he was divulging that sort of information to a loudmouth media personality is never a good idea."
politics,"How exactly did I play the race card? Please enlighten me. The thought did briefly cross my mind but it was not intended to be reflected through my comment. Anyways, she deserves infinitely more credit than Sanders for flipping GA because she contributed through.. actually registering voters while Sanders, as the other user pointed out didn't do shit for GA other than tweeting."
politics,"You can go spout off but that wouldn't make you right, not everything is about Saint Bernard and inserting him into this thread is just dross. I don't believe he played **any** tangible role in flipping Georgia, and even if he did the fact that you would take credit away from Abrams to placate Sanders further is very telling."
politics,"Yeah ok, if Bernie really had energized so many progressives in the state of Georgia it would have flipped in 2016 and in 2018. More likely... Abrams contributions in the form of getting more Democrats registered is what helped tipped the state in Biden's favor. Not everything needs to be about Bernie you know?"
politics,"One day, perhaps. I think she needs to win a statewide race first."
politics,You cannot be serious. What sway does Bernie Sanders have in Georgia(a state he lost by 40%+ in the 2016 primaries)?
PoliticalDiscussion,"Yes, I wasn't casting doubt that it was reported as such."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Burr and Johnson have also promised not to serve past 2022, which is when their current terms would expire. Don't think either would belong in a Biden admin though."
PoliticalDiscussion,"If he really wanted it he would have insisted until Senate Republicans bowed, the fact that he didn't shows he didn't *really* care too much."
politics,"> Every Amendment 3 commercial I saw said to vote NO on it and spotlighted how maliciously the bill was written. I saw NO on Amendment 3 signs everywhere as well. I just don't get it.

That sort of thing makes a lot of Republicans want to vote for it even more though."
politics,"> We must have been watching different media coverage.

Yeah, we must be. Because you're conflating the Evangelical wing of the party i.e. the religious right of old with the hardliner Trumpers, the latter is never going to swear off the man but the former group never really loved him to begin with. It's why Trump had to nominate Mike Pence as his VP to begin with, because he wanted to shore up support with these people."
PoliticalDiscussion,"He was never going to issue one either way, it's something that'd unnecessarily cost him political capital with Democrats and it nets him nothing."
PoliticalDiscussion,"I don't think it means anything, yes. There's certainly plenty of political orthodoxy Trump's defied but I'd chalk this one up to pure coincidence."
politics,"He hardly lost because of his aggressive style of governing, most people aren't tuned in to even have heard about any of that stuff let alone knowing what it meant or how damaging it might've been. And yeah, we have processes in place for a reason and those processes allow for this to happen, Biden should and will take advantage of these ""processes"" just like Trump did."
politics,"Yeah, Golden winning reelection is certainly impressive given the fact that Trump carried his district. Maine's independent streak on full show."
PoliticalDiscussion,It won't be Biden doing the prosecuting...
PoliticalDiscussion,"I don't understand why anyone would expect presidents to own pets or whatever, I don't see why that qualifies as being 'weird'. I'm tired of restating my position so I'll stop here."
PoliticalDiscussion,"But... why? Do you think people who don't own pets are weird in general? I don't, I don't understand why this is weird in the slightest."
politics,"I doubt it effects anything at all, Trump got like 70 million votes despite unprecedented executive overreach and frankly I don't expect the next Republican president to behave any differently, there's just no point to Democrats playing with their hands tied behind their backs in this regard anymore."
PoliticalDiscussion,That doesn't make it weird.
politics,"If the Senate doesn't want to play along what else can Biden do? Anyways, it wouldn't be like Trump because Biden would be enacting positive change."
politics,"Highly doubt many people over 40 are Pelosi fans either, she's not some centrist idol and actually is a liability to be associated with in these swing districts. And she's hardly perceived as any sort of centrist by anyone but progressives, Democrats would be wise to elect a speaker without the decades worth of animosity Pelosi has built up with the right but also someone not prone to PR gaffes like Pelosi is. She may be decent at whipping up votes but electorally she is a liability and I believe this is something much of the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic party now agree with."
politics,"> The Evangelicals are maybe the biggest part of the problem. Reason doesn't hold any sway with them. It only takes a handful of thought leaders to poison tens of thousands of people who count on them for guidance. They're dedicated hardliners that vote in lock step.

Yeah, but it's not like they love Trump. They tolerate him because he is a means to an end for them, when he can no longer appoint hardline conservative jurists to the courts they'll have no reason to go along with the charade. Support for Trump will likely wane with them once he's out of office."
PoliticalDiscussion,Rare? Perhaps. Weird? No it isn't.
politics,"Republicans aren't exactly a big tent and not a whole lot of them are never-Trumpers, but maybe they can get the Evangelical/strictly corporatist wing of the party to swear off Trump."
politics,"Seems like polling way way off and Collins managed to preserve her image of a bipartisan actor. Not surprising if you realize the margins she previously got reelected with, Gideon also kinda laid low and let the whole thing be a referendum on Trump which didn't work out in her favor."
politics,"Yeah, Trump really loved playing the unitary executive which is enough precedent for Biden to act similarly."
politics,"> Well...the data shows that sanders supporters doubled and even tripled in places. 

Which states would this be? What data? 

>The data also shows that older liberals”boomers” turned out against him

Again, what data? 

>What you think happened and what the data shows are two different things.

I can't even refute any of this until you actually show me the data."
PoliticalDiscussion,Biden's also said he won't issue Trump a pardon.
PoliticalDiscussion,"> They waited to call the election quite a while to avoid calling it based on arizona

I think they waited that long to avoid pissing off the Trump campaign and not because they weren't confident in their AZ call. 

DDHQ otoh were the only ones to call the election as soon as it became clear Biden was winning PA."
PoliticalDiscussion,"The forecast's predicted popular vote margins were way off though. But yes, the model can only count on being as good as the polling data, and the polling was again, for the most part very off."
PoliticalDiscussion,"But the margins were still extremely close meaning the state's still in play. Republicans also lost the state to Obama twice, but they didn't give up on the state then did they? As I said, Democrats just need to reexamine why it is that the state keeps going red by these small margins. I think Ohio and Iowa however are real lost causes for Democrats."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Democrats really need to look into why they keep losing FL and NC by these narrow margins now, it's not wise to cede those states to the GOP though."
politics,No biggie.
PoliticalDiscussion,It's not really weird to not have a pet.
politics,"> A higher proportion of republicans voted trump in 2020 than 2016.

By a percentage or two perhaps, I hadn't looked at that aspect of exit polling and you're right. However you didn't specify you were referring to percentages in your earlier comment, and I would still argue Biden managed to poach off many Republican voters(whether they be registered Republicans, or Republican voting independents) which is corroborated by Republican senatorial candidates and House candidates outpacing Trump everywhere and overperforming their polling to a larger extent than Trump himself. 

>What the hell are you talking about. WE LITERALLY HAVE THE PERCENTAGES. trump gained at least 1 point with republicans this election. that means that biden did worse with republicans than clinton did. HE FAILED. thats PROOF.

So you're intentionally conflating non-self identifying Republican swing voters with progressives to prove your point? Biden did better with suburbanites and older voters than HRC had, Biden outperformed other Democratic congressional candidates. When I said ""Republicans"" I clearly meant all Republican voters and not just registered or self identifying Republicans, perhaps I should have been more clear with my wording there."
politics,[NYT Exit polling](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html) which shows Biden having won suburbanites 51%-48% while HRC lost the suburbs [45%-49%](https://edition.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls) in 2016. Also corroborated by the fact that many of these places Biden won/outperformed HRC in still voted Republican downballot.
