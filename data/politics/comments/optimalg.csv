1. Not really. They represent the state in a formal sense, but the state sometimes/often does things I don't agree with. My nationality does not define me as a person.

2. I'm fine with it. They can't really have normal jobs (though Willem-Alexander used to be a pilot for KLM before his coronation) and their position requires a certain level of spending. The extended family can make it perfectly fine on their own, though.

3. There's a Republican Society, it gets a reasonable amount of attention at certain times (usually around King's Day, April 27), but it's really not on people's minds. The royal family is just not enough of a burden, a hindrance or an annoyance to everyday life and politics. And I guess that's also my view. Let's be honest: ""the principle of the thing"" is not a very compelling reason to overhaul the entire polity of a well-functioning democratic state, especially when there's no concrete plan for what the alternative will be."

soccer,One of the two teams (DWSV) recently came in the (local) news after a referee was chased off the pitch by a spectator with what appeared to be a knife.
neoliberal,I honestly wonder if the çomars got to her. I doubt making such a weird statement to the benefit of Turkish interests will go over well with her pro-Kurdish base.
neoliberal,"Literally ""all lives matter""."
soccer,[This tackle](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2turbv) (obviously not for the squeamish) already went to court and resulted in a suspended 6 month sentence and 200 hours of community service.
soccer,"You may like the [effortpost I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8dutgq/the_case_of_niels_kokmeijer_or_when_should_a_hard) a year ago about it, as well as the discussion in it. Litigation has already happened in some cases, including criminal prosecution."
soccer,"Well, [not exactly the most expensive anymore.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-16343million-football-career-that-never-was-891508.html)"
politics,"That's right. My schedule didn't account for the fact that DST ends on a different date in the US, so I assumed it'd be the normal time."
politics,"That's not intentional, DST ended in Europe yesterday."
AjaxAmsterdam,AZ is more likely to fuck up against the likes of VVV or PEC Zwolle. Still think they end in 3rd place.
AjaxAmsterdam,"AZ are now ahead on GD. You may want to switch the rival watch subject next week, lmao."
soccer,"Fantastic first half with an honestly shocking display by Feyenoord. Unfortunately the second half was really complacent and sloppy, where the mentality of ""Whatever, it's 4-0"" oozed through. Should have brought Gravenberch and Traoré earlier, they probably would still want to show something.

But this has been a great round. For the first time in years Ajax are actually far ahead, so I can't complain too much."
soccer,"I'm honestly insulted by Feyenoord's display in the first half. There's no creativity, no urgency, no motivation. Even Mario Been's team put up more of a fight."
soccer,"Holy shit, you weren't kidding."
soccer,Feyenoord is inconsistent more than anything else. And not losing against Ajax in the ArenA would be the most inconsistent thing.
neoliberal,"Decriminalization is not the same as legalization. While it has its pragmatic benefits and is certainly an option for tackling the social issues of addiction, you create a legal limbo wherein criminal organizations continue to operate. So, decriminalization makes sense for hard drugs, but in my opinion marijuana really needs to be fully legalized and regulated."
neoliberal,Ideally it should be combined with a single battery standard for all cars. But I'm not seeing that happening anytime soon. Probably never.
neoliberal,[Checking in on /r/soccer](https://i.imgur.com/KkTLC0t.gifv)
soccer,They'd probably have brought some kroketten with them if asked.
soccer,"One part of Belgium already has issues sharing a country with the other part of Belgium, let alone two different countries."
soccer,"Match fixing generally isn't done with big matches and sweeping actions anymore. It's usually things like ""this team from the Kazakh third tier will get the first throw-in""."
soccer,What an idiotic challenge. Makes zero sense for a keeper to try and intercept like that.
soccer,"Marcel Desailly, the unwitting creator of [a legendary Ajax moment.](https://youtu.be/9EuFLQbuN0g)"
soccer,"They can change the rules through IFAB, so it's important that they are aware of issues with how the rules are currently implemented."
soccer,Stay away from threads with PL teams. It's a general rule on here.
thenetherlands,Vraag Duitsland of ze die Leopard 2-tanks nog ergens hebben staan.
soccer,"Hey, that's the old logo."
soccer,On the bright side for PSV: they're going to have an infinitely more competent lineup against AZ now.
soccer,"Everything about this game oozes the mentality ""it's RKC, what could _possibly_ go wrong?"" and it annoys me immensely."

I hoped the day would never come, but it's finally here. [My club now has enough foreign plastic followers to have the replies to a pro-LGBT tweet be full of terrible comments.](https://twitter.com/AFCAjax/status/1185576100669349889?s=19)

It's like they don't even know what city the club is from."
politics,The death penalty is more expensive than life imprisonment. Legal costs are exponentially higher.
neoliberal,"At least the commies have either read theory, pretended they have or encourage people to do so. It beats getting information through frog memes and unhinged forum rants."
soccer,"I get not making the pitch smaller, that leads to logistical problems. Lines would need to be redrawn over and over again. But goals can be replaced in a few minutes."
AjaxAmsterdam,"Newcastle isn't exactly a big club. Haven't won anything worthwhile since the 1950s and only had a brief period of European football in the late 90s and early 2000s. It just looks big because it has a massive following and is the only pro club in the city, which is rare in England. They're like the English ADO."
neoliberal,"99% of all ""banned from"" stories are misrepresented."
neoliberal,I always love to receive your fanmail. See you tomorrow.
neoliberal,"Esto, pero sin ironía."
neoliberal,"Ik ben een half uur te laat voor een belangrijke afspraak vanwege die stoet pr*vincialen. Ze kunnen me wat, ik koop deze week buitenlandse waar."
soccer,Andorra is probably going to finish above Moldova in their group by scoring _one_ goal. They're now ahead of them on GD (-15 to -20) and Moldova still have to play France and Iceland.
soccer,"On the bright side, Feyenoord managed to get two goals past Köselev instead of only one."
soccer,"I wanted to get some comparison with other countries, so I looked up the stats for my own country. In 2018 the KNVB reported that they have slightly over [1,200,000 members, which accounts for roughly 7% of the total population of the Netherlands](https://knvb.h5mag.com/jaarverslag_2017-18/de_knvb_in_cijfers). 538,000 of those members were men playing in regular competitions (see the PDF). There are around [2,000,000](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/achtergrond/2018/35/mannen-en-vrouwen-per-leeftijdsgroep) men between the ages of 20 and 40 in the Netherlands (U19 is another bracket), so that's a _quarter_ of the male population playing football.

So that may actually be a normal percentage."
soccer,"San Marino is small enough that they may live outside the country. It's a half hour drive from Rimini, for instance."
soccer,But that's assuming only Sammarinese men are playing at those clubs. There are also lots of Italians from the surrounding areas playing in the league. They're even a majority in some of the top flight squads.
ModSupport,"Your ability to tolerate inane shill accusations, mostly."
ModSupport,That doesn't seem very fair towards other subreddits that may use this feature. Especially because /r/politics already has an open mod application process.
soccer,"Okay, new advanced football tactic: Cillessen should score an own goal in the first minute from now on. Then maybe that makes the team actually play with a sense of urgency."
soccer,It beats Kleintje Pils any day of the week.
AjaxAmsterdam,"Don't we all, Nico. 😔"
neoliberal,"Tulsi is considering a boycott of the October 15 debates, in the same way I'm considering a boycott of Ferrari, the Bahamian branch of Hilton Resorts and the luxury yacht industry."
AjaxAmsterdam,"It looks good with jeans. Still think it's not an ideal colour for a kit, but you can't beat the appeal for casual wear."
soccer,It seems to happen almost exclusively to players who have a prefix or double name. Apparently the Anglosphere has a crippling fear of spaces.
soccer,"I have the same issue with VVD. It's a Dutch political party, not a football player."
thenetherlands,Er zou waarschijnlijk veel minder verzet tegen deze wet zijn geweest als het alleen voor _nieuwe_ BIG-registraties had geteld. Want ik zie wel in waarom een sterkere afbakening gewenst is.
thenetherlands,"Degelijke acties resulteren altijd in royement. Ik citeer uit de statuten:

>Ontzetting kan alleen worden uitgesproken wanneer een lid in strijd handelt met de statuten 
en de door de algemene vergadering vastgestelde reglementen of besluiten **of wanneer hij de VVD 
op onredelijke wijze benadeelt.**

Het lijkt me dat zetelroof daar wel onder zal vallen."
thenetherlands,">Blijkbaar ging dat in touwtje-uit-de-brievenbus-tijden wel altijd goed? Kan het me niet voorstellen eigenlijk. 

In 1983 werd mijn opa aangereden door een man uit de Amsterdamse onderwereld. De man in kwestie reed veel te hard en zijn auto was onverzekerd, maar eiste dat mijn opa de schade zou vergoeden. Die weigerde dat. 

Een aantal maanden van expliciete bedreigingen over de telefoon volgden. De politie kon schijnbaar weinig doen vanwege de onderwereldcontacten. Op een gegeven moment noemde hij het adres van mijn moeder, die toen nog studeerde in Amsterdam, en was de maat vol. Uiteindelijk heeft zijn werkgever de schade vergoed.

Het was vroeger nooit beter op crimineel gebied."
thenetherlands,Sinds dit jaar weer gedeeltelijk eigendom van de staat.
thenetherlands,"Haha, daarmee is het predicaat ouder dan het bedrijf zelf."
neoliberal,"There's also a parking garage in the ArenA itself, with a capacity of 2400. Costs like €25 during events though, so fans usually take the subway.

That's honestly the most baffling about so many US parking lots: the lack of multi-storey parking. It's more efficient use of space, easier to secure, protects against weather and you can choose to charge money for it."
neoliberal,"Not really. The surrounding area is filled with hot dog stands whenever there's an Ajax game, and fans often bring sixpacks of beer along."
soccer,"It makes the red card appealable, though. He may have played himself."
soccer,"Hij traint mee met de selectie, gap. Wanneer ik een baan bij de rechtbank krijg zetten ze me ook niet gelijk op de zaak Holleeder."
soccer,Songtekstreacties zijn eigenlijk best wel kut en niet zo veel toevoegend.
soccer,Consistently inconsistent. It seems to be related to the quality of the opponents.
soccer,"His involvement always comes across as ""I won't start it, but I _will_ end it""."
neoliberal,">Tottenham haven't won away **in the league** since February. 

This caveat gives me Nam flashbacks every time. 😭"
soccer,"I often like the experience of attending a match more than the actual football. It's why I recommend it to anyone, even those who hate the sport. You probably won't get a better taste of the local culture anywhere else."
AjaxAmsterdam,"Yeah, Article 15.4 says exactly that. Either 5 players or 6 players and officials."
soccer,"Mark van Bommel. Yet at the same time I kind of respect his commitment in being so utterly unlikeable towards fans of other clubs, both as a player and as coach."
soccer,I would like to thank Bert Kassies for hosting and consistently updating the most extensive UEFA coefficient ranking in the world for more than a decade on his personal homepage. What a guy.
soccer,A team that qualifies for the CL group stage gets 4 bonus points.
soccer,Doing every round of qualifiers will help.
soccer,"So I'm seeing a bunch of comments already about which site the goals are uploaded on, but that is really not the issue here. It's not streamable, streamja or whatever that is removing them, it's Reddit itself. They turn the thread into a self post without a link."
soccer,"Ajax had that issue too, so they started hosting the highlights on their own website. Maybe Feyenoord are doing the same."
soccer,"[UEFA calls them that, so probably.](https://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=52327/profile/index.html)"
soccer,They're not even at home. The roof collapsed in August so they're playing at ADO's ground.
soccer,"Tell that to the hordes of English scouts at De Toekomst and other Dutch academies. Coaches try to keep them at bay with spray bottles and rolled up newspapers, but they can't stop poaching."
thenetherlands,"Ja, dat was de enige partij die een daadwerkelijke wetsovertreding aanraadde. De andere suggesties zijn legaal."
soccer,The defense seriously needs to get carded less often.
neoliberal,"Ziyech's 0-1. He has like one goal from a distance every year, it's nice that it actually mattered this time."
neoliberal,">tfw not even the best GK of Slovenia

Charged, of course, but a bit tragic that such a minnow nation suddenly gets two fantastic goalkeepers."
neoliberal,">The ""cotton"" refers to underwear, implying that the contents of a trans woman's underwear (i.e., whether she has a penis) are of importance. The contents of her underwear act as an axis to oppress and marginalise her.

[Apparently](http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Cotton_ceiling)"
neoliberal,"Very cathartic highlights, not gonna lie."
soccer,"The main reason for this system is that there is no relegation from the second tier. There's technically a third tier, but teams from that league refuse to be promoted for various reasons. So they resort to these kinds of solutions to keep the league competitive for the bottom half."
neoliberal,">also, why do you hate the global underdogs ? 

After last CL semifinal I came to the conclusion that it's the hope that kills you. 😔"
neoliberal,"!ping SOCCER 

A hot take inspired by watching FC Groningen time waste for 70 minutes against Ajax: there should be a shot clock for every time play resumes. Think free kicks, throw ins, goal kicks and corners."
neoliberal,"This is the Daily Mail we're talking about, I'm frankly surprised they mention there will be a disruption at all."
soccer,Stopped the bus carrying the players home after PSV away and physically assaulted him.
soccer,"Bit rich there, given what the F-Side did to Ziyech two years ago."
soccer,"It has to be an active pass to cancel offside, so no deflections."
soccer,"Valencia. Though it's probably because I had a phase where I got so tired of the Messi-Ronaldo debate that I picked the third best Spanish team at the time.

Pretty excited for the CL matchup, to be honest."
soccer,Played 70 minutes against Fortuna on Wednesday but still needs match form.
soccer,"_KC and the Sunshine Band playing in the background_

Definitely good news. Means a January transfer is pretty much not happening."
soccer,"I'm getting ""US Presidential Election Campaign"" vibes from it."
soccer,"Watches can go for a lot, especially the top brands from Switzerland and the like. At that point it's jewellery with an added utility. They're also handmade (so steep production costs) and don't really deprecate in value like usual goods do, so many buy them as investment."
SubredditDrama,"Well, yeah. They're as serious as some people take this website. If they weren't, they'd get tons of unironic ""You committed the ultimate cardinal sin, you got personal""-tier outrage copypastas."
thenetherlands,Is er een Wish-versie van /r/disneyvacation?
AjaxAmsterdam,Wonder if there's anything planned around Fernando Ricksen. His funeral is today and Fortuna is obviously relevant to him.
neoliberal,"Without looking: shitheads started to talk about Greta Thunberg being on the spectrum, didn't they?"
neoliberal,"I can give you De Ligt, even as a loyal Ajax season ticket holder. But De Jong deserves to be on there, he was vital for the CL campaign and a revelation for the national team."
neoliberal,"!ping SOCCER

In my opinion there's very limited merit in individual awards for players in a team sport, but there really are some incredible stinkers in the FIFA awards tonight.

I mean, _Marcelo_ in the World 11? The man isn't even sure to start anymore."
neoliberal,"And yet he's in the FIFA XI, lmao."
AjaxAmsterdam,">red shorts

0/10 would not associate with"
neoliberal,Tagliafico is at least a top 3 LB.
AjaxAmsterdam,"The KNVB planned the really difficult or otherwise problematic Eredivisie matches in the same week as the European matches. We just had PSV away, De Klassieker is right after Ajax-Chelsea, there's matches against FC Utrecht and ADO (and we all know how they think about Ajax) and they play AZ away right after Valencia at home. 


Probably deliberate planning, since the majority of opponents play in Europe as well, but still. Makes those weeks a bit too stacked, imo."
AjaxAmsterdam,"This was kind of a shit match, if I'm honest."
soccer,"This was a real custom once, men were not allowed to be in the room unless they were a doctor.

This was in like the 1950s though."
soccer,He might not even have bought it. Hublot is a sponsor of Ajax and sponsors tend to give those kinds of gifts.
soccer,What was he even trying to do?
soccer,"High profile matches aren't really a target for match fixing anymore, and they also aren't fixing goals or winners for the most part. Those are too risky, too many people watching and the players are hard to convince. Instead they bet on things like the first team to get a throw in, in a match between two clubs in the Czech third tier or something"
soccer,Ik maak een verwijzing naar De Lullo's.
