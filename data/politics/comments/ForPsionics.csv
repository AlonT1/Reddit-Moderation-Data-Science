AntifascistsofReddit,"I had this at my dept. of the school library and figured ya'll might like this. It seems right in the wheelhouse of what we do.

Basically, some context is that the Nazi's in the 40's tried to co-op ben franklin by fabricating this speech written in a journal that was never found where franklin supposedly discussed the invasion of the Jews into america. Obviously such claims are ludicrous, but the intention was to connect their anti-semitic and racist movement into major historical figures in an attempt to give them some credence. 

Despite it being debunked at the time, it is still sometimes circulated in fascist circles as supporting evidence for their Big Lie."

politics,"Yeah thats a good point, I think its important to hammer home the idea that there needs to be multidimensional approaches to these sorts of things.

I think at the end of the day, then, it seems to be about **structure,** and how it manifests in the appropriate power relations."
politics,"This is a really good point and undercuts the really important thing about terrorist groups:  


**They don't necessarily exist because of a charismatic leader because their existence greatly depends on social and material inadequacies happening in that geographical context.**

If they do not get the necessary reforms, changes, or whatever to their situation, things may temporarily die down but in the long run someone else will pop up again... and again... and again.

And this isn't to necessarily undercut the work that is done to oust these dangerous leaders, who no doubt have massive influence and presence causing these organizations to prosper. That is indeed notable and potentially a step in the right direction if you define killing the powerful individual as such. However, similar to how a company continues to run if the CEO dies, ISIS as an organization will not simply fade away if the leader is killed but nothing is done to address the organization and its roots themselves.

LeftChat,"Important part of the article:

\[Mobilization is highly effective, at least according to corporate managers. Politicians and journalists focus on campaign contributions as the main way that companies influence government. But managers responding to my survey of employers reported that mobilization of workers was about as effective in changing public policy as hiring lobbyists, and that mobilization was even more effective than contributing to political action committees, buying campaign ads, and participating in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Employee mobilization appears to be complementary to these other activities. Companies that reported more traditional political activities such as lobbying or donating to candidates were much more likely to report engaging in worker mobilization compared to less politically active firms.\]"

DebateAnAtheist,This is... a comprehensive and awesome response. Thank you!!!!
DebateAnAtheist,"A really good book about the topic of frameworks of individual's viewpoints of reality is Herbert Marcuse's [One-dimensional Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Dimensional_Man)

In this book, he describes how people interpret information through 'one-dimensional thought', a phrase that we would probably attach to the phrase 'mental gymnastics', because it's used in the context of how all information taken in(whether it be about your life, capitalism, or religion) is either repelled or engulfed by the thought itself, and therefore powerless to change the mind in the first place.

In essence, even if you present what you think is contradicting information to the opposing viewpoint, they define it in the terms of their viewpoint, thus reducing the information to a level that can be absorbed into it(take, for example, the theists who claim that facts contrary to the bible are 'god testing them').

It's a little off topic to the 'choice of believing' but I think that if you consider that people's frameworks of how the world works can be so concrete that they interpret essentially everything through that lens, it's easy to pretend you have a 'choice' in belief since they would classify the beliefs they choose as not being the fundamental one that rests under all more complex and developed beliefs."
DebateAnAtheist,"I think people feel like they have a 'choice in what they believe' because they underestimate the foundations for their actual beliefs. For instance, new evidence shown for something you haven't done a lot of research about can seem like a 'choice' in what you believe about that topic, but it's really about how embedded the foundations of your beliefs are.

It seems that people are describing their beliefs and knowledge through the framework of choice when in reality it's about exposure and convincing, rational or otherwise."
DebateAnAtheist,"OP, I realize that you are asking a question, but I need you to contribute to the discussion yourself. This is a debate subreddit, not a simple Q&A one, so even though this may not be your argument, I would like you to contribute constructive content in the future.

DebateAnAtheist,"No you should definetely not just ask friends and/or family, that would be a worse sample size than any subreddit. What i mean is possibly more in the vein of broadening samples beyond the internet, potentially finding perhaps forums or alternative sites other than reddit.

DebateAnAtheist,"I think theres an interesting way to interpret the questions where you ask about what I ""agree about God""

&#x200B;

The thing is, is that while I am an atheist, I also agree that there are some common understandings of what god even is, and so i could potentially interpret the question to mean how I understand the colloquial sense of god to be... is.

&#x200B;

I suggest that maybe a better rephrasing of the question, if this was the real intention, would be to be more specific about whether you want people to report it as what they believe to be true, vs. what they believe the topic or concept to be about regardless of truth.

DebateAnAtheist,"I got in a conversation with one of my friends about it, and after she learned about my stance on the matter we got into a conversation about science. Throughout the conversation, she consistently asked things about science in the phrases of ""But do you believe that God did science/put the evidence there/some other variation of the phrase..."" and I thought it was interesting that she had such a one-dimensional way of looking at things, as in viewing it purely through the mind of a theist. I guess it was the time that I learned there really are differences in the frameworks that different people have especially considering the realm of religion.

DebateAnAtheist,Rules for those who can't easily view the sidebar.
DebateAnAtheist," **Stay on topic!**

The primary goal of the subreddit is to present a side of an argument related to atheism, although other semi-related topics are allowed as well as long as you specify your claims.

Try not to get too off-topic to the material you present, nor rambling about something unrelated to what your main argument is. Rather, try to stay close to the core of the thing you want to present.

(Examples and hypotheticals are okay, of course, as long as they are related to the core argument.)

&#x200B;

   
**Low commitment to the post**

Because this is a debate subreddit and not a ""please give us your youtube video"" subreddit, we would appreciate if you took the time and effort to write out your own argument, if at the very least primarily your own content.

In addition, don't just post a thread and wait a day for responses to fill up. Expect there to be responses early and frequently, and allot time for yourself to commit to the discussion you started.

Finally, make sure that your posts aren't shallow or too brief.

&#x200B;

 **Blatantly Obvious Trolling**

Note that because of the nature of the subreddit, we get many trolls trying to provoke people and disregard open and honest discussion. If you want to avoid this pitfall, some advice you could take is:

\-Don't preach without listening and responding to at least some criticisms or comments! -Don't pretend that things are self-evident truths! -Don't blame people for ""closing themselves to god"" or some other form of that phrase!

Note that we can usually tell if you're just trolling on purpose.

&#x200B;

 **Don't over-complicate meanings of atheism**

Please note that 'atheist' is an umbrella term that could consist of many different nuanced viewpoints, and that we do not all have exactly the same views about things. Things go smoother if you try to establish your claims yourself, rather than making blanket statements about the community.

If you would like to clarify what we mean by 'atheism', PLEASE do some research through the sidebar, or simply ask the chat, or pose a question. Do not assert that your Stanford Encyclopedia is correct.

&#x200B;

 **No 'Real' Rules**

We want to allow free and open discussion in good faith about the topic of whether gods exist, or perhaps the truth of other 'supernatural' claims as well, and how to develop convincing arguments and data-collection to justify beliefs of claims. There is a subjective 'meta' balance that is hard to define and difficult to cultivate. Be nice, be mean, be pithy, be snarky, use reason or mocking. But if you go beyond these meta-boundaries, repercussions may fall swiftly.

&#x200B;

 **Be Respectful**

We get that discussions of this nature can be frustrating or aggravating at times, but please remember that we are here to discuss content, not so much discussing whether somone's mother is of a certain quality.

We understand if you need to vent frustration, but if that takes over the discussion, you are not obligated to continue responding. You can take a break from at least that specific conversation if you feel like you need to cool or calm down."
DebateAnAtheist,"Does anyone think there is a connection between class and religion? If so, what are those connections? If not, where can we find trends of religiosity?"
NuNationalism,"First post, wanted to start small but at least add some content \^\^"
DebateAnAtheist,"Because the US in particular has such a Christian dense history, I wouldn't be surprised that the 'Christian worldview' has a major effect on it's culture regardless of what you actually identify as. For instance, people in Japan are affected by and institute AND romantisize christian marriages: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/43686902?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43686902?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what's exactly meant by 'christian worldview', but I'm assuming that it means ""the beliefs and practices that Christianity perpetuated"". By this definition, I have no problem in saying that it had a link in P much anywhere christianity was prevalent to any capacity. For instance, the value of Marriage, American capitalism, and Individualism all stem from major Christian/Protestant (in particular) beliefs(I would say so, anyway). 

&#x200B;

All of this, however, of course precludes the fact that Protestantism and Christianity as a whole merely adopted these values as important when they first surfaced. They did not 'invent' these concepts, more that they found them appropriate for the specific religion and emphasized them: [https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/morality\_evolved\_first\_long\_before\_religion/](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/morality_evolved_first_long_before_religion/)

&#x200B;

So I would say that if you live around a lot of Christians in a place that tends to promote Christianity, no matter who you are it just makes sense that you would learn those values anyway regardless of your belief in deities or whatever. You would learn what the people around you value and even if you may not think it's god instituting them, you still practice them for the purpose of social cohesion. 

&#x200B;

It's too simplistic to talk about the ""X worldview"" because there really isn't a tangible one, so I hope this answer helped out."
DebateAnAtheist,"I think its a combination of mental illness awareness like BBBBD says in his comment, and also a decrease in the social and emotional satisfaction that religion can give you. 

With suicide rates rising in the US: [https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/) I think the question must be begged about what is happening here in particular? Why are so many people unable to grip with the stress of reality?

Personally I think it has something to do with how people are finally starting to 'wake up' to a capacity, particularly in the US, due to the rising prevalence of news being about white supremacy, islam extremists, the catholic church's pedophilia, etc. All social issues that seem to have ties with religion.

This combined with our constant improving in science and knowledge results in a decrease of the credibility that religion used to have in olden times. Nowadays, people are looking to it less and less for guidance about basically anything except for personal strife.

&#x200B;

As for solutions, I think part of it has to do with A) how the media portrays problems and primes people to latch onto easily attention-grabbing stories in lieu of actual critical thought, causing them to accept blindly narratives, particularly in politics, and pushing away any semblance of honest discussion, and B) our education system, especially certain schools that tend to have semblances of authoritarian values due to the 'common core' education that we have to cohere to. 

&#x200B;

It's unfortunate that because we try to make education consistent it results in more and more people being left on the fringe of what they truly want to do because it's not what the 'system wants'. I personally am trying to research more about this, but I think part of the solution is Reforming our crime system, making it more about rehab instead of punishment, Reforming our education system, making it more about self improvement and critical thought(especially in early education) and less about memorizing the answers to pass the test, and Reforming american capitalism, in an attempt to neutralize the benefits that news and other forms of media gain from romantisizing and exemplifying problems beyond the discourse of reasonableness."

DebateAnAtheist,"Being raised without religion, it was very interesting to learn that people really did take their own religions very seriously. I suppose it was weird for me to learn about this because my default view is skepticism and a lack of belief in the supernatural realm, but I also think its very interesting to listen to other people's accounts to hopefully find some sort of information about this topic!

I very much enjoy reading everyone's contributions, even though I tend to be the least active mod around town."
sociology,"I'm wondering what the long-term implications are of this, and I think it would be good to possibly interview someone who understands living in that system, who subsequently moved to somewhere else more freer such as america, so that we can truly understand the standpoint within each social system. I suppose theres some sort of super-structural aspect to the Chinese government, and to me it seems like a regression to enforced solidarity, rather than the individualism that more liberal countries are instituting in the modern age.

&#x200B;

What's very interesting, of course, is the fact that they are essentially able to use modern up-to-date technology to achieve something that could previously only been done in small towns: forced assimilation within the country and cohesive conformity. The scale that this is being done is both scary and impressive, in my eyes."
DebateAnAtheist,Haha does that make me the student? I like that title.
DebateAnAtheist,"I suppose it's in the vein of reasoning that even if god does exist, he doesn't seem to care a tiny bit about whether I believe he does or not. So my position is that people shouldn't use god to justify behavior, simply because of how messy it is in practice. For instance, if someone tells me to do something or think a certain way because ""it's gods will"" or whatever, I don't see any situation where I can accept that as reasonable grounds for any reasonable decision.

&#x200B;

So i guess it could be encapsulated as ""I don't care, and you shouldn't either! You should decide for yourself instead."""

DebateAnAtheist,"Because even if there is a god, it doesn't seem to matter in the slightest. I'd probably define my self as more ""anti-organized religion"" if I'm being honest.   


However, it's important to me that people do not use god as their main justification for actions, because that is a folly. The best theists have is deism, things attributed to god have not had sufficient evidence to be stated that they actually are. I reject justification for action if they say it's god driven."

DebateAnAtheist,"The thing I think happens is that when indoctrinated in a religion, they are taught that their religion is the primary/only way to get group cohesion. It is fairly easy to say ""oh youre a christian im a christian lets get along!"" 

The problem I have with this is that this also separates them from other groups of religions, since they believe that they are all wrong. They sacrifice understanding and cooperation for limited cohesion that only works as long as the other people contribute.

So to answer the question, I think raising the kids as christian is for easy cohesion with a group rather than doing the work to create meaningful bonds, teaching the kids that christian == them and other == not them is a foolish endeavor  to try to easily make them work instead of teaching them to socialize well. "
DebateAnAtheist,"The way i see it theres a difference between ‘insulated’ and ‘being aware but not connected to’. It sounds like to me that your friend thinks that if a non religious person doesnt want to raise their kid as christian that somehow means that theyre anti-christian, which is not necessarily true. 

Another thing that i think is funny is that your friend sounds like hes talking about atheists with the subject of ‘specific prejudices’ and ‘insulation’, when it really is religions that do this the most. "
DebateAnAtheist,"Science is more than how much you know. Science is the process of understanding the evidence to point towards what seems to be true. How much humans know due to science is completely irrelevant to the facets of the reasoning and testing that science uses to understand reality, and in fact is a testament to how reliable science can be, with so many people making so many unfounded claims.

&#x200B;

I don't really get what you mean by 'humility'. When we don't know something, we don't claim to know the answer, unlike religion. This on its own is quite humble compared to religion's constant assertions that they know what causes what but being unable to justify their claims. "

One really important thing that I learned growing up was the ability to think/do things for myself. A lot of schools give you tasks without really understanding why those tasks are done, which is what I feel like happens to a lot of people and why motivation is not as high there. Instead of being cookie cutter classes, you should focus on the student(child) and promote curiosity and question asking, with you more as the guide and less as the teacher.

It may be easy to fall into the pitfall of doing everything for them, since they're at the house and you're the parent. DON'T DO THIS! Kids are much more capable at younger ages than we think they are, and it's a really good way of character and personal growth and maturity when they do things for themselves. This includes:

-- Creating a proficiency with researching information, such as dictionary, encyclopedia, wikipedia, internet familiarity

-- Involving them in the consequence region, such as adknowledging misbehavior, understanding why they do it, making sure they understand when it is and isn't okay, and allowing them to contribute to the house rules that everyone abides by

-- THEY CAN LEARN TO READ MUCH FASTER THAN YOU THINK! One kid(5) in the summer camp this year wasn't homeschooled, but before 5 they might as well be. One really really important thing in the TV infested society we live in is SUBTITLES!!!! Kids associating the words with the sound before they can even speak words jumpstarts their reading and can singlehandedly put them miles ahead of other kids in school their age. Of course, you can supplement this with handwriting practice, flash cards of their favorite subject and the names of stuff, and being enthusiastic about learning new words.

-- Uhh, what else? Find groups of homeschoolers around you! Just because they aren't in school doesn't mean they don't want to socialize with people, just the opposite. Personally, I'm incredibly outgoing and social contrary to the stereotype of the culturally averse homeschooler, and that's due to many park days with homeschooling groups. Try to find a group that works for you, because depending on the area you live in you may have many groups to choose from or none at all.

-- On the off chance there are none at all, there is nothing wrong with putting them in extracurricular classes and clubs. This may in fact be their only form of making friends if you can't find a stable friend group, but that may or may not be secondary to the value of getting teaching from someone thats not you.

--Uhh, I'm running out of things from my own life. I guess the last thing is to create as many open pathways as possible to choose from, and encourage them to dive in to the one that interests them. We don't find people who are bland and only talk about the weather interesting, we want to be around people who are uber-enthusiastic about their work. On the flip side, they may not get as much social pressure to conform being outside of school, so also make sure to teach them about social awareness. 

--Oh, sex ed! It's likely they will get it from the internet whether you tell them or not, so WHEN ITS THE APPROPRIATE TIME it's better to just be candid and unshameful as possible. My learning of it from my parents lasted about 10 minutes, and I unfortunately got a lot of my learning about it from the internet, but I was lucky to be born a boy. A girl growing up would naturally be more curious about her body because of the obvious growing changes in contrast to a boy(like me) who had no real change other than smelling worse and random boners(lol). Just be open and honest and don't belittle their questions(though this is true for everything really, not just sex ed) and you should be fine for the most part.

-- And have fun! You have your kid around the house all the time and once they leave for college youll have prepared them to rock the world. Create relationships that they value rather than just being an emotionless rock. It sounds obvious but after 3 years of changing diapers and all that jazz it can be tiresome. It's fine, it seems like a long time but time only goes for so long.

I hope this helped, and good luck!

You can talk to him, but he never seems to talk back. Not really sure how talking to jesus and expecting someone else to fix your problems is more effective than actually going out and fixing your problems."

DebateAnAtheist,"An argument is not evidence. Evidence is used to support an argument.

Dude, you're misunderstanding most of our stances. We reject the proposition that a God exists. We have not been provided sufficient evidence for the claim a God exists, so we don't live our lives with that assumption.

You think we have proof that God doesn't exist? I certainly don't. I can't just show you ""heres a thing"" and then you say ""wellp that means god doesnt exist"". No! It's not about whether I can prove the nonexistence of something. 

*You* need to prove to *me* that my default stance of a Godless life is *wrong*. NOT the other way around."
DebateAnAtheist,"How the hell do you prove something without evidence?

Also, all the responses to your original comment show why your reasoning is flawed. I'd suggest you respond to them as well with these responses and see if the opinion differs."
DebateAnAtheist,">Then we could just switch it to a god that doesn’t interact. The atheistic argument would need to refute both of these types of god.

YOU presented this idea. However, I can see that you didn't CLAIM that this is the case, just that we need to refute it. So my bad on that end. Also, I realize that religions wouldn't necessarily be disproven, but that with the non-interventionist model, they have absolutely no basis on defining or describing aspects of a god. If they have no basis for this, I don't see why I have to accept that God even exists regardless of how non-interventionist he is.

However, this is not how atheism works(at least for me). I have not been convinced that a God exists based on any occurrences in my life nor arguments presented to me, therefore I cannot in my right mind start with the assumption that a God exists. 

What's your point, anyway? A truly non-interventionist god would be equally provable and unprovable because by definition it wouldn't tangibly affect the world? That's not even true because God created the universe, right? *How can this be demonstrated?* "

politics,"It's not so much as what has been removed as the general sentiment. America is such a powerhouse on the global scale that those third world countries that you mention look at the US and see how prominent members of our society do not believe in climate change.(Edit: spelling)

In California, we recently voted on a Prop that prohibits the sale of livestock from animals that are not within a set of conditions allowing them to stand, lay down, etc. within their cages. This applies to any manufacturer trying to sell things to California, and because it itself is such an economic powerhouse in the US, it will (hopefully) cause many sellers to follow suit as selling to CA is in such high demand.

Similarly, I am in favor of the idea that to import things to America, the places that produce those things imported here must be manufactured in similar instances of American laws and regulations. We don't necessarily have to modify the laws and regulations of any other country than Americas, but instead create a set of guidelines that those countries must abide by in order to sell to us, as our trade is one large facet of our country. 

In essence, we wouldn't do anything directly to them. Instead, we would focus on the quality control of the products imported here and the conditions of the products developed imported here to determine what is legal importation or not. By setting our standards, countries depending on our outsourcing of goods and products will either choose to follow suit, or cease selling to the US."
DebateAnAtheist,So how do you know that a God exists?
politics,"Who has stopped trying?! We have people in office RIGHT NOW that refuse to believe that climate change is a thing and refusing to support the orginizations that are trying to combat it.

Honestly I'm not too sure about that regard, so I will withhold that point.

You were talking about the U.S. and it's carbon emmissions. However, you are disregarding the effect that the U.S. has on other countries. Even if your statistic about the U.S. carbon emission is true, you are not taking into account the AMERICAN OWNED factories in the previously stated third world countries. "
politics,"So what? So since were ""the best"" we should just stop trying to improve our lives and future lives? We should not punish those accountable for taking advantage of the poor and middle class?

You do realize that many companies in the US outsource factory labor in third world countries, they dont build them here due to our legislative restrictions, so they manufacture US products out of the country. Why do you think most things you buy are ""made in china"", ""made in india"", etc."

There will still be pressure from those around you and suggested consequences for not joining religious functions. The best thing to do is take steps, secretly or otherwise, to keep busy and simply save up for yourself by focusing on bettering yourself *for the sake of* bettering yourself.

In addition, you then wouldn't mind the taxation of churches, right? After all, there shouldn't be a focus on material wealth therefore the tax should be meaningless since money is not the focus like you say.

""True"" christianity is just an ideal created to fool you into giving money to them. Just because the bible says something, doesn't mean that everyone will follow it. Do you also agree that everything in the bible about woman ownership and oppression should be followed? Slavery? Sexual assault? "
atheism,"It's because those things are 'unnatural' and taint the human soul or something. God forbid you divert the flow of nature with your atheist science! 

Honestly, it feels like just another thing to keep them indoctrinated. If they get medicated, theres a slight chance they'll leave the church. Better to have em die without medicine than live without religion, right?"
atheism,"I feel like it's precisely because it's never been done before that people idolize it. One of the things in my experience that religion teaches is the idea that we have limited thyme in this world, and thus we want to do as much service to god as possible before going to 'afterlife'. Therefore, you could say that it's linked to the 'calling', the moral service towards a god that you act with religious intent. Thus, eternal life seems ideal because then you'd have all the time in the world to A: promote your religion, B: perform god's duties, and C: act like a god yourself. Part of the reason why I'm atheist is especially reason C, not because I actually think that people act like gods, but because of the following question. If god is so benevolent, why are religious people overall offended and scandalized when someone tells them they don't believe? Instead of being accepting like god supposedly 'teaches', they seem to take it upon themselves to 'fix' me. I do not go around 'fixing' catholic or christian people on the street when I learn about them! This idea is ridiculous. 

So eternal life. I think people think they want it for the reasons stated above, especially because they can't understand the full repercussions of what it's REALLY about and what consequences would really happen if they achieved it. In addition, I view it as a desire to achieve something impossible by definition, and thus is irrational in basis. However, because of their blind belief in the 'supernatural', they tend not to think about the consequences and possible causes of eternal life, and thus romanticize it to an exaggerated extent.

At least, from my experience."
atheism,"Think of it this way:

Consider a child raised in a strict patriarchal household, where whatever the father says, goes. You grow up learning that your father is the nexus of all decisions made within the house, and thus you learn throughout your life that you need to do everything for him, and only then will you be sufficiently taken care of. If you do not take care of him, do what he says, etc. you will be dropped from his care without thought or empathy.

This type of household is anti-individualistic as the person in charge of your thoughts and intentions are not you yourself, like it should be(as who wants to say that they're controlled primarily by something else?) rather, you operate on the assumption that your father is the central figurehead. Why do you think this way? Because you don't know any other way to go about life. You were never taught otherwise.

Now consider a very liberal family where all thoughts and ideas are mutually communicated effectively and equally. Neither parent establishes themselves as ""always correct"", morally just, or final judges on any topic. Rather, they are simply there to support you but stand back to allow you to make your own decisions based on the details of the world you live in, and they give you advice based on that context >without< telling you what to do specifically.

This type of household seems to be more individualistic because there's more focus on your thoughts and motivations for yourself, in contrast of doing them for the purpose of pleasing some 'higher power'. Notably, while there are your parents, giving you advice, there are no repercussions(from said parents) in rejecting that advice and finding out the consequences for yourself. Then, after you experience those consequences, you see that the parents were either right or wrong depending on the situation, and thus you have effectively established the scientific method(as you have attempted the concept of repeatability for experiments). 

This is how I view the differences between what I grew up with and what some fundamental religious people grew up with. Because of the sheer number of denominations of belief, I can't just lump all of them in one group, but the idea still stands as such: Why is it that there has to be a top of the pyramid, the ruler of all beings, that I have to constantly appease and think about every day? Why are there set arbitrary punishments for beliefs and actions I myself do not think are morally wrong? I would rather go throughout the day accepting that the responsibility of my actions are mine and mine alone, rather than being in the context of god, thus applying judgment of myself *only* to myself. 

Then, of course, this wraps back to science as an authority. When you understand the fundamentals of experimentation and repeatability, you can rationally think about cause and effect without the cloud of judgment that some book or some preacher arbitrarily said to you. If you pretend that you were never exposed to a religion, it's not guaranteed that you would inherently know that there must be a higher power. Treating science as a higher power is a folly, because it's not a higher power. Rather, science is a process for rational belief. Using this process, I have gone throughout my life using the scientific method constantly to make my own judgments for myself, without anyone trying to dictate my core values or ideas. I feel like I have more freedom here than anyone within any religion."
atheism,"How similar is the Christian bible to the Qur'an? 

Are they treated functionally as the same document, or do they have different purposes?"

atheism,"Thanks for the well thought-out response. You would think that a book written hundreds of years ago would be considered outdated by the masses, but it surprises me just how many people still take it seriously to an extent I'm uncomfortable with.

atheism,"So im curious about this: What use does the bible have, if at all?

Should it always be taken literally, always be taken metaphorically, etc.

Do you think the stories are true, or just an interpretation of something else that happened?"

* It clashes with glimmer for the T4 play
* I was never happy with bouncing their creatures, they has ETB effects they would benefit from again
* After playing it a couple times, it was fairly easy for the opponent to play around it. Especially if they're aggro.

These 3 reasons were why i went down to 2 Engulfs, then cut them entirely. I had a much better performance with 1 for 1 removal and card advantage and the mass bounce was out of place."
politics,"To the dominating group, equality looks like oppression. "
magicTCG,Profit
magicTCG,Yes.
magicTCG,"I've been testing the cycle lands, and they definitely make playing more lands in the deck easier. In a monocolor deck alone, you can potentially play 29 lands, for instance, because 8 of them cantrip away creating 21 lands at the very least. Beyond one color, the possibilities only multiply from there.

In regards to the hieroglyphics, I'm still not sure if it's good. I definitely agree that it's not as good as glimmer and can't replace it, but replacing anticipate instead is something I didn't think of. I need to test that."
magicTCG,"IMO the main problem is that most of the posts say more or less the same thing and stating the obvious: that most of the cards aren't good in modern. 

This is true, and the reasons he's stating are probably also true, but it gets old really fast and he's not really adding a lot of substance to the new cards coming out. "
magicTCG,"I've always been a fan of lands with abilities, and I'm currently using spawning bed in my control deck. This kind of card is much more powerful than it looks, and while this card is less resilient than spawning bed, the fact that later in the game you basically draw a creature insead of a land is a really good upside.

magicTCG,Looking forward to testing pull from tomorrow a whole bunch in my mono blue deck. Why yes i will take this lategame card thats instant speed
spikes,"Right, a lot of the time I leave up 4 mana instead of dealing with 2 creatures and it just is enough to kill me and not be good for me to engulf. I was never happy drawing it so it leaked out of my 75."
spikes,"The main problem I kept coming across with engulf is that a) it didn't provide card advantage, just tempo advantage. Also, its not that great when people play stuff postcombat and b) a LOT of things in standard right now benefit from being bounced, just to name a few: Felidar Sovereign, Whirler Virtuoso, Walking Ballista, Rogue Refiner, Ishkanah, and many more. 

I simply wasn't happy with resetting my opponent's board, because they could just rebuild it pretty quickly. Especially against aggro decks. Because of this, and the reprint of essence scatter, I have found that engulf is simply not needed in this deck anymore. It already deals with board creatures fairly well."
spikes,"Okay! Heres the current list: [Mono U Hulk Flash](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mono-blue-hulk-flash/)

Basically you nerf their threats or counter them, and accrue card advantage otherwise. The worst matchup is aggro, of course, so I'm trying really hard to put things in the sideboard that work well. I'm hoping that some good defensive card comes out soon that I can use to stymie aggressive strategies."
spikes,"In standard, I want to continue testing the cycle lands and the curator of mysteries to hopefully create a viable mono blue control deck. 

In modern, i want to play as foretold with 4x restore balance and 4x ancestral vision, also a control deck. Im still working on the kinks for that one. "
magicTCG,"I'm still trying to figure out a way to consistently beat the aggro decks. Although the matchup is lopsided I recently found that adding Aether Meltdown and Spontaneous Mutation really help in trying to survive to get to a hulk or two to counter the oncoming ballistas and such. 

In addition, I'm trying to find good sideboard cards that I can use for the aggro matchup, such as lifegain or cheap removal perhaps. Mono blue naturally doesn't have a lot of hard removal, but the enchantments do help and I'm basically hoping some niche common in amonkhet will prove to be playable in my list."
magicTCG,"Been testing curator of mysteries in my mono blue control deck: It's very good at filling the slot for 1 mana and the slot for a nice topdeck in the late game. In addition, cycling it away early fuels my spontaneous mutations, and having one out with 8 cycle lands lead for very consistent draws. "
iamverysmart,"He's wrong anyway, rainbows are made when a unicorn barfs."
magicTCG,"I look forward to countering gearhulks for 2 mana, that's for sure."
magicTCG,"I feel like archaeonancer is better because while it costs more upfront, the fact that you still get your thing back regardless of if it gets killed or not is really nice. In addition, you din't have to wait a turn before getting back your spell, and finally you dont have to get rid of your creature to get it back. 

The extra power and lower upfront cost doesn't make up for it. "
magicTCG,"Oblivion ring with cycling? I like it. 

I feel like theres at least a limited deck shaping up of a UW cycling deck."

* They simply are too expensive to be placed into a standard today, especially as using 5 mythic slots for them, or

* Wizards may want to create new and interesting effects to be paired with the god, assuming that the gods aren't just generic ""Blue makes you draw cards"" or ""Green gives you lands and huge creatures"".

Barring those, I would actually like a reprint of them, simply so I could play them in EDH. In addition, the return of cycling certainly makes it more likely that they would be reprinted. However, I personally don't think they are impactful enough to be using so many slots in the set/block for them."

Also, it could be good vs. marvel but again like you say negate is a more reliable slot for that because it also counters the planeswalkers in case they have them. 

It makes me a little sad because I was so happy to get a good 1 mana counterspell in standard but it's just too narrow to run. "
spikes,"It plays really well, except its weak points are against combo decks and really fast hands of aggro decks. However, the trick lies in the things in the sb that allow you to run your cheaper disruption given that trail is less good due to the cost. 

Making your land drops is extremely important in this deck. If you miss for one turn it can hurt a lot because your boardstate is nothing but lands.

magicTCG,I dig it. 
magicTCG,"I see where your coming from, and I agree that glimmer is great as an individual card. I think it's important to note that I'm not trying to say that I would rather not play glimmer at all, just that I like trail in addition to the glimmer. 

That being said, I probably have some bias because the deck I'm playing is essentially turbofog rather than an actual traditional control deck. 

Still, the mana cost is undeniably rough. I guess I tried to downplay it but it definetely is there, and to make it work I'm forced to play a specific deck rather than jamming it into a deck to make it better. Land drops are especially important and if I miss one it hurts way more than in regular control decks. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like trail has made me very happy with its performance, despite its obvious downsides, and it + glimmer have made me a happy camper in the card advantage department. "
magicTCG,"I personally have found that trail of evidence actually does better card draw than glimmer once you get past the playing of a 3 cost sorcery. Making every spell cantrip is way better than drawing 2 cards one time. 
"
spikes,"I can attest to that. I was never happy with intimations unless I was playing against a control deck, and that meant it just wasn't feasable in a format where vehicles and bg counters are decks. "
spikes,"I agree that key is very good in regular improvise decks, given that T2 key into T3 touch can be devastating against certain decks and the added random card draw without having to discard. However, Map is one of the best 1 mana artifacts you can play in this deck that allow you to play rebuke on turn 3 semi-reliably, and it also can count as one of the lands in the manabase's slots. 

However, this isn't improvise, so I don't know if key is as good here as it could be in other more-improvisational decks. I only see 4 cards that combo with the key, and tezz touch just makes it die to stuff anyway(even though you get key back, it's not amazing.)

I feel like if you wanted to play Key to the city, you could probably get away with 1 in the main, possibly removing some high-costing threat like Master, Ob nixilis, or a Tezz, because that would make the deck more controlling. Also, you could more easily put some in the board for matchups where the card advantage matters, or you need to get in for damage in stalemates. 

Anyway, that's my .02c.  "
spikes,"[Mono Blue Metallurgic!](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mono-blue-metallurgic-4/)

I've been rocking this deck in the wake of my failed Dark Intimations build after realizing that I was never happy with the manabase of grixis. So instead, I decided to go mono blue and proceeded to go 2-1 split at the latest standard tournament at my LGS. It basically plays like a turbo-fog deck and wins with Metallurgic Summonings while getting extreme card advantage with Trail of Evidence."
magicTCG,"In the same vein, I also found Japanese cards to have a different production value. They're more glossy and bend slightly different. "

spikes,"To be fair, drawing a card as well makes it a 3 for 1 very commonly. 

But yeah, I was considering TTS and it makes sense for it to be in that slot instead of DI. After all, it's cheaper and it's instant speed which is a plus with the Gearhulk. 

However, I also have been finding DI a good way to continue the game in my favor. While it doesn't outright win the game, like with Cruel ultimatum, I find myself liking the part of the card that ekes out a little more card advantage off of the thing it kills. 

I will admit, however, that setting up for a truly devastating DI can be difficult if you don't draw enough removal. 

The main part of this card I wanted it to be is a way to kill the planeswalker or the solitary threat after controlling the board for a bit, and I never feel bad playing it because it draws me into more stuff. "
spikes,"And also you can gearhulk a shot, you can't reuse a stasis snare. "
magicTCG,"I've been trying a grixis control list, with a somewhat good amount of success. It uses Dark Intimations as a 4-of, in response to all of the crazy walkers in the format. I like how it performs against GB snek, Vehicles, and Control decks.

[List!](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/grixis-intimations-3/) if anyone's interested."
AskReddit,Fair enough. 
spikes,"Not OP but I'll give it a crack. 

Last night I went to a standard tournament with my grixis control deck in tow. The main problem I was running into is that every time I had it in hand, either I didn't have a good follow up for the ability, or I wanted to hold up a counter next turn, or the boardstate simply wasn't threatening enough/I couldn't kill their creatures. 

I kept finding that it was a lot of mana for an effect that wasn't amazing to begin with. Each time, I would've rather had either one for one removal or card draw.

I feel like it's a good card, however, I don't think it's good enough against the meta to merit playing in the main deck. Rather, I would prefer maybe a two of in the SB for when heavy creature aggro decks are what my opponent is playing."

spikes,"I really think dark intimations and key to the city will see a lot more play.

 Dark intimations depends on whether bolas will be good or not, but even beyond that its a crazy good card advantage card thats fairly cheap to cast and kills planeswalkers. 

Key to the city depends on whether improvise will be actually good, and it even may see play with the new ensoul artifact. However it does so many things by itself. Enabling delirium and getting rid of useless lands to draw gas is very good for a control deck, and getting in past random tokens to kill a walker with a gearhulk or something is valuable as well."
