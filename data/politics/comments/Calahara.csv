ukpolitics,"With all due respect, people are really scared about what's happening. Maybe people have been nasty to you online, and I totally understand the feeling you'd want to be nasty now as revenge.

What I'd posit to you is - be better than them. Your side won, I have to respect that. What I believe you should do is calm us down, convince us we'll be okay. Remind us that you're not an 'other', you're a neighbour.

I'm willing to get along with you if you're willing to get along with me. Let's tackle the future together, as patriots in our own way. What do you say?"
ukpolitics,"Listen, there's nothing to be gained with this rhetoric. Nobody's anti-patriotic just because they voted Remain or Leave. We need to start getting along or we're going to make things worse for everyone.

His rationale was that he wasn't a senator at the time Mitch blocked Garland, so he didn't feel the precedent (which I guess he had disagreed with) impacted his position for Barrett.

AskALiberal,"Having something high-level on our side would be great, but in terms of what we as individuals can action, we have to work from the bottom. Conservative media is constantly at an advantage no matter who is in power. Until we have something to compete with that or some regulation against misinformation then this is all we got."
ukpolitics,Absolutely. I would say that dampening the spread of misinformation should be our top priority.
AskALiberal,"Dan Pfeiffer of Pod Save America was talking about this on a recent episode. Basically we need to start with the acknowledgement that there's a massive media machine and a mountain of misinformation against us, and we need to work from the ground up to get people and communities involved to combat it. Theirs is top-down; ours is bottom-up.

I realise it's not a direct answer to your question but I actually think this does solve it - essentially it's people believing the stupid shit that gives license for politicians to go with it. Take away the power of misinformation and you stop bad faith actors dead in their tracks."

SubredditDrama,"Well, I'm impressed. It still sounds absolutely barmy but I'm impressed.

Follow-up - what's the deal with the nobodies? The whole ending of KH2 was about Sora and Roxas coming together, thus making Sora whole, but then did they retcon it or something so that nobodies ended up having hearts?

So doesn't that make the whole of KH2 kinda pointless if Roxas could just exist on his own, and the Organisation members didn't need Kingdom Hearts to have hearts after all? Like... they could have just waited a bit?

Methinks a retcon is afoot."

ukpolitics,Thanks for saying that. It wasn't my intention to insinuate that people aren't doing bad things - I just wanted to know how they justified it to themselves.
ukpolitics,"Maybe, uh, take a few steps away from the window. Just in case."
ukpolitics,"So perhaps they see the damage, aren't good enough to stop it, and so are just trying to spin for self-preservation? That's certainly plausible."
ukpolitics,"So I guess that's a greater good argument then, where they see the damage as worth it for a supposed long-term gain according to their ideology. Hm, yeah, I can see that."
ukpolitics,"Thank you for responding in a much more friendly tone, and I see where you're coming from.

If I may ask a follow-up, then - let's go on the assumption that's it's true that people in government lack empathy. Why do we see so many of that type of person in these positions of power right now? The vast majority of people I know care about others, so I'm quite surprised - if it is indeed the case - that the current government includes a disproportionate number of people who aren't empathetic."
ukpolitics,"My question is exactly about feelings, yes. I know politicians lie, I know they cheat, I know the Tories are awful, I know Brexit sucks. I'm not asking about that. I'm asking how they see themselves. This question isn't about facts at all, and frankly everyone else who has responded to me seems to have understood what I'm getting at."
ukpolitics,"I think you've proved my point - you see yourself as the good guy in this conversation. You've justified being rude to me by saying I need to hear it.

So, how does Boris justify letting No Deal happen?"
ukpolitics,"I have to be honest, this was a pretty rude response, and you seem to have made the assumption that I would even so much as consider voting Conservative ever. I didn't reelect any of them - in fact I voted tactically against the Tories in 2019. So you can take that back for a start.

Look, here's my point. People, by and large, see themselves as the hero of their own story. You don't see yourself as the bad guy when you do something wrong, right? Most of us don't. 

Transpose that to politics. Boris and his lot, contemptible shower though they are, must see themselves as good people, and doing the right thing. I say that because that's what humans in general do; politicians aren't 'born different' in that regard.

So with that in mind, I want to know what in their heads is justifying this. Maybe they frame it as not particularly damaging for the circles they run in - rich fox hunting types. Maybe their ideology convinces them that a clean break is necessary for the UK. Maybe they ARE evil and they revel in our misery. But even the worst people I know aren't like that."
ukpolitics,"Make no mistake, I don't have any faith in the Tories to do anything good. I'm just trying to work out what *they* see it like. 

There are very few people, I believe, who are actually awful and malicious. And I don't think the Tories see themselves as the villains. But if they think they're doing the right thing, then how do they frame this?"
politics,How does CA look down ballot? Maybe the plan is to drive out Dem turnout in the hope that voters will vote blue all the way down.
ukpolitics,"So what you're saying is, it's not necessarily that they're bad people, more that they're not competent enough to get the right stuff done? That's plausible."
ukpolitics,"I want to ask an honest question.

How could they let this happen?

I know the cynical answers of ""tories don't care"" and ""they want to line their pockets"" are commonly thrown about, and there may well be merit to them, but a big part of me refuses to believe that they would be so callous.

They know this is going to be damaging, they know it's going to be a huge blow to basically everybody, and I wager they know it's going to lose them votes. Why can't they just work this out?

I believe that people are basically good. I don't think the government sits around laughing in a sinister way at all the misery it's going to cause. But surely they know what's going on."

Once that's done, it's time to make some proper progress with a new agenda, and that's where the 2024 candidate comes in."

PresidentialRaceMemes,"If after four years of a Trump presidency, with all that he's done and all that he's doing now, all you can do is simply say ""oh well"", then I despair. 

It's been absolutely awful watching all of this unfold from across the ocean and I'm even more terrified now than I was four years ago; I'm not even the person living this. Everything is worse for him being in power, and you have the chance to stop him and thwart his attempts at a literal rigged election. Surely you can see how fucking scary that is? A rigged election! This isn't about voting for someone, it's about stopping the worst President in history, and yes I'm including Buchanan in that."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"Ilhan Omar, not two weeks ago, won her primary against a well-funded establishment challenger. The change is possible even if it's an uphill battle.

As I said in my first comment, the two main candidates are Donald Trump, who's trying to prevent people from voting or having their votes counted by gutting the post office and trying to find ways to block late arrival ballots, and with four years of corruption that would make Nixon blush, or Joe Biden, who isn't that person. Literally any other election bar 2016 I would say vote for who you want, but this is far, far too important. The man simply must be stopped."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"But you don't have progressives controlling the party, that's what I was saying. Bernie did a good job moving the platform left, and AOC and co have proved pretty formidable. But that's kinda it, at least at that level.

It's not about easing any conscience. I've said this in other comments, this election needs to be a solid rebuke of Trump's horrible ideology and corruption. Because if he wins, all of that is validated by his supporters and enablers, and then you're really fucked. Realistically the next President is going to be from one of the two major parties, so the only way to heat Trump is to vote for the other viable option, which is Biden."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"I hate to say it, but if you needed lots of progressives in office to fix the climate now, then yeah, that sort of process should have started quite a long time ago. But since you don't, right now there's still one potential viable President better than the other on this issue, and it isn't Donald Trump, I think we can agree on that."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"Were the US not a two-party system, I'd suggest voting for a different party. But with the situation as it is, if your establishment Democrat isn't amenable to supporting a policy you find important, then you need to primary them and on top of that, do all you can to place progressives in the party wherever possible. That's your way forward."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"Well, I've made my case as best I can in my original comment. I'm a progressive myself, I even phonebanked for Bernie (legal as a foreigner as it turns out, definitely a loophole needing closed there). I'm not a neoliberal nor am I any sort of political science expert. But in a two-party system which stifles third parties the change clearly has to come from within, and that's why I advocate this position. 

By that same token, I think the current President is too dangerous and I'm incredibly worried that a split on our side of the aisle is going to cause him being re-elected. Frankly, he's done too much damage for too long. We either rebuke his corruption and vile ideology or we validate it by him winning a second term."
PresidentialRaceMemes,I mean I didn't really expect anyone to argue against party reform being good so... ok?
PresidentialRaceMemes,"I'm not sure where we're having trouble here. Electing progressives makes the party more progressive. If you're talking about big money getting in the way of a progressive then that's a challenge to overcome, yes. Ilhan Omar managed it not a couple of weeks ago. It can be done. And again, this wouldn't be the only place in the party where you would be pushing progressive policy and members."
PresidentialRaceMemes,So we agree. I'm not sure what the issue is.
PresidentialRaceMemes,"Yes, she is further left than the party itself. With more like her, the party would shift."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"Nice of you to tar me with that brush. But the answer is all of it - you need progressives active at every level to make a progressive party. And progressives do exist within the Dems - the Squad didn't get there on their own, they had voters and others working with them. If you want a Democratic Party you'd be happy voting for, that's what you have to do. I'm not an expert, it's just common sense."
PresidentialRaceMemes,I was talking about change within the party. The second paragraph in my original post outlines why a vote for Biden matters this time.
PresidentialRaceMemes,"I see where you're coming from. My reasoning is that, well, even if you didn't think Biden was the most viable to beat Trump out of the Dem candidates - and for the record I'm a Bernie supporter - he's now the (technically still presumptive) Dem nominee. I think everyone acknowledges that a third-party candidate isn't going to secure the Presidency against the two massive parties. So, in terms of the options available now, Biden \*is\* the only viable candidate to beat the incumbent.

I don't intend to hurt any feelings by saying that, and in any other election (except 2016 for the same reasons I'm outlining) I'd say vote however you want... but this threat, as I said above, is existential. Trump, his ideology, and his corruption need the strongest rebuke possible or every awful thing you've experienced so far gets validated in the eyes of his supporters and enablers, and it's going to get even worse."
PresidentialRaceMemes,"If you're not happy about this ticket, consider that change starts at a much lower level than this. To have a progressive party, there need to be a lot of progressives in office. To get them there, it's about voting for them in local elections, primaries. Start small and work up. I believe a progressive Democratic Party can exist, and I believe America can be made better for it.

But right now, there's an existential threat sitting in the White House and you guys need to get together and vote for the only viable candidate that can oust it. The current President's in the process of rigging the election, for god's sake. How much more motivation do you need?"

relationship_advice,"Wow, hello me at age 21! I'm 25 now and I could have written this post today.

So I'm pretty much exactly like you, only with a few 'relationshippy' experiences lasting a few weeks each under my belt. What I have learned is that there's a cycle to it - you become 'ok' with being alone, then you maybe meet someone and it feels amazing, then after it ends you realise you're not really ok with being alone after all and you were just pretending. But you try to make it work, get to a point maybe in a couple of years where you feel ok again... and then it repeats.

Maybe this isn't you, and if that's the case I apologise for projecting. But frankly I've decided I'm *not* ok with being single and as much as it bloody hurts I'm not going to pretend otherwise this time.

Now, advice. I think you're actually doing the right thing, which is what I'm doing too. As a general notion, anyone you end up with will want to see you as a catch, right? Getting a degree, a job, a stable life goes a long way. For me, I've started learning more complex dishes to cook, have taken up hiking, improved my diet, and have started decorating my home to look nice to visitors (because that's part of the overall impression).

So, basically I think you should keep doing what you're doing, because it makes you attractive to a potential partner. You can start trying to find one whenever you like of course, but if you want to retain the focus on your career, do that first! Single people still exist at age 25, fewer in number sure but all very lovely."

askaconservative,"Ah, thanks! Our hospitality is a point of a pride for us in some ways. It's been nice living here during the pandemic; I've taken up hillwalking as a socially-distant hobby and it's made me appreciate what we have at our doorstep.

I think Starmer has a really sincere shot at becoming PM if things keep going the way they are. He's been very effective at getting through Boris's bluster - 'forensic' is a word I've often seen bandied about and I have to say I agree. The guy was one of the country's foremost human rights lawyers, after all. Starmer pins Boris down and doesn't let him get away with showmanship. Even many conservatives concede on that point.

Corbyn wasn't popular (that's a whole other topic!), and for many, Starmer represents a return to the broad church that Labour was under Blair. You can see how the approval ratings have shifted to them being almost equal. I actually think he's a lot more to the left than people maybe give him credit for, but as with all things it's about optics.

Not to mention, by the time of the next election we'll have had a Tory government for 15 years, which is a long time to be in power. A lot of things have gotten worse, and we haven't even had Brexit yet (it's happened on paper but we're still following EU rules til the end of the year).

I genuinely think there's a good shot."
askaconservative,I'm sure we could spend a long time debating whether it's feasible or not. But I thought it important to clarify the position because it does seem to me that 'socialism' gets treated as a bit of a boogeyman when a) lot of people actually mean a social democracy which b) working models exist of (that's the aforementioned Nordic model).
askaconservative,"No, I'm from Scotland, which is actually somewhat closer to the Nordic model than perhaps a lot of people are aware of. However, I do spend a lot of time talking to Americans on the left through Reddit etc, so although I won't presume to know what everyone on that side of the aisle thinks, most of the folks I've chatted with like the Nordic model and definitely do not want a Venezuela situation."
askaconservative,"I'm sorry, I'm a liberal visitor, but I really need to address that last point. Nobody wants a Venezuela situation. If you want to know the vision that people who advocate for this want for the US, go look at any countries who use the Nordic model - Norway, Denmark, and so forth. Essentially you're looking at capitalism plus social benefits."

ukpolitics,"Look man, I'm not gonna offer my opinion on these three people holding signs you saw. I don't speak for them, and I certainly don't speak for any movement. I had a few observations about the messaging and composition of a rally I attended and that's all.

If you don't believe police brutality and disproportionate violence towards people of colour by law enforcement exists in America, after everything, then I don't think anything is going to change your mind. Let's not tire ourselves out with the debate."
ukpolitics,"Yeah but what I'm getting at is - well, two things there. Firstly BLM as an organisation does exist, fair enough, but there is a larger movement that doesn't necessarily align 100% with them. My second point would be that, like I said, the BLM movement here has a slightly different flavour which is a bit more local and (going by the rally I attended) focused on general racial prejudice as opposed to policing specifically, and by extension defunding. It's notable that the BLM rally in my city was organised by someone I know personally who isn't, as far as I know, a member of the organisation at all. I believe she did it under her own steam.

I do get what you're saying, because yes the BLM site absolutely does discuss police defunding so that is part of the organisation's goals. But for a *movement* so large and multi-national I'm not sure we can take that idea and assume it applies to all the people/countries participating."
ukpolitics,"I'm not sure I agree with that, as someone who went to a recent BLM rally to see what it was all about. The movement as it stands on this side of the pond is a more general anti-racism movement, and the speakers they had did talk about their experiences with racism (because it does of course exist everywhere).

I'm in Scotland, and for a fairly homogenous nation I would have thought the crowd was like... 30% non-white? Which does seem to suggest it's a fairly diverse group. 

Finally, although I did see one person with a 'defund the police' sign, as I said above, I think BLM here is more general than that. Unlike America where they quite rightly make that a focus, the UK does not have a police violence problem."

I'm from the UK, where our National Anthem is 'God Save the Queen'. Off the top of my head, that song spans a minor 6th interval. Doesn't go very low, doesn't go very high, which makes it pretty easy to sing by most people. 

Then we get to Star Spangled Banner. The range is just about TRIPLED. We're talking an octave and a half here. Some people can sing that range but damn if it ain't a stretch. You're then further limited by what key you can put it into. If you play it in Bb (as American Songwriter seems to allude to as a decent key for it), your poor citizens end up reaching for a high F! Basses and baritone 2s will struggle there, and conversely a the lowest note - the Bb - will prove a challenge for sopranos. 

It's a great tune, don't get me wrong, but if your anthem is a *challenge* to sing, then it's possibly not the most appropriate anthem. Not that I'm advocating it be changed, of course. It's just been a peeve of mine."

Of course I could be wrong on all these counts. But that's my train of thought."

cookingforbeginners,"Tomato soup is probably the easiest thing ever. Just put some things in a pot, mix it and let it cook for a bit, then get the hand blender and go to work on it. Easy as that! I usually sautee onions in mine but you can even skip that step.

Then you realise that you could put literally anything in there - peppers, veg, etc - and voila, even more new dishes.

And then! Well you discover you're not too far away from a tomato sauce for a pasta, so you can make that. And what's this? Why, you're only a packet of mince away from bolognaise! Some kidney beans and spices, that's chilli. Tuna pasta requires but one tin of the stuff.

So yeah, tomato soup is my two cents. You can go really far with minor changes thereafter!"

worldnews,"Not quite the story and not quite the reason - Starmer fired Long-Bailey for retweeting a video interview during which the interviewee put forward that Israeli secret services were training US police in brutal tactics, such as kneeling on necks. Despite the wealth of legit criticism you can throw the Israeli government's way, there's no evidence of that.

The Labour Party has been dogged with antisemitism accusations over the past few years, and part of Starmer's task was to win back trust on that issue. The firing may have seemed unnecessarily harsh but this was part of that strategy. Zero tolerance and all that.

Secondly, it also removes Long-Bailey, part of Labour's more... well, radical side maybe isn't the right term but you get what I mean. The Corbyn lot that proved pretty unpopular with the voting public.

Starmer and his wife are Jewish, but faith hasn't featured in his politics as far as I know. I think chiefly this move was to get the Jewish community back on side with Labour, and removing Long-Bailey from the shadow cabinet deals a blow to the hard left. Two birds one stone."

Not to mention that even if we did just simply open up (which we won't - we've already been informed of ongoing restrictions), you would have to add several weeks onto *that* for the effects to materalise. So you'd be looking at maybe... a month or more before that hypothetical peak?"

Morrowind also has spellmaking and enchanting - while you asked specifically about alchemy, those systems are similarly fun to experiment with.

Also to note, Oblivion's system isn't dissimilar to Morrowind. Skyrim is a little bit watered-down.

Finally, Miasmata I believe is very heavily into the whole 'collect and mix' thing, but I couldn't get into it myself."

Scotland,"Another issue is that even if you heard her reasons for going and decided ""ah yeah that's fair enough"", the damage is done in terms of the optics. 

I've been asking myself, though, whether a change in personnel would be helpful during what is, by all accounts, the critical two weeks (at least) in flattening the curve. I don't know Sturgeon's rationale for keeping her on but I suspect she's had the same thought when making her decision.

Then again, I don't want ""we're in a crisis"" to be the justification for not ever removing someone, because that's a dangerous precedent."

I'm really trying to strike a positive note here, because the alternative is I'll keep having anxiety attacks about this."
Scotland,"I'm not kidding - I am of course aware of that but I'm also seeing many action groups of facebook and people genuinely helping. The fish man came round and sanitised his hands as he stepped out his van; I've had two notes round the door notifying me of volunteer groups able to help vulnerable people; there are online communities advising each other, making deliveries for those who can't leave; people making efforts to get food from restaurants forced into becoming takeaways.

I know there are dickheads up here just like there are down south. But I'm also seeing a lot of good people stepping up. When this panic buying abates (and genuinely, where I am in Scotland it doesn't seem to be as bad at least), more and more will look after others. I have to believe that because life is about to get grim and I want to have faith in our people to do the right thing."
Scotland,"Oh yeah, I didn't mean to imply that everyone *must* go and volunteer - clearly given your situation you're better off staying put. Hope said person has a change of tune.

EDIT: I read your other comment to me. I agree, it's a precarious situation and there are no easy answers."
Scotland,"Perhaps not, my friend, but it's what's keeping me going right now. I'm taking this weekend to mentally recuperate then it's straight into volunteering. We can't control the actions of others but with more of us doing good work, that changes the culture in a big way! Stay safe and have faith. :)"
Scotland,"If we play this right - and I know it seems to be happening in my area - we'll prove to the world that Scotland is a nation of people who look out for one another, and learn that we have those qualities in ourselves.

Remains to be seen but I have faith. Our country has its bad spots but we are a community in the end."
politics,"No, that's true. My point was from a different angle. More people die from the flu, right, but then we KNOW how the numbers and generally speaking a country should be able to accommodate what comes in. But then you add this virus on top, and THAT'S where the danger is. It's the flu, the virus, and all the other things that might happen on top which carries a huge risk."
politics,"I mean, I just said back what the guy above me said (""I dont think you understand""). I don't think that was any more dickish than they were being, and I should point out that I'm not the same user as that who the parent comment is replying to. Just wanted to note that.

And I don't think I'm wrong in pointing out that this risks overwhelming our health services, and that we don't have the various kinds of protections we have against the flu. This IS bad, and perhaps the severity is low to the general population... I mean shit dude. We're heading for a really dark place and I'm terrified. My mum's operation has already been cancelled."

TooAfraidToAsk,"It most likely would, yes. But setting aside the practicalities of implementing that, there's a reason you don't want to do that.

Essentially, this virus could come back to bite us in the future, and since our immune systems aren't geared to fight it, we'd have this problem all over again. Instead, what we need is herd immunity, which means that enough of us have had the virus and beat it, and thus it can't spread as easily any more.

So, in order to stop this thing, we have to limit the spread, but also spread out the infections over a longer period. This'll help health services cope, and by the time winter rolls around, the virus won't pose the same threat because a bunch of us have beaten it, and there could be a vaccine available."
ukpolitics,"I'm no supporter of the government normally, but I do think they're handling this right. I've heard the justifications as to why we're doing what we're doing, they're listening to the scientists, it's a good sign.
