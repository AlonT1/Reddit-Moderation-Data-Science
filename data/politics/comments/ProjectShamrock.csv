First, a fake cop shows up to case his house and there's no indication that Mr. McAllister has a problem with that, then even after the burglaries and arrests the Wet Bandits survive despite threatening his son and destroying stuff in his house.

This is the only way I've seen people score more than one goal in this mode."

texas,"> Countless major companies such as Apple, Tesla, CBRE, Oracle, Charles Schwab, Toyota, etc... are not moving to Texas for the liberal policies and democrat politicians. They are leaving California and taking the jobs with them as a result of the liberal policies voted in by democrat politicians.

This is not true at all and is a complete mischaracterization of things.  California and Texas are both very diverse states with both extremely liberal urban and extremely conservative rural areas.  Firstly your list of companies isn't even really accurate of places moving to Texas, rather they're operating in Texas in addition to other places.  Apple for example if I recall correctly is supposedly headquartered in Ireland, although they just built a massive campus in California that isn't going away.  

Additionally, it's not like these companies are leaving San Francisco to go to a more conservative city like Lubbock or Amarillo -- they're going to Austin.  Sure, there are statewide differences between the two but if Democratic policies were so terrible, you'd see these companies moving to places that aren't run by Democrats.  Even ignoring those companies, if you look at the GDP that Texas provides, the majority of it comes from Democratically lead areas.  The rural, Republican-lead areas are a net drain on the state's funds rather than contributing.

That being said, my goal isn't to be pro-Democratic and anti-Republican.  In my opinion one of the things that has made Texas successful as a state is when we have a good balance of Republican and Democratic control over different parts of our government and some amount of compromise is made to allow us to have the best of both political viewpoints.  Texas has a long history of Democratic politicians and Republican politicians.  While it's not really a swing state right now, it's still somewhere that works best when everyone works together instead of constantly trying to undermine or one up each other."

CoronaVirusTX,"> Do I just live in a bubble where nobody I know and nobody anyone I know knows anyone who has even so much as been hospitalized.

This is how it worked for me.  I didn't know a single person that got it until about May, when some of my wife's family got it, and recovered.  Then I didn't know anyone that had it, although I'd hear stories here and there of people from work or people that have someone they know.  Not a major deal really.

In October, I found out that an elderly relative in a nursing home tested positive, then two days later died.  About a week after that, four closer relatives got it, two were hospitalized, and one died.  So I'd guess that in a period of less than three weeks I went from basically nothing to being down two members of my family.  Since then I haven't heard of anyone getting it in the past few weeks.

My point is, it doesn't hit your family until it does, if that makes sense.  It all feels abstract and sort of how you feel, and then when people get it and either are asymptomatic or have very mild cases it's almost like, ""wait, that's it?"" but then when you start to lose people, especially if they were otherwise healthy it's more shocking.  What also seems scary is that I don't really have a firm grasp of the long-term health problems that people have.  For example my grandmother had it, as did my uncle and his wife that she lives with.  Are the three of them screwed?  Are they much more likely to have a stroke or heart attack now that they had COVID?  Maybe, but I can't quantify it, which makes it that much scarier.  Or what if I send my kids to school in person and they get it?  Will they have life-long health problems because of it?  It's hard to say because the information isn't completely clear yet."
AskAnAmerican,I guess now is the time for me to start investing in real estate on the Baltic sea around Sweden.  I imagine the coastal area south of Stockholm around the Kalmar Straight is protected from big waves as well.
AskAnAmerican,"It's a nice place to visit and if you can afford it and not commute it can be a nice place to live.  The surrounding areas have some nice natural beauty as well.

That being said, I'd probably live in one of the other cities first, because they're bigger and have more employers in my experience.  I'd probably rank the top five cities I'd prefer something like:

1. Houston
2. Dallas
3. Austin
4. San Antonio
5. Fort Worth"
AskAnAmerican,"It seems like it would be boring to stay in one spot forever.  I've lived in several places and will likely move again at some point.  When I get old and retire I'll probably end up somewhere with a nice yet inexpensive beach culture like Mexico or Spain, but who knows what the world will be like by then?"
AskReddit,"I forgot the bald thing.  I have two friends that keep their heads shaved at this point.  One of my best friends always had curly red hair, now he looks like he could be Bill Burr's younger brother.  Another one still looks very young despite the shaved head so it isn't as jarring as the guy with the white beard.  It's like he knocked Santa off his roof last Christmas and is now cursed or something."

Futurology,"We're very much a, ""you're paid to be at the office these set hours"" type of place. I've ran that I used to sit near would arrive to the office then go eat breakfast together. Then they do a little bit of time at their desks, then head out for lunch. Most of them would leave early too.  Other people would just sit at their desks and goof off as well. I'm on reddit so I can't criticize them either.

It seems so clear to me that there is a huge gulf between productivity and physical presence that the two are likely unrelated in most cases."
AskReddit,Unlike actual poo.
AskReddit,"It's a highly personal one, but I saw a photo of a high school classmate and that dude looked old as fuck.  I don't know if he saw a ghost or what but his hair turned white and he has a white beard.  If I grow a beard there is some gray mixed in around my sideburns I guess but it's shocking to see that.

One bonus one, I have some cousins in their 30's, one on each side of my family, that are grandparents.  However, that's a teenage pregnancy having a kid who also got pregnant as a teen.  It's such a weird concept to me, because nobody in my siblings even has a kid old enough to be pregnant so it feels like it's too early to be a grandparent in your 30's."
virtualreality,"I know it's far from being current, but as someone still using the original Rift I'm sure the Rift S is a solid headset based on what I've read.  Since it depends on your PC, I imagine that you'll be fine for a few years with it and you saved a lot of money by purchasing it now rather than a much more expensive headset.

Having dipped my toes in VR, I find that a lot of it just isn't stuff I'll spend enough time on to be able to justify a $600 HP Reverb G2 at this point or anything more expensive.  As new games come out I think that could be improved, and I really wish that the Oculus had a better way to watch 360 videos in Youtube than that junky Deo VR app.  Hopefully the software becomes more commonplace and we'll see more affordable, high quality hardware as a result."

OutOfTheLoop,"The Republicans after likely to use the drama against Biden through his administration. I can see states suing and refusing to go along with any covid plans, the Senate refusing to seat any of his cabinet, etc. They're likely to obstruct him more then they did Obama at this point."
Fatherhood,"My parents divorced when I was little, and my ""dad"" didn't do a great job.  In some ways I appreciate some of the things he taught me, but it came with a lot of shit too.  Frankly, my father figures were mostly the men on TV that I would watch.  I say this not to try to outdo what you feel, but to say that having a father figure isn't going to ""fix"" you.  You are who you are and I'm sure that despite whatever you might not like, there is good in you and you just need more people that care in your life.  Life can be long and full of new experiences and relationships so don't worry.  At 16, you have a lot of time to experience meeting new people who can become mentors, friends, etc."
AskAnAmerican,"You should try driving a sports car.  If you want to be cut off by a pissed off dad in a minivan for no reason, a red Porsche is the way to go.  I've thought about getting a Blue Camaro or something for my next car because it's still sporty, but not something that I would expect people to freak out about."
TropicalWeather,Obviously the hurricanes can be much worse in the gulf but there's something extra scary about experiencing storms on the great lakes.  Perhaps it's because they tend to pop up more suddenly.
politics,"We could carve out a new state called, ""Real Texas"" that includes the land mass from Houston up to Dallas, extending through Austin, San Antonio, and the RGV."
politics,I'm a left wing person in Texas that voted for Biden. I can assure you that if these states actually try secession (which I don't think is likely) all of us in the cities that actually make the GDP for the state will either shut that shit down or leave and take our money and skills with us. The free people that actually want to secede have no skills and will not survive without our services and tax dollars paying for them.
pics,Is this from the reboot with the female Teal'c that leads the people away from the Cylons in her Tardis?
PS5,I actually still have my PS2 and a CRT so I can play light gun games.
PS5,"> I guess that would be neat in that it’s sort of consumer friendly? As in your games from long ago that you bought are still usable.

Right.  I have an X1X and there are a few older games I still like to play off and on.  Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a fun example that they upgraded the graphics to for free.  The ones I mainly play though are even older and were released in some state for older XBox models, such as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night or Final Fight.  Halo 3, Assassin's Creed, and others are fun to some degree but the newer games are overall a better experience on the newer hardware.  Plus some of my favorite older games were never made backwards compatible, so even if I wanted to I couldn't play them.

That being said, I do feel like Backwards Compatibility and GamePass are two advantages that the XBox has.  At least for me, I'm content keeping my X1X while also using my PS5 though.  I have no plans to get a new XBox in the near future even when they start releasing next gen games.  Maybe when Forza Horizon 5 is released and if my gaming PC isn't good enough for it.  I wish there would be a Sony equivalent to that series because I imagine the cars would be beautiful on the PS5 with ray tracing on the shiny paint and everything."
PS5,"Another advantage to XBox is that you can play digital games going backwards three generations to the original model with the XSX or XSS, and in some cases they've even enhanced their graphics to look good on modern platforms at no extra cost.  I can't go back and play the original God of War or Grand Turismo 2 in 4K on my PS5 yet, for example."
politics,Yep. I live in Texas too and I'm about feed up with the stupid shit that goes down in the rural areas holding all the actually productive parts of the state hostage. Let all of us actually making money leave first and we'll take our skills and productivity elsewhere.
xboxone,"I hate these videos that just show the original XBox One and not the One X as well.  I own a One X and in the videos I've seen of other games I don't see a graphical difference, mainly the loading times are a huge improvement."
movies,"It's completely legitimate to worry about the future of the art form and the lives of all those who are being impacted by theaters being shut down, movies not being made, etc. due to the pandemic.  I can't read this specific article, but from what I've read of Nolan's complaints, he isn't as focused on those things as much as the more abstract idea of the artistry of movies and how he believes some of that is being lost by people not attending cinemas to watch movies.  As I suspect the article says (again, it has a paywall) it's not the right time to make that argument while the world is in the middle of a pandemic where it's irresponsible for large groups of people to come together in enclosed spaces with recirculated air conditioning.  He would be more heroic if his complaints stopped at how to help people in the industry who aren't rich make ends meet.  He also should have delayed Tenent to be released in theaters when it would be safe to do so, instead of forcing employees back into unsafe jobs at theaters so they could avoid being kicked off of unemployment."
PS5,"I just want someone to make some good Castlevania games again (and I'm aware of the Bloodstained games and have enjoyed them.)  If they're exclusive to one console that would suck, but at least new games would exist."
PS5,"> You will also need to create a Ps account so worth setting up early, you may also accounts for the kids and parental control if required.

On top of that, if you are planning to get PS+ I would go ahead and do that in advance as well.  I am in a similar position to OP and I did it in November to take advantage of getting the games included then.  I'm also concerned that there's going to be a lot of slow download speeds and servers being hit hard on Christmas morning."
Coronavirus,"As others have pointed out, there are friends and relatives who I've diminished contact with not because we can't meet face to face as opposed to through technology, but because of how they have reacted to COVID.  I can pick back up a relationship later with good people who I may not have been able to see as much on Zoom or Facetime or whatever.  I have no interest in a relationship with people who have spread COVID and killed other relatives with it, for example."
ViralTexas,"Sort of a double standard with how much they keep trying to force kids into face to face, while lying about COVID numbers and not taking proper precautions."
todayilearned,"That's mostly surprising to people because they believe the Aztecs were ancient, as opposed to historical latecomers that actually got their start after building upon prior civilizations.  They're probably more famous than the prior grand civilizations of Mexico (except maybe the Mayans) because of the European priests and historians who met them and wrote about them (also while simultaneously destroying the books from the Aztecs and earlier groups.)"
AskReddit,"When I was their age I'd play video games, basketball, watch fun movies, and go on bike rides.  I do the same stuff with my kids now, so the only difference would be that I have more time for that stuff since I would have less responsibilities for that 24 hours.

As for something more interesting, they have a few friends that are spoiled brats and too whiny so I'd probably do something about that."
AskReddit,"While what you said sounds like a truism, there is evidence to the contrary.  For example, some of [the charity work the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has done](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/bill-gates-philanthropy-warren-buffett-vaccines-infant-mortality) has saved millions upon millions of lives.  While it's true that simply throwing money out there isn't going to be very helpful, donating large sums of money intelligently solves a great deal of problems.  Even the recent news of how [Dolly Parton helped pay for a breakthrough COVID vaccine](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/entertainment/dolly-parton-moderna-covid-vaccine-reaction-trnd/index.html) is a good example.  Another thought experiment you could do would be to consider how blindly giving people money may be useful.  For example, let's assume a tax on billionaires is put in place that results in everyone you know receiving an extra $1,000/month in a check from the government.  Will some people waste that money?  Absolutely.  Will the majority of people you know waste that money?  At least for myself, I would not say so.  Most people would use it to pay off debts, invest in improvements for their lives, etc.  Even spending it on consumer goods would actively put that money out in the economy instead of being hoarded to accumulate interest.  Money can definitively be used to improve things for a lot of people.  While it's truly impossible to ""permanently solve problems"" in any case, money helps make progress that can persist for a long time.  However, life in general requires some level of effort but money can amplify that beneficial effect."
tacos,I haven't been in years so I can't offer any specifics but I had amazing Mexican food in NC when I used to live there.
AskReddit,"Wow, I have a very similar story where a new guy at work found out I was interested in guitars and kept telling me about the custom guitar work he does in a way that made me feel like he was talking down to me.  I hadn't spoken to him since then as a result.  I assume it's not the same guy, so there must be like a league of custom guitar snobs out there that go around infiltrating workplaces to make people feel bad."
IWantOut,"As someone in a similar position to OP, I'd actually be curious if you have any statistics on how the job market for more experienced positions goes for someone in his position.  Both he and his spouse are fairly experienced and in managerial positions.  As someone in a similar role working in the U.S. I don't see many jobs at that level being offered to foreigners.  The majority of the jobs available for people who wish to become expats seem to be entry level positions with extremely low pay.  In the U.S. I'd expect someone like OP to make at least the equivalent €130k annually, not including bonuses, LTI plans, etc."
AskAnAmerican,"If the jobs provided were so great, why would be be seeing such dramatic differences in income equality, and using the original person's example of Walmart, why are so many people with jobs on welfare because they can't afford to live otherwise?"
AskAnAmerican,"As cool as it would be to work for SpaceX, I hear that they don't treat their employees well, plus moving to Brownsville if you're used to city life is going to suck for a lot of smarter people.  I know NASA gets away with moving really smart people to places where they'll get bored but I'm skeptical that SpaceX will have the same ability."
politics,The guy is kind of crazy. Do a Google search for him and the Mexican equivalent to Air Force One for example.
AskReddit,"Wow, I've never tried eBay for clothes. Are they usually legitimate or knock offs? They must be from places like Saks Off 5th if they are legit.

Also I used to work with a guy that would go to places like TJ Max and Marshalls to get name brand purses and sell them on eBay for a profit. I think he mainly got Coach and never something more expensive but it seemed to work out as an occasional thing."
NoStupidQuestions,"I take it you've never heard of some of the ancient African civilizations, such as [the Kush](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/kingdoms-kush/), which at one point even ruled over ancient Egypt?"
xboxone,Thanks!
technology,"Well yeah, but not bad enough to call the cops like some people have done."
Coronavirus,"I think we have [a good indication of the long term effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351), but we probably don't know 1) what percentage of people who survive the virus end up with each of them, or 2) how long it takes for people who have them to fully recover (if ever.)"
AskReddit,Indeed.  I noticed these shirts becoming see-through and just generally worse.  I understand if it's a $20 Walmart dress shirt but something that cost me over $100 shouldn't be cheaply built.  So I abandon those brands over time and migrate to new ones that are better.  One area that I am likely overpaying but still like are some shirts made with Supima cotton.  Those are really smooth but also have a good thickness and seem to last pretty well.  I recently bought a black one and I'll be curious to see how well it maintains the color.
Coronavirus,"I live in Texas where I think everything is open at 100%.  However, a lot of companies with white collar jobs are still allowing their people to telecommute and still doing things like extra cleaning, requiring face masks, taking temperatures, etc.  I think we will reach a point (likely sooner than is safe) of companies abandoning all that and going to how things were in February."
Coronavirus,"So based on your decision with the COVID vaccine, have you started considering other vaccinations as well now?"
Coronavirus,"This is fair, considering the long term health effects that even younger people who survive COVID are dealing with.  That being said, I wonder how tolerant society and the government will be of people who are trying to stay safe once the highest risk people are vaccinated."
technology,"I have personally seen it when I had a Ring doorbell.  I forget what the feature is called where you can see videos of other people but a lot of them were ""suspicious people"" who were in fact residents that lived in the area, delivery people, or people leaving business cards on doors.  I even recall there was a controversy about someone supposedly ""casing houses"" and it was actually a person working for the HOA and had a sign on their door in one of the videos representing the company that runs the HOA.  If you'd like to see a similar situation, check out the Nextdoor social media site."
AskReddit,"I would dispute that.  I have some old clothing that I still wear that was expensive.  That being said, it varies even inside of expensive labels and from one year to another.  I used to wear a lot of Lacoste no iron shirts over a decade ago and I noticed that their cloth got thinner and thinner from one year to the next and they used less colors, so I ended up completely abandoning the brand.  However, I've found others that are decent and have lasted since then."
technology,"It's not the device, but the ""social media"" aspect of it where you can share videos with your neighbors.  Psychologically what are people supposed to think when Person A posts, ""Here's a video of a suspicious black man"", then Person B posts, ""Here's a photo of someone in a hoodie breaking into my car"", over and over.  It associates black men with crimes in people's minds, even if the black man in this case is just a neighbor out for a morning jog.

The other aspect that isn't racial but is concerning is that [police are given access to Ring videos](https://www.govtech.com/security/Amazons-Ring-Video-Camera-Alarms-Privacy-Advocates.html) that consumers may not be aware of.  I would agree that if a crime happens and I have video of it, I'll happily share it with the cops.  However, I would not want this sharing to be a passive thing where they can tap into my videos in the cloud whenever they want."

AskAnAmerican,"I like both.  However, I'd give the edge to Arizona specifically because you have the Grand Canyon.  That alone puts it above New Mexico and can drop the mic.  The massive meteor crater and the petrified wood are just the icing on the cake in that regard.

Both do have a lot of natural beauty though, and both have interesting history, food, etc.  I also feel like the Mexican food is better in Arizona, particularly further south where you can find Sonoran-style Mexican food (such as in Tucson.)

That being said, the mountains are better in New Mexico in my opinion and I'd give the edge to the Native American ruins in New Mexico from that perspective."

movies,"You can pick up a 55"" TV for less than $300 today at Walmart or wherever.  While that's not going to be the best TV and while some people can't afford to spend $300 frivolously, that's extremely cheap to get a TV of that size."
AskAnAmerican,"Yeah, the loud stereotype is completely justified as far as tourists are concerned.  We're not the only ones that are loud, but it's a pretty defining trait at least among the type of people who travel outside of the country."
AskAnAmerican,"> Sorry we don’t have castles dating back to 1437

This is a pet peeve where I think we as America have failed to really market ourselves appropriately both internally and externally.  We have stuff [like this](https://i.imgur.com/WDJ4TRy.jpg), [this](https://i.imgur.com/JluaTgZ.jpg), and [this](https://i.imgur.com/vwnH7qr.jpg).  America has ancient monuments and they are amazing.  I've personally seen a few of them but I feel like too many Americans haven't or have no interest in it.  I suspect we as a society have ignored these because of the historical genocide against the Native Americans, but I feel like it would help if all Americans were more aware of what they accomplished in the past and had more respect for those living now.  This land has a lot of history even if not all of our ancestors were here for the earliest parts of it."
AskAnAmerican,A lot of the stuff they do and say is pure hyperbole one way or another and intended to be funny reactions to stuff.  The people on that channel are generally either stupid or pretending to be for the sake of getting more viewers.  It's like reality TV from the dollar store.
ViralTexas,"He's a piece of shit and a traitor to America, but I'm not sure that this is on topic for this sub."
OutOfTheLoop,"That's pretty typical of what we would consider developing or third-world nations though.  I'm ignoring ""third world"" because that's an outdated political alignment reference and going with the current moniker of ""developing nation"".  The main difference between a developing nation and a developed one is measured in the quality of life and resources available to the average person.  All levels -- from abject poverty to extreme wealth -- tend to be available in most countries including poor ones.  The difference is the ratio of people in poverty to the wealthy tend to be worse off than in more prosperous ""developed"" nations."
SalsaSnobs,This was my guess as well.
AskAnAmerican,"This is my take as well.  I don't think that the government actually put effort into planning for a draft, apart from the stop loss extensions.  However, post-9/11 was a very uncertain world and a lot of people I knew were concerned about the possibility of being drafted if the Iraq war got worse or if a new war was started."
ViralTexas,"This seems like a fairly weak thing because:

1. Testing should have been ramped up appropriately back in the spring or early summer at the latest.

2. I don't think having businesses perform the tests is going to be appropriately done.  Like I imagine you're working at a taqueria and your boss wants to stick an oversized Q-tip up your nostril to tickle your brain.  It will probably either hurt or damage you, plus there's a chance it could be left out or contaminated in some way.

So overall I would applaud any increase in testing or things that might work against the virus but this is a joke."

news,"When the pandemic started we were all completely at home.  They started bringing us back to the office in May and haven't really relented since then.  I go to the office and don't even talk to someone face to face except the security guards who I have to show an email on my phone so I can be let into the building.  Everyone just goes to their desks and sits down to work.  I have an office so I keep my door shut (like all the other managers) and our teams just keep to themselves as well, and we all eat at our desks.  The pay is pretty good and I'm fortunate to have a job, but I'm not going to lie -- all of my friends and acquaintances outside of the office that have similar jobs are working from home right now so I feel some resentment."

The only real one I can thing of is the Nissan 370Z (ignoring the GT-R or the Acura NSX because they're too expensive, and excluding the Supra because it's German.)  They do make little sporty cars, but nothing with real muscle that the average person can own."

I also want my entire family to get it around the same time so we can all be covered.  However, I'll take it whenever it's made available because I'm going into the office every day to sit my ass at a desk instead of telecommuting, so I'm putting my family in danger because of stupid corporate policy.  However, I see a lot less people than those working at all the full restaurants and retail businesses around so I'd prefer they get it first because they truly are essential."
NoStupidQuestions,The majority of Americans can't afford to travel internationally.  People who are wealthy enough to go on foreign travels generally have health insurance or something in place that will alleviate the costs unless it's more of a surprise problem (e.g. what you see with insane bills treating COVID-19.)

politics,"The problem is that there's a lot they can do to still prevent his success.  Executive orders can still be challenged in the judicial system, and SCOTUS is now under the control of religious nuts.  In fact, I'm pretty sure the Senate can just refuse to approve any of Biden's nominations for cabinet members and refuse to vote on a federal budget and basically bring the country to it's knees with no real repercussions for them.  I hope I'm wrong on this but I don't trust Republicans to ever do the right thing at this point and to never hesitate to collectively shoot all of us in the foot at the same time."

PS5,Same here.  I won't be buying it on any platform until it's on a good sale.  Hopefully right after Christmas that happens.
politics,"This is what concerns me as well.  The current president of Mexico is a douchebag and claimed to be ""legitimate president"" for years and constantly tried to undermine the country.  The last presidential election there had pretty weak candidates all around so he was able to find his way into the presidency and has been wrecking their economy.

I can't help but wonder if the Republicans in the Senate are going to sabotage Biden in every way possible, in unprecedented ways even in comparison to their obstruction of Obama's presidency.  By making Biden weak, they'll be able to run Trump or someone like him but actually a little competent that runs under the Trumpian mantle in four years."

AskReddit,"It's too complicated of a topic to visit all the facets but it should be obvious that there's a biological component to that, as one of the biological purposes of life is to reproduce.  Humans have greater intellect than to work as purely biological entities but that doesn't mean we don't feel the pull of that instinct.

Also, as someone who has family members that have adopted, adoption vs. giving birth is a very different process and has different concerns, risks, benefits, etc.  While the end result of ""raising a child"" is similar there are still a lot of factors that can't be ignored where they are different.

On a more sentimental note, it can be comforting from a mortality perspective to see a kid running around that looks like you, has a lot of common personality traits to you, etc.  It's entirely possible to love an adopted child and have them love you back just as strongly as a biological child, but there's still something different if the kid is of your heritage.  On a personal level, when my dad died I took some comfort in seeing his grandson that looks a lot like him in his baby photos, who has his same laugh, etc.  There's a certain aspect of continuity to perhaps cheat death in a way by having some aspect of a person still around in later generations."

CasualConversation,"That's really cool.  I also found a ""dream gift"" of sorts, in that when we went to Paris last year we found a small perfume shop near where we stayed that she bought from and loved their scents.  They don't have a store in the U.S. and aren't sold anywhere that I've found, but I was able to get in contact with them and ordered some to be mailed from France to the U.S. for her.  I already received it but had to hide the box without her knowing."
changemyview,"I don't feel like there's enough detail about the structure of the governing body overseeing this town to really argue for or against your view.  While it's possible that you're right, I can imagine other ways that it could fail including:

1. What if the company can't get good workers to go there, because it's in the middle of nowhere and has no additional pay up front to account for additional things like consumer electronics, vacations, savings, etc?  You could get startup workers but if people are paying $600/month rent without any specific pay until the company is profitable would eat through their prior savings, if they had any.

2. Without a good founding document to put solid rules and protections in place, the people actually controlling the area will likely hit some unresolvable conflict that will tear their organization apart.  Since the workers would not be in positions of power, their only recourse would be to leave the town the moment the first leadership crisis hits.

3. Corporations are legal entities that exist as a result of the government.  In the U.S. we have sort of a twisted perspective on how corporate power is, but in reality they were meant to exist to allow private citizens to organize in ways to accomplish things for a society.  For example, if a road needs to be built, a group of people would come together and ask the government to allow them to incorporate to raise funds and build that road.  Obviously this has evolved over the years but that's basically what purpose they serve.  So in your scenario, you aren't really explaining how such a corporation would be communist or anything radically structurally different from what we have now."
AskAnAmerican,"> For me, its not fair that resources that should be dedicated to citizens and legal residents should also be used for illegal immigrants.

So if you are a citizen and a bunch of people that live around you happen to be here illegally, would you be ok if the budget for the local police force is reduced because of the non-citizens?  How about the fire department?  That's what you're talking about.

> Diverting resources for illegal immigrants only incentivizes more to come here and it's a slap in the face of legal immigrants who went through the process to come here legally only for illegal immigrants to skip the line and be considered the same as them.

I think you don't know anything about immigration to have such a view.  First, the majority of people here illegally [entered legally but their visas expired](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us).  Secondly, there's really no ""line"" for two reasons:  1) there's [not really any legal options to enter the U.S. as an unskilled worker with no relatives who can sponsor you](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5404217), 2) the number of people who enter illegally have no impact on legal immigration at all.  Additionally, being considered ""the same as them"" is about human rights and not about the privileges of U.S. citizenship or anything like that.  The Constitution grants us certain inalienable rights as human beings, and the rights of citizens go beyond that to participate in the government.

> I meant that those areas would have less incentive to enforce immigration laws and deport illegal immigrants if they knew that their state would end up getting more representation.

This still doesn't work, because the state has no business enforcing federal laws, that's up to the federal government.  For example if the residents of Rhode Island start committing massive federal income tax fraud on a large scale but properly do their state taxes, should the state officials investigate that or should it be the responsibility of the IRS to go after them first, only involving state officials as necessary?  The paperwork involved with immigration has nothing to do with state governments."
AskAnAmerican,"> The only reason being that the Census is what determines how much representation states get depending on the population.

If an area has a significant number of people in the country illegally, wouldn't they deserve to have sufficient resources allocated through government to address whatever is needed as a result?

> If illegal immigrants are allowed to be counted towards the census, that only gives incentives for states and local areas to keep more illegal immigrants in their area in order to get more representation in Congress.

How would this even be a reasonable thing for a state to come up with?  Like what's the process you envision for a governor to work with business leaders to somehow encourage people to enter the country illegally to live there, as opposed to going through a similar process to encourage citizens to move there?  How much power do you think these states have to influence people?  None of this makes any sense based on historical or current politics and economics."

NoStupidQuestions,"I would get her Copic markers, either Sketch or Classic.  Yes they're expensive but they're perfect for what you are looking for.  There are different packs that you can buy in different colors depending on what she wants to do.  I'd start by asking her what she already has and if she has some Copics you would know which colors to not get.

As for sketch pads, just make sure it's a good quality paper that can properly absorb the markers.  The paper should mention something about being bleedproof or for markers in some way.  As another person suggested, if you shop at Michael's I'd suggest looking there especially if you have a good coupon."
retrogaming,"I really like beat'em up type games.  I know there's a modern Streets of Rage that came out and while it was pretty fun, there was something about the older ones that made them nicer in my opinion.  I kind of like games like Double Dragon and Final Fight -- just give me a directional pad/joystick and a few buttons to jump and beat some ass."
AskAnAmerican,"> People overemphasize telecommuting a lot. There was a study that showed most people won't do 100% telecommuting and that most people would go into an office at least a couple days a week.

Even that would make things better, and if telecommuting were more prominent businesses would find ways to adjust to that environment that would either render those few days per week moot or maximize efficiency in those days to perhaps either minimize them or bring everyone in on a specific schedule.  That being said, I focused on telecommuting because it's sort of a no brainer that will eliminate some of the traffic.  Obviously people that do physical labor or have to meet with customers/clients face to face in some capacity would not be able to participate, but even if we reduced traffic by 25%-50% that would make a huge difference in everyone's lives.

> Also the job is only part of the reason people live in any given city with the city and what it has to offer itself probably being a big incentive.

Right, but given the right circumstances people could ""travel"" more even if it means they live 2-3 hours from a big city and stay in a hotel on the weekends.  I would also think that at least some of the types of businesses people look for in a city could be moved outside of the core area of town.

> The cities need to be competitive which is why you see a lot these companies setting up shop in cities that have notable colleges or midsize cities that are already pretty established. The city needs to have something going for it already. Also putting the company outside the city center doesn't work since most major tech companies are not in San Francisco to begin with and this area is still a mess. LA is a city that doesn't even have a city center and is just a collection of small cities and they have issues as well.

For both of these, I wouldn't look to California as a good example because their cities are geographically limited and especially in southern California water is a huge concern.  To use a Texas-specific example, I could see room for a lot more construction between Austin and San Antonio on the farmland east of 35.  If we use Chicago as an example, if companies located to Peoria or Rockford or something like that, it's still close enough for occasional trips into big city as needed.  This really only works well for cities in big flat areas.  The biggest obstacle I see is the state or local government being a problem more than anything else.

In terms of what I meant by ""white flight"" and increasing commutes, it's basically the status quo.  ""White flight"" refers to white people having good real estate values but once the perception of minorities moving into their community happens, white people start leaving for elsewhere and cause an actual drop in real estate prices which cascades into actual decline in that area.  It happened in the past as white people left cities for the suburbs, and has been happening recently in reverse where they're snapping up inexpensive properties inside of urban areas."
AskAnAmerican,"There are a lot, but I think the one that has the most is probably Vietnamese food.  Despite how many latinos live in the area and Texas being on the border, Mexican food (at least the real stuff) can be hard to come by unless you know how to find hidden gems of taco trucks and such.  We have a lot of Chinese and Indian food too, but Vietnamese food is probably the biggest foreign food I see."
AskAnAmerican,"There are ways to combat that though.  The options are pretty much:

1. Provide programs to force companies to let office workers telecommute, and encourage them to move elsewhere.

2. Give incentives to large companies to move to either declining cities or cities that have room to grow.  Perhaps encouraging companies to build their locations further away from the central areas of the major city would help in this regard.

3. Keep on the same path of ""white flight"", increasing commutes, and waste."
movies,"I can't help but imagine someone going to the theater and it turning out to be a superspreader event and as they lay dying in the hospital their last thought would be, ""I can rest easily now, at least I got to see the sequel to The Croods."""
AskAnAmerican,"I smoked while in high school and even did an internship at RJR years ago.  As to the feeling of smoking while there's a buzz to it at first, that fades after a while and you end up just being irritated to not smoke several times per day as opposed to it making you feel good.  The other items you mentioned can have other benefits as long as the person isn't addicted to them."
politics,"They'll have to categorize them even further then, because a lot of them entered legally and have social security numbers but their visa expired, or they have a TIN, or they are paying taxes against someone else's SSN through fraud.  Additionally, they're all paying sales taxes.  The ""Indians not taxed"" really shouldn't apply in any way and if it does, they should be required to narrow it down to some category of people who have no way to pay income or sales taxes."
PS5,"It's possible that they have kids and either a toddler might destroy it or they have a kid who is old enough to want to play but maybe OP plays too many rated M games.

She could obviously be being unreasonable as well, but I hate to jump to that conclusion until there's some evidence that there's no good reason for her to not want the PS5 in the living room."
NoStupidQuestions,"So I don't have a lot of information that would help you until you're old enough to drink, assuming you live in the U.S.  For a moment though, assume it's two years later so you're 21, COVID is done, and all is back to normal.

Basically there are bars that either single cougars go to or women with their friends for a night out.  Look around for ""ladies night"" specials for places that might fit the bill -- fruity drinks, not really dance clubs (or if there are, themed nights for music too old for you.)  You can probably find these either on Facebook or ask on your local subreddit.  Anyway, once you go to one of these bars it's best to have a wingman of similar mind that can help you out and give you some credibility/support.  Sit at the bar and look around, then mentally make a plan of who to talk to.  I'd suggest either a woman by herself or with just one friend.  Groups of women tend to be part of an event of some sort and are there to spend time with their friends instead of mixing.  If she is receptive to you buying her a drink or whatever, and has a friend with her, invite your friend over to talk to her friend.

There's obviously more to it but at a high level a generic approach to meeting women in bars applies to the type you're interested in as well.

Prior to that, your best bet is probably dating apps but it's likely you'll find more problems that way."

changemyview,">>Throw some videos of viewing areas being boarded up, unmarked vans unloading ballots in wagons, people walking into counting stations with coolers being unchecked by security, and finally some places allowing votes to be mailed in after Election Day and it makes a perfect storm of evidence to build a conspiracy theory from.

>Yeah, except none of that happened.

You're not looking at this from the perspective of someone that is primed to believe in election fraud.  I don't think their logic is sound either, but if there's for example unmarked vans loading boxes of voting machines, it can be easy to convince people that they are actually boxes of ballots.  Or if those coolers go through security before or after the camera is filming, if the people with coolers aren't going into the rooms where the ballots are, or if it's footage from another day of the year when that location was used for some other event, it doesn't matter because their perspective was already primed to expect fraud.  I have ""friends"" that have hopped on the ""everything that backs up my view is valid evidence"" train and get a lot of their information from random videos on Youtube.  While there's no easy way to counteract someone who doesn't use logic, it's necessary to consider how they got there if you want to make an attempt."
CasualConversation,"It might be easier if we put everyone in five basic categories:

1. Family in the same house

2. Friends

3. Extended family

4. Coworkers

5. Acquaintances/Strangers

For me, I would normally have contact with everyone but #3 regularly pre-COVID, only seeing my parents, siblings, etc. maybe once per year so I got used to it.  Right now, I really only have #1 available apart from #5 if I go shopping or the security guards at work that I say ""good morning"" to and that's about it.  My friends and coworkers are the ones I miss a lot because they're the ones I can talk to more, my s/o and kids I have to carefully filter what I'm going to say and there are a lot of topics that interest me that I can't really discuss with them.

In your situation it sounds like you don't really have any camaraderie with your coworkers and  (#4) and the general public #5 isn't really more than maybe customers or people you deal with in retail so that's not interesting as well.  Do you have friends in the same situation but people outside of work?  There may be others that you can hang out with who also go home to an empty apartment every day and the two of you could be fairly safe to hang out sometimes."

My company really sucks and I look forward to looking for a new job in 2021 because this shit sucks."

AskAnAmerican,"PROS:  He seemed like a good president for the economy, he carried himself in a very upbeat manner and while he was president I felt like the country was looking toward the future.

CONS:  He did some shady things and wasn't as honest as he should have been.  He was too conservative in many ways when he could have been doing better things.

Overall, I don't think he was a bad president, but I don't trust him either.  It's difficult to separate the right-wing conspiracy theories from the truth though, so I don't know if the areas I have a poor opinion of him on are real or not and since I was a kid when he was president I haven't felt it worthwhile to go back and research him as a person.  I also suspect that Hillary was perfectly fine with him sleeping around so I don't really buy the narrative that has been put out there about how he violated their marriage and how that makes him bad.  I think some of the real estate and other business deals and such are what I'd focus on more if I were trying to pass judgment on his character."

PS5,"I was listening to a podcast with Phil Spencer of Microsoft and he was lamenting this problem but he (and I suspect Sony and Nintendo are the same) have to walk a fine line in keeping their customers happy and keeping retailers happy.  In some ways, this whole process would be much better if we could just order all of our consoles directly from the source.  From what I've read here, it seems like those who bought a PS5 from Sony directly had a bit of a better experience despite the difficulty in getting past some of the anti-bot measures they put in place.  However, Sony can't sell too many of their own devices and bypass their retail partners because that would damage their long term sales of not only consoles but games and accessories too.  

That being said, I remember buying a Nintendo Wii a month or so after release from an online retailer (Circuit City, RIP.)  It was exactly the same, people clamoring online to be able to just submit an order, and retailers not stopping people from ordering multiple consoles or going into stores to do so, with the goal of reselling on eBay.  Retailers have had nearly a decade since then to take some sort of action and in general they've done little.  I'm really hoping that Sony's direct sales of the PS5 might be a warning shot to the retailers that they need to do a better job, but I'm skeptical that they will care enough to learn that lesson.

Ideally, when a console is released there should be some sort of waiting list that everyone can preorder from and go ahead and pay 100% for in advance.  The retailers would ship those orders into the manufacturer and then deliver the consoles as they become available.  There's no need for ""waves"" of consoles to become available, they should be very much first come first serve and if none are available now, that should be ok because of a waitlist."
IWantOut,"> Across the pond, Americans (of all races) automatically saw it as cultural appropriation.

I don't think the majority of Americans really cared about Adele's hairstyle, or if they were aware of it, found it distasteful in some way.  There's a certain type of clickbait where the media finds outrage on something on social media and uses that as an example of, ""People are upset about $x"" for stories.  It's not entirely fake controversy, but I would be surprised if even 1% of Americans who were aware of her hairstyle would have negative thoughts about it.  In general the serious problems that are referred to as ""cultural appropriation"" are when someone redefines a culture in a way that either reflects poorly on the original people (e.g. blackface minstrels) or if they overshadow the original in some way (e.g. if European people were cast in movies to play Asian roles in a movie set in Japan.)"

AskMenOver30,"I don't own Tesla stocks or one of their cars.  However, I think what you're possibly missing isn't just about the vehicles but the improvements in batteries, the charging infrastructure, and the improvements in automation in the manufacturing process as well.  That's not to say that what they've done nobody else can do, but I suspect they have patents on things that will make it harder for other companies to quickly develop competing technologies.  The fact is, Tesla cars are a hot commodity and tend to not lose their value over time.  They'll be screwed once they have serious competition from a more traditional car company but it's not like I can go easily buy a similarly priced all-electric Toyota, Honda, or Ford from the local dealerships right now.

In terms of the Mars mission, I guess I don't see why it's physically impossible to do with some reasonable improvements in current technology.  However, I think that would require it being a major priority for the U.S. or some other wealthy nation to put money into paying a lot of people to work on it.  That seems unreasonable so I would guess that it's not happening anytime soon."
PS5,"> I was playing Origins before PS5 arrived, it's kinda boring me 20 hours in.

What I specifically liked in Origins was the setting as well as how fun it was to raid castles.  Like I'd sneak up and scout out the area with my eagle then plan out a path through some weak spot (poorly guarded, plants and walls to hide behind, etc) and make it a challenge to kill as many people as possible stealthily.  Sometimes I'd try to keep just one person around to light the fire to bring more people in, then if I were leveled high enough I'd just try to take them all out using whatever advantage the terrain or even a horse would give me.  The story could have been compelling but it's a little too open and a lot is left to interpretation by the person playing the game.

As far as Odyssey is concerned, I like it too but I liked Origins better.  I felt that Odyssey has too many repeated settings (this may be due to how large the map is) and I didn't like that everyone could use a shield except for me.  I plan on getting Valhalla, but I might get that on my XBox One X so I can start playing it in the next few days while my PS5 is going to wait for Christmas and I want to get caught up on the games that are Sony exclusives at that point.

> GoT is in my top 4 (in no particular order; H:ZD, GoW, BoTW, GoT). Visually, combat wise, and story/setting is far more interesting for me in GoT than Origins. The story telling is outstanding. It should be at the top of every single-player story/rpg gamer's list if they haven't played it yet, in my opinion. It also looks and plays stunning on both PS4 and PS5.

This definitely sells it for me.  I'm looking forward to playing it now because from the videos I've seen and what I've read it seems like it's what Ubisoft has tried to do but has been less successful in the recent AC games.

Any time I've asked someone to provide evidence it's usually provided in the form of some random old white guy with a beard  on Youtube saying things angrily or a disreputable news source that makes vague allegations without any real meat to them.  What's legal or illegal does matter, as if a person breaks the law they can be held legally liable for it, like we're about to see with Trump in New York after he's out of office.  

Morality is absolutely important as well, but when you have members of a political campaign themselves breaking the law and potentially conspiring with foreign governments to break even more laws, that has to be investigated.  I'm aware of some surveillance of individuals in the Trump campaign.  Some of those people like Paul Manafort ended up in jail over it.  I wouldn't be surprised if others like Roger Stone and Michael Cohen will face new scrutiny and face additional jail time for it.

PS5,"> We don’t have the ability to hold them. Team members don’t even see the PS5s in the back if they do come in (which for my region, they haven’t.)

I agree with your first point which is the scenario I tried to explain for option #1, but I guarantee you that someone in your store has the ability to hold stuff even if it's only at the manager level.  If I were scummy enough to become a scalper, I would go to go around the stores and try to make friends with the appropriate people that can help me out.  Befriend them through small talk, buy them coffee, etc.  When hot collectible items come out, I would offer them a cut if they hold the devices and call me to come pick them up.  Using the specific example of a PS5 or XBox Series X, let's say I spend $500, give the manager a cut of $100/console, then turn around and sell them on eBay for $900 that is still pretty profitable for me.  Someone working at retail is also going to appreciate the extra money they're getting on the side too.

That being said, the best way for consumers to stop scalpers is to refuse to buy from them.  Make them waste their time and if they have to return some consoles after bribing the manager at a store it's going to be even more discouraging for them.  Even if they buy things fairly according to the rules, it's still going to waste their time if people don't buy their stuff, and that is time they could have spent on a legitimate line of business.  I really don't know who the people are out there that buy overpriced crap from scalpers but they should knock it off -- I could understand if it were life-saving medicine but not a console."

changemyview,"> But you still haven't provided any evidence of many POC's disliking this, or any evidence of harm being done by the term.

I don't agree with OP, their refusal to engage you fairly, or their offensive terminology.  However I can assure you that I personally know latino people who don't like being lumped in the ""people of color"" category or when Joe Biden started calling them ""brown"" when in reality these people are of all skin colors (latinos include those of white European ancestry and those of African ancestry.)

Additionally, it gets complicated because you have a lot of latinos such as Cubans who generally aren't moved by the immigration debate since they can come to the U.S. and get automatic residency while other latino immigrants can't, or the white upper class Venezuelans who came here leveraging their wealth and have no real love for indigenous or poor latinos (and I've witness this in Mexico as well, where the white people basically run everything and the natives get treated poorly.)  There are also a lot of latinos whose ancestors either are not immigrants at all (e.g. those in the U.S. southwest) or they have no first-hand connection to their ancestors' migration.  Then on the other side there's people like many Dominicans who have very dark skin and get the double-whammy of anti-hispanic AND anti-black bigotry.

So all this is to say that the idea of solidarity under some generic ""people of color"" banner doesn't really work for latinos with other latinos, much less if you start including African-Americans, Asian-Americans, etc. as well.  If you could unify all those groups in a way that they overwhelmingly identify with each other and care for each other I suspect white Americans would also be a part of that utopia.  Instead, we live in a society where people are pitted against each other and are suspicious of each other across racial, class, religious, urban/rural, and other divisions."

For example, he felt that having an equivalent of Air Force One that the Mexican government already owned was too expensive so he filled the news with crazy stories of him trying to get rid of it (because a man of the people would never travel anywhere) and used that to cover up stories of his corruption (like his brother accepting bribes) and his mistakes that have robbed the Mexican people of medicine and child care."

texas,"I think Democrats could easily win Texas and establish a comfortable presence in many other ""red"" states by simply:

1. Drop the focus on guns.  Crime prevention yes, but we don't need people like Beto ruining it for the Democrats that don't want to talk about taking guns away.

2. Focus on the problems of the majority as opposed to the problems of the minority.  That doesn't mean that they need to drop those topics altogether, but it seems like to the Democrats latinos = immigration and blacks = criminal justice reform.  While those topics are important, I think discussing jobs, economics, education, etc. are going to get them more votes.

3. Reframe important issues.  Shift away from, ""stop climate change by any means necessary"" and focus on ""hurricane problems"" and ""creating new jobs in new (green) industries"" and stuff like that.  Pro-choice should be focused primarily on preventing unwanted pregnancies and treat abortion as more of a last resort.

Those three basic steps would probably be a great start for them.  I'd have a much longer list for Republicans, unfortunately."
texas,"So you think the Texas economy could survive without Dallas, Austin, and Houston?  Also on a state level, [California has a higher GDP and fewer people below the poverty line than us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_California).  I don't think there's a huge difference between the two when it comes to corporate philosophy and business though.  There are plenty of good jobs and things in both states and plenty of problems in both.  Obviously I choose to live in Texas and did live in California a short time when I was consulting so I've experienced both states to some degree.  People are moving here because of the cities, not because they want to live in the Permian Basin."

He seems like a corrupt, two-faced piece of shit to me that is responsible for numerous deaths and suffering among other things, but I could see him riding the coattails of the GOP and unjustifiably taking credit for the economic success that private companies brought to the state."
texas,"> I'd love to see your stats that show Californians are coming to Texas and voting republican because the exact opposite is cited for one of the major reasons Texas is becoming more liberal.

I suspect the Californians moving here are people who work and tend to be focused on business.  As a result, a lot of the Republicans coming from California aren't going to be opposed to stuff like legalizing weed or implementing policies supporting profitable renewable energy companies.  However, they would still tend to vote Republican because they want economic policies that favor the wealthy or at least upper middle class in some way.

I have no idea what percentage of Californians are like that versus the stereotypical liberal Californians but I've met both kinds.  None of them tend to be the weird religious zealot types you run into in rural areas (especially East Texas) though."
texas,"> The the liberals in Dallas, Austin, and Houston are not the majority, just the most vocal online.

The liberals in these cities are also the ones working hard and bringing all the money to the state, so you'd think that Abbott would show us a little more respect once in a while even if we didn't vote for him."

AskAnAmerican,"Same in Texas.  Tamales are just a thing that bridges all ethnic groups in states that border Mexico.  Here in Texas (pre-COVID) you would have some contact with a lady that sells tamales or if you're in a business like a hardware store there might be some lady pulling around a cooler that you can buy from.  Once I was even in Guitar Center and a tamal lady randomly came in and I bought some off of her.

politics,"I grew up in a Christian cult and basically left because of seeds of doubt on topics such as: 1) I loved science fiction and science, and some of the stuff we were taught clearly didn't line up with the evidence that was presented through scientific means, 2) it bugged me how our beliefs were essentially misogynist and it bothered me that my mother was considered a second-class citizen, and 3) I saw abuse and flip-flopping in the doctrine of our religious leadership.  Being raised in it, I took what they said 100% literally and tried to understand it through logic and was confused when I found contradictions either between what they said and the Bible or what they said and what they previously said.

After I left (which took a long time because I thought my family would completely cut me out of their lives in line with the church policy) my siblings had it less strict and basically left, and my parents moved due to the job situation and while the cult was still in the city they moved to, the people were different and they had less connection with them.  As a result, they slowly bowed out from the cult as well.

All is not necessarily happy though.  My parents were completely on-board the Sarah Palin train and apparently even met her, and are obviously all in on Trump right now.  My siblings are more normal but a mixed bag as well.  This makes me somewhat pessimistic that a lot of these people who will eventually ""leave"" the Trump cult will join whatever comes along next, no matter how terrible it is.  I do think a lot of fans of Trump will be done with him sometime next year but the mentality that brought them into his influence will still be there and easily exploitable."
gaming,"Here's another way to see it. If I budget $700 for my initial console purchase, does the manufacturer makes more money if I dump all of that into buying let's say a digital PS5 console second hand where Sony makes $399, of would it be better for them if I bought an extra controller and one or two games at the same time? They do lose money to scalpers even if it's difficult to have good statistics on."
PS5,"I'm still trying to avoid a long rant, but basically you have a problem of scale on all sides:

1. Corporations like Fedex are huge, and the people at the top literally only have metrics and statistics to make their decisions from.  In many corporations of this type, the people in charge are often people whose careers have focused on running businesses as opposed to the core business that their company delivers.  There's just a huge disconnect in several areas between company management, the employee base, and customers.

2. Most stockholders are similar to to the management in this case but often worse.  While there are specific investors and fund managers at investment firms that pay attention to the accounting details at least of the company, the majority of people who own stock do so passively often through a retirement account that has a mix of funds.  As a result, the stockholders might be only slightly aware that they own stock in a specific company.  These stockholders just want to see a personal rate of return on their 401K or IRA accounts that keeps going up.

3. Consumers have no idea what's involved, they just want to pay money and receive a product without putting any additional thought into it.  At this point we've all heard stories of people jumping off roofs at Foxcon factories in China that make consumer electronics, we've all heard stories of Amazon workers in their warehouses and delivery trucks keeping piss bottles so they avoid bathroom breaks.  Many of us are even aware of other problems such as sustainability or worker abuse but it's nearly impossible to avoid as a consumer.  As an example, I recently had some expensive perfume shipped from France so I could give it to my wife for Christmas and I started looking into the ingredients.  There were at least two ingredients in it that I wasn't fully aware of but investigated and cause moral problems for me (one being a scent that comes from some type of infection in an endangered tree, the other being animal cruelty.)  It's just very difficult to be a moral person as a consumer in this day and age when so much is hidden and our choice boils down to just what product can we get for what price.

All that being said, this being the PS5 subreddit I wanted to avoid going into too long of a critique of modern civilization and our version of a market-based economy, but I don't have my PS5 yet and it's not supposed to arrive until December 1st so I need something to occupy my time (although on a side note I already received my Nintendo Game and Watch celebrating the 35th anniversary of Mario, which I am enjoying.)"
PS5,"> I worked as a delivery driver for years at most of the big name companies, and if only stock holders and investors could understand that having a work life balance for the working class is paramount for a company's stability.

I could go into a whole long spiel about this, but that's just not how the system works, sadly.  Also think of stockholders not as the rich guys controlling everything, but the majority of stockholders being random people that you know that passively have retirement funds."
PS5,"I had this problem with Amazon when the XBox One X came out.  I was able to order one from them as well as Target, and the Target one did make it (I forget who the carrier was) but I'm pretty sure that this is an unfortunately common issue.

AskReddit,"Pre-Netflix and Pre-Redbox.  I probably could have done this and made a lot of money but was too lazy/discouraged to try.

A pizza delivery business that also rents out movies.  Basically, each pizza delivery vehicle would have a selection of let's say the top 20 most popular movies (in multiples of each depending on the rank) available to rent so when you call in your pizza order you also say which movie you want of what is available.  So you have pizza and a movie night without needing to drive somewhere.  Part of the deal would also be an option to drop off the movie in person within the next two days for a discount on your next order, or we would pick up the movie from your home a week later for free.

There's more details I put into the thoughts of it but that's basically the gist at a high level.  I came up with this idea in the 90's."

Arcade1Up,"I don't think most shooters would be appropriate for the earliest elementary years, and even BBH might be too much if they cried while watching Bambi for example.  You give the example of Duck Hunt but it was so cartoonish that it would not be a problem.

So I don't have any options that come to mind for Arcade1Up, but I own an original NES and have a CRT that my kids occasionally use to play Duck Hunt.  I also have a Playstation 2 and can do Time Crisis 2 but that's definitely not little kid friendly.  I'm waiting for my order for a Sinden light gun to come in and I'm going to set it up with my Raspberry Pi and test it out, maybe put it in an Arcade1Up cabinet if it works well, although I suspect the small screen won't be as challenging."
PS5,Sony could potentially encourage opt-in as well by offering people who send information access to get either beta or release candidate updates before the official release occurs too.
news,"While that's true, I've also known a lot of highly intelligent people whose intelligence makes them more deeply delusional.  A historical example of this would be Sir Isaac Newton.  The guy wasted way too much of his genius on religious nonsense and alchemy.  I've also known some many mentally simpler people who are also good despite not having any deep understanding of anything.  I can't give any historical examples of this because of obvious reasons but for a fictional example I'd say someone like George Bailey from It's a Wonderful Life."
nes,Wow!  This brings back childhood memories of going to my friend's house on a Friday night and sitting on some beanbags in front of a tiny screen like this to play Double Dragon 3 or whatever NES game we rented from the local store for a while before we get pizza and watch a scary movie or a something about ninjas that we also rented.
news,Many of us reasonable people come from people who have the types of views everyone is crapping on here (and I'm no exception despite having evangelicals and other magic thinkers in my family.)  Passing traits in natural selection is based on genetics and I don't think there's generally any genetic factor to denial of reality.  Human thought and ideas tend to be external rather than passed on through your family meaning anyone could become delusional or those descended from delusional people can be rational.
changemyview,"I don't think your view can be completely changed, but I would argue that there's a difference between these two scenarios:

1. All people of a certain race are people that I would never date under any circumstance.

2. I tend to prefer a specific race over others.

Scenario 1 would likely be racist, while scenario 2 is just a preference.  A rewording of scenario 1 would be to incorporate an openness of scenario 2 into it in such a way that there could be exceptions.  Something more like, ""I tend to prefer a specific race over others and haven't met someone from another race that I felt attracted to.""  It is less racist to judge on a case by case basis than to immediately say ""no"" before seeing them.

Another factor that you touched on was this:

> These preferences or standards are not assigned to bigotry but rather tastes outside our control. Attraction does not exist in a vacuum, and our tastes (be it in sex, food, art) are almost never down to choice.

I would argue that this is not completely true.  I agree that we have innate preferences that play a factor, but society-driven bigotry is also a factor.  Consider these two stereotypes of women by race:

* Black women are overweight, loud, and angry.

* Asian women are thin, quiet, and submissive.

In reality neither of these statements would reflect the reality of how diverse each categorization is.  I assume you wouldn't consider Halle Berry to be overweight, loud, and angry.  What about Margaret Cho as representing Asian women by being thin and quiet?  We are often passively fed stereotypes and that paints our impressions of people before we meet them.  As a result, we often associate positive and negative things with certain skin colors subconsciously.  I don't think we can easily quantify how much that factors in versus the innate preferences we have.  There's certainly nothing in our DNA that tells us to prefer a specific skin color over another, as we do have with hetero or homo sexuality."
StrangerThings,"Hopefully in the new season we'll see what a ""sibling"" relationship between El and Will ends up being like and if there is conflict, it should be resolved."
AskAnAmerican,"To some degree yes.  Others have focused on the similarities but I'll instead focus on what is different.

Basically, the biggest difference I see is the general life of a thing.  There aren't many food establishments or bars that are consistent through generations in the U.S.  The types of bars and such that we go to here come and go frequently, and as a result they tend to not develop the same level of culture that you'd have in the U.K.  The place you hang out now is likely to not be the same place you go to five years from now, and as a result the regulars will often split to various new places.

Secondly, there are areas of the U.S. where alcohol is not socially acceptable, and even if it is they often view it as a bad thing to drink outside of certain circumstances.  If you're a family man for example, people might thing poorly of you if you go out for drinks with your friends every Friday night.  If you're an evangelical Christian, you likely avoid alcohol too and look down on people that drink (I even heard an evangelical friend say that Jesus didn't turn water into wine, but rather grape juice.)  As a result, you see places like Starbucks or other coffee shops fill the niche of the pub in some circles.

Finally, business is much more cut-throat in the U.S. than in the U.K.  There's a restaurant I like that will charge you extra if you sit at a table more than an hour.  Waiters at restaurants will drop the bill off at your table without asking to give you the hint that you should leave once you're done with your food.  Bars function differently because you have to go up to place an order, but they find other ways to inconvenience you so you don't hang out too long when you're done ordering drinks.  These often take the form of a lack of seating, loud music preventing you from talking with friends, etc.

So all this isn't to say that pubs don't exist in the U.S., they clearly do, but they aren't anywhere near as popular as in the U.K.  My opinion is that coffee shops fit the niche of a place to hang out and catch up with friends much more frequently.  Another factor may be our housing as well.  I'm not as sure how it works in the U.K. but if it's anything like Ireland you don't have big houses and nice enough weather to have outdoor functions on the same level as much of the U.S. does.  Americans tend to be much more capable of having an environment to invite a large group of friends over for events.  I often have 20-30 people over for Thanksgiving (not this year) and it's not unusual for me to have 50+ if it's an event in my back yard."
RedditForGrownups,"It's ""COVID normal"" but during other times it's not normal.  That's not to say that all of those people died from COVID, you didn't say, but that has been the biggest factor with the uptick in deaths and hospitalizations I've observed in my own life.  I've also seen people who temporarily lost their service industry jobs indirectly due to COVID go back to being drug addicts so that may be another factor than just the disease."
AskAnAmerican,I've spent some time in downtown San Francisco and a lot of time in downtown Houston.  I would say that I really like the general bay area and some stuff in San Francisco is nice.  I would also say that all big cities in the country are more similar than they are dissimilar.  I've had to walk around homeless people laying on the ground tripping or have to avoid literal shit and piss on the sidewalks on a regular basis.  There's a place I go for breakfast tacos that hoses the front of their restaurant off every morning because it's a hobo latrine for some reason.

Futurology,I already work with brilliant people from India and China though. We just pay them to come to the U.S. and their skills end up serving the needs of the people here and they spend their income here. A big part of that is that they *want* to live in the U.S.
Futurology,"I'm saying that there's a much cheaper cost of living there so theoretically companies could employ people there.  I've heard good things about the University of Montana too.  However, like most places, the best people for office work tend to migrate to big cities over time.

To put it simply, if you're looking for a software developer you're going to find higher quality ones in big cities as opposed to the middle of nowhere.  Lots of us lived in small towns before but went where they jobs are, which feed the cycle.  While the WFH trend may make a difference to some degree, the people working in high tech are still going to congregate in certain areas even if they leave the big cities.  You can't just outsource jobs to random people no matter what the credentials are.  I've worked for several Fortune 500 companies and most outsource either badly or just repetitive stuff.  I've also played around with AI some (such as using IBM Watson to build a chatbot with Microsoft Teams to mimic a service desk person) and it's more likely to replace mundane stuff faster than things that require more thought -- meaning that AI is going to replace outsourceable jobs first."
Futurology,It's all about the quality of work. There's a reason why certain jobs haven't been moved to cheaper places like Montana within the U.S. too.

AskAnAmerican,"I may not have stated this clearly enough but I don't mean that Rousseau was specifically in line with all of modern libertarianism (which might be closer to anarchism), but he idealized less advanced societies and focused on individuals acting in accordance with their own self interests.  For example, take this quote and tell me it wouldn't fit in on some libertarian subreddit:

> “I have never thought, for my part, that man's freedom consists in his being able to do whatever he wills, but that he should not, by any human power, be forced to do what is against his will.”

In my view, on a purely philosophical level, Rousseau seemed to be mostly focused on individual rights and not on collectivism.  Yes, he did suggest that societies play a part in the lives of people but at least from what I've read that's not the primary thing he focuses on.  It's been years since I've read much about him but my understanding is that he was not too keen on advanced societies like ours currently is because they would result in limits being applied to individual rights.  I think he was kind of naive when it came to the standards he held the average person to, expecting them to be more capable of curiosity, intelligence, and self-control than reality.  That being said, it has been years since I've read anything from him so maybe I've missed his point or maybe I misunderstand what libertarian represents based on conversations with one friend who claims to be libertarian.

In terms of the cancel culture topic, some of the people being canceled *are* in the categories of obvious bigots.  Some may not be, but I also haven't heard of any situations where someone was ""canceled"" through means that are problematic (that doesn't mean I don't think it could happen, but I've mostly heard about actual bigots being canceled or someone like Ben Shapiro.)  This is probably an improvement over my college days because I remember the school tolerating people on campus screaming at us telling us we're going to Hell and such.  This was actually at a private school with a religious origin although it's a mainstream secular school at this time (sorry for being vague.)  If the pendulum has swung too far toward censoring people, then it's better to seek balance as opposed to stopping all forms of ""cancellation."""

AskAnAmerican,"> Government regulation of most industry, consumer choice, and all other manner of regulations are hard wired into the general liberal policy.

This is only a problem if the government is somehow authoritarian and not beholden to the people.  The point of a liberal democracy is for the government to act as an arbiter between all the people and to balance power differentials in a way that prevents the more powerful from inflicting harm on the less powerful.  I won't argue that the U.S. government is necessarily set up in this way currently, but it's the goal of social liberals to protect the less powerful.

> It is just a Rousseauian remaking of society so that government can be the impetus for man's meaning.

I would argue that Rousseau was closer to libertarianism or something else than what modern liberalism wants.  To go with something less philosophical, I think the end game of modern liberalism is more in line with the reality of Star Trek -- where food is not scarce and people are free to pursue their interests and contribute to society *collectively* as opposed to a more individual-focused idea like what Rousseau wrote about.

> Even look at woke/PC/cancel culture. There are certain ideas or discussion that must not be had.

Look at this another way -- if you worked as a bank teller and you went on all day about how great Robin Hood is and how stealing from the rich to give to the poor is completely justified and you wish there was a modern day Robin Hood, should your boss consider you suspicious?  There are definitely lines of thought that are suspect enough that they should not be entertained, although what that means will vary from one group to another.  Some of the things people are ""canceled"" for are basically that they reject the humanity of other people.  I don't think it's productive to force black people to hear speeches from neo-nazis or for homosexuals to have people showing up on campus for protestant evangelicals to scream at them while holding signs calling for their deaths.  I think you would agree that some ""cancel culture"" is necessary, but perhaps you might draw the line somewhere differently than another person would."
AskAnAmerican,"Don't even look at it on a state level.  If you get more granular, you'll see that on a county level, even within red states, [Democratic areas contribute at least 70% to the GDP](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/11/09/biden-voting-counties-equal-70-of-americas-economy-what-does-this-mean-for-the-nations-political-economic-divide/).  I have family in deeply red areas but live in the fourth largest city in the U.S. myself, and there's many differences between people in urban and rural areas.

Speaking mainly of my family, I have to say that there's a huge sense of entitlement and a lot of rage about their impotence in life.  These people saw their parents and grandparents have decent lives out in the boonies based on the successes of post WWII era America.  My grandparents' generation were able to make a living off of basically shit jobs and still buy houses, have a lot of leisure time, and live comfortably.  The boomers in my family had less, and as they got older most of them lost their manual labor jobs (which several of them would show up to work drunk anyway) and on government benefits.  They still think they're hard working or that they already put in their fair share and expect to have as good of a retirement as their parents.  

People my age or younger basically made the decision to leave if they wanted to be successful.  Those that stuck around in their small towns either became drug addicts or religious zealots -- sometimes even going back and forth between the two.  Those of us that are successful often were exposed to different ethnicities, religions, more education, etc. and developed different morals and life philosophies than those that stayed in the small towns.

All that being said, it's a pretty miserable experience going to visit family in these run down small towns.  People are far unhealthier than I would see where I live.  People get angry at the drop of the hat if you talk about the wrong thing or disagree with them on something.  If it's politics or religion, you can be sure you're going to hear a long rant about it and you're not allowed to disagree.  What bothers me probably the most is the lack of curiosity.  I'm a dual citizen and have been in many different countries, but my experiences pale in comparison to what they've seen in movies or on their biased ""news"" sources which are often just Facebook.  I've encouraged younger people to pursue education and a good career but their elders often have a crabs in a bucket attitude and try to pull them down.  Yes, I love my family and miss them but if I ever moved to where they live I'd be depressed and consider myself a failure in some way.  

That being said as judgmental as I am coming across here I would never say something like that in their presence.  I always try to encourage what good things they're doing and to ask questions about their lives and show interest because I think it's important for family to do that.  However, it's getting harder as I see these people spouting hate and calling for war against their fellow Americans just because of their political ideas."

AskAnAmerican,"> Or those shows about how everyone's dream is to move to NYC/LA? Nah, people have very different takes.

It makes sense though.  A movie where the protagonist lives in a small town and wants to just grow up to take over his dad's lawncare business in that same small town, eat hamburgers once per week, and marry a nice girl from down the street that goes to the same church would likely be extremely boring.

I know other people whose paperwork has been lost and it screwed them over for a while as well.

AskAnAmerican,I quoted what I did because there's nuance and based on the op/ed I don't think Robert Gates has the same view on Biden as he did in 2014.
AskAnAmerican,"> and just leaves the world alone.

This is not a good idea.  Trump's strategy created a power vacuum that other countries, especially China, have rushed in to fill.  The progress China has made with getting Latin America on their side while Trump was busy calling them ""rapists and murderers"" should be unsettling for Americans that don't want a nation running massive concentration camps and ruled by an authoritarian hanging out with our neighbors telling them how much we suck."
AskAnAmerican,"You're painting an incomplete picture.  In a [Wall Street Journal op/ed](https://www.mediaite.com/election-2020/obama-defsec-gates-praises-biden-in-response-to-wsj-ed-board-quoting-him-saying-biden-has-gotten-foreign-policy-wrong-for-four-decades/) (I linked to a non-paywall source rather than the original) Gates said:

> While it is certainly fair to quote my criticisms of Joe Biden’s record on national security, fairness requires me to note for the record that those comments written in 2014 also noted that **Mr. Biden was a man of genuine integrity and character**. It is also worth noting that I wrote in these very pages that **Donald Trump “is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief**”

So I think your statement doesn't accurately reflect how Robert Gates feels about Biden.  I know you didn't mention Trump but it seems clear that as much as Gates may have disagreed with Biden on foreign policy, he viewed Trump's foreign policy as much worse."
AskAnAmerican,"> Creators won’t create things if they aren’t granted recognition nor monetary compensation.

I think the ""compensation"" at this point is the continued existence of modern society.  While I would hope that anyone who contributes to make the world a better place is rewarded in ways that improves their lives directly as well, I think most people who do good things do it because it's right.

That being said, the biggest risk in opposition to this view is that companies won't invest R&D money for things that are likely to be stolen, and that's the advantage of having IP laws.  However, even with strong IP laws a lot of those ideas are going to be stolen regardless so I don't think there's a point to arguing about whether the idea is stolen by China or not.  Anything that can be developed for any purpose already can be stolen by them and a lot of things are.  This would just be the status quo."

changemyview,"I mean I don't believe much of the bible is plausible and I don't know how a mixture of dust, water, and flour would be an abortifacient but if we take it at face value it's literally saying that you can follow this process to induce a miscarriage if the woman cheated.  How else can this be interpreted?"
changemyview,"Perhaps the person you responded to would have been better to say, ""Jesus was non-partisan.""  However, I would also argue that we don't really know all that much about the real Jesus, if it was one person, or even if he actually existed in any capacity.  So referring to the gospels as evidence of the views of the biblical Jesus as a historical document is insufficient in either case."
changemyview,Read [Numbers 5:11-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%205%3A11-31&version=NIV).  The context is basically that it's ok to do an abortion in the event that a wife has been unfaithful.

AskReddit,"I lost a grandfather recently too, but unfortunately in my case sometime went to visit my grandparents and got them sick. You have my sympathy."
houston,They dude probably got scared of the fawns at the petting zoo.
houston,"> So yeah there was a blue wave, but there was also a red wave.

I can't find it now but I saw a graph charting voter participation over the years.  I don't know if there's any scientific backing to this concept but at least off the top of my head it looked like periods with increased voter participation functioned as a leading indicator to social unrest.  For example, we haven't seen turnout as higher as we've seen in 2020 since just prior to the Civil War.  I plan to investigate this further but to have two divergent and highly energized groups opposing each other certainly can't be good."
RedditForGrownups,"As others have pointed out, there's definitely a change as you age.  In particular, you consider personality and such more than when you're around 20.  Physical beauty still matters but you give more weight to other factors.

That being said, having crossed over into the fourth decade I do see a difference if I were to see pictures of classmates on Facebook.  Some women are still attractive and they are youthful looking.  Some look older than I feel is right for their age and it's shocking and unattractive.  That latter perspective applies to the men as well -- not from an attraction standpoint but to see someone from high school sporting a big white beard and it's confusing and kind of weird to me.

On the younger side of the spectrum, I will admit that I could easily still find a 20 year old girl physically attractive, but I don't think a relationship with one would work out.  We'd just have different life experiences and be in different stages.  I wouldn't say it was impossible but it would be very unlikely."

houston,Keep in mind that Medium is essentially a blog site.
CasualConversation,Yep.  OP's grandmother is a part of them -- both literally in terms of genetics but also in life experiences that they shared together.
VoteBlue,"> I don't want to say they are callous, but the number of deaths really doesn't hit some people.

When my grandfather died a couple weeks back, all the Trump supporters in the family made excuses about pre-existing conditions and such.  The same thing when my great aunt died the week before.  For some reason, they're not ready to admit that someone died from COVID even when it impacts them directly."
changemyview,"I'm sympathetic to your view but I think there are a few arguments against what you're saying:

1. Biden has received more votes than anyone in history for U.S. president.  He's outperformed Clinton in many areas.  Overall, voter turnout has been extremely high in this election.  As a result, I see no indication that a significant segment of people stayed home and refused to vote.

2. Given the demographics that Biden did poorly in, it seems like some of the propaganda against him that painted him as a socialist worked in those places.  Cuban Americans, for example, seem to have not been as enthusiastic about Biden as expected.  I would even extend this to Mexican Americans, who may have family in Mexico who are suffering under AMLO who claims to be left-wing but is a very Trump-like populist (except he claims to come from poor people as opposed to being a rich guy.)  As a result, I suspect if Bernie had been the nominee, the numbers among the voters susceptible to concerns of ""socialism"" would have been even worse.

3. The main point you're not discussing is outside of who supports the Democrats.  Despite all the ""Lincoln Project"" types who get media attention, Trump was and still is very popular with Republicans.  Biden probably pulled in some independents who voted for Trump in 2016, but those that strongly identify as Republicans are still very much on board with Trump.  These people would not be convinced by either a moderate like Biden or someone more to the left like Bernie.  I don't have an alternative for how the Democrats can reach these voters, but going further left will definitely not convince them because they already don't agree with left-wing policies.  Even the policies you mentioned like drug bills aren't things that the right focuses on anymore, so they don't mind it.  Additionally, it isn't something that would raise taxes, constrain their religion, force education or safety on them, or anything like that, so they don't immediately oppose it.  

Ultimately I feel like 1) Biden got as many votes as any Democrat could from the left-wing base, 2) a more left-wing candidate would have gotten less votes due to ""socialism"", and 3) most Trump voters are unreachable by Democrats."
Futurology,"> I was reading an article about how the media will handle any premature announcements of victory by Trump.

He's been doing that since yesterday."
nes,"Atari 2600:  Atari

Game Boy:  Game Boy

Sega Genesis:  Sega or Genesis (we didn't know about the Master System I guess.)

SNES:  Super Nintendo

I think the Sega Genesis was when we stopped referring to consoles as being the company name."
news,"There's a good ""Behind the Bastards"" podcast from a few weeks back that discussed this topic.  The majority of national socialists weren't even all that hateful of race, the majority were focused on economics and merely tolerated the racist and autocratic elements of the movement because they felt it wouldn't impact them personally.  Most of them were fairly middle class people as well.  The poorer people were more likely to be actual socialists."
changemyview,"My point is that if the parties had to appeal to a larger segment of the population by basing things off an average American rather than the wonky way the EC works, their policies would basically be forced to be more centrist.  Both rural and urban areas are polarized in different ways, but that's also because the two parties aren't directly competing for those areas as much as competing to rile up their base and try to reduce voting in their opposing areas."
changemyview,"Except that neither party has policies or opinions that are set in stone.  If we had a more fair electoral process, you would see both parties start to cater more towards the center instead of disparate urban/rural voters."

politics,"> As far as I can tell whenever we get a COVID vaccine taking it will be as politicized as everything else about the pandemic has been.

If Biden wins, there would be most likely bipartisan support for people to get the vaccine.  Republicans will want people to get vaccinated so they can go out and spend money, Democrats will want people to get vaccinated to save lives.  While there will be some conspiracy theorists that refuse vaccination, I would hope that most people will get it."
politics,It's literally false news being circulated on Twitter.
politics,"> I'll probably go outside and sniff flower or shit for 30 minutes.

I'm trying to parse what you're saying.  Is it that you will (sniff flower) or (shit(verb)), or is it that you will sniff (flower or shit(noun))?"
NoStupidQuestions,Yeah.  I found [this Youtube video telling you how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3NGBo2M1Ps) but there are others as well.
houston,"> I do a lot of animal rescue work and I can tell you that you will probably find it difficult right now to try and rehome your cat. Rescues and shelters are full (as they always are).

I haven't looked for a while but are they making it easier to adopt pets from any of the shelters now?  In the past I've looked into it and it seemed too intrusive where they want to come look at your house and do some sort of intrusive background check.  I would think that the type of people who are going to be abusive towards pets or end up returning them would be in the minority and it would be better to adopt out the pets than to put them down."
CasualConversation,Did we just find Ezra Klein's reddit account?
CasualConversation,The same thing applies though.  It's not like the current president has some grand intellect and has done great things for the country.  The COVID crisis is the most perfect example of how incompetent he is.
CasualConversation,"> As someone who leans towards T, we can't believe why someone would want Biden/Kamala.

To give you as succinct of an explanation as I can, the Obama years were better than the last four (and especially this year) in our opinions.  I don't think anyone is thrilled with Biden/Harris but in comparison to T they seem far better.  Some of the reasons many of us oppose T are due to his corruption, his lack of effort to mitigate COVID, his family separation/forced sterilization policies, his standing in the way of addressing climate change, etc.  I think I literally only know of one person who actually wanted Biden to be the nominee, but he's fairly stable and mainstream and would offer respite from the insanity and decline of the past four years."
VoteBlue,"Yep.  It got pretty frustrating with COVID because I had to correct some friends who lean Democratic on several occasions.  They saw on Facebook that ""Democrats were blocking Trump from passing a COVID stimulus bill"" but when I explained that the Democrats passed a bill in the House in May and the Republicans were blocking it and refusing to negotiate it just caused confusion.  I think the winner is whoever gets information out there first, whether it's true or not.  If that's how it works, that's extremely dangerous for society."
politics,"I mostly agree with you but I think the experience varies based on a lot of factors.  If you're well dressed, driving a normal car, and with skin tone typical of northern Mexico you're going to be treated differently than if you're with strong native features and skin tone, driving a more run down car, and wearing working class clothes.  The latter is much more likely to have bad experiences with police than a well-spoken middle class white guy from Sonora who gets pulled over rarely and the cop doesn't even know he's latino until he sees the driver's license.

All that aside, you're 100% right about the importance of empathy and common sense, and that people also overestimate how ""special"" they are.  My point though was mostly that people who lack empathy in Mexico are going to be the same when they come to the U.S.  There's no real sense of latino pride or Mexican unity or whatever, there's the class structure there and it carries over to the U.S. in some form when people migrate."
politics,"It's not like everyone in Mexico has the same experience though, and that experience colors what their thoughts are when they come to the U.S. as well.  A Mexican family that enters the U.S. lawfully because they have college degrees and get high paying jobs with TN visas and whatnot will have very little in common with a Mexican family from a drug cartel controlled impoverished area of Mexico that came here illegally to work under the table jobs."
NoStupidQuestions,"Reality TV are designed for specific demographics, and the demographic that these types of shows are targeting tend to be Boomer/Gen X white guys that are interested in more blue collar type pursuits such as rebuilding cars.  So they play music that would be popular with these people on the shows.

On a side note, if you also pay attention to the commercials (assuming you are watching live TV) you can also determine the target demographics much more easily."
VoteBlue,"It's not such a simple thing.  The Democrats weren't competing with GOP policies or people taking an educated, logical view of the plans of each party and judging them on their merits.  No, the Democrats were competing with caricatures of them on Facebook, Twitter, Nextdoor, WhatsApp, and others.  Lies spread much faster than the truth, and most people are extremely gullible.

Look at COVID specifically.  People got upset enough to take up arms against their leaders when Democrats tried to temporarily implement plans to save lives like wearing masks.  This isn't a fight to be won in the political arena, we have a serious problem with the spread of misinformation and how gullible so many people are."
houston,"Yep, if you look at Fort Bend related Facebook groups and Nextdoor, the amount of racism against Kulkarni is pretty bad."
AskAnAmerican,"The enthusiasm on both sides isn't driven by a love for their candidate as much as a revulsion of the other party and their candidate.  Democrats are obviously anti-Trump, and you could argue that Biden would beat him by being more moderate.  You could also argue that Biden beat Bernie, Warren, etc. by being more moderate.  

However, the exit polls that I've seen aren't really in line with that narrative.  Democrats voted against Trump rather than for Biden, and picked from a list of things that Trump has done to justify it such as COVID, exacerbating racism, etc.  Republicans voted against what they felt a Biden administration would cause -- a Democratic party pushing for socialism, chaos in the streets due to racial violence, etc.  If you look at those sentences, none of them indicate voters say, ""I think my candidate will do the best job and has a great vision for the future.""  Americans are in a position of being afraid of each other forcing negative things on the other side and not really looking toward a shared future.  This is the root problem."
AskAnAmerican,"That's one possible lesson but I kind of don't think so.  I expect that the grassroots from both sides will get more extreme.  Social media is probably what I see as the biggest cause for the divisiveness right now, partially because it allows people to enter information bubbles but also partially because of how easy it is for fake information to spread around or real information to be exaggerated and blown up to places that it wouldn't have otherwise."
AskAnAmerican,"The thing is I usually get a four day weekend due to Thanksgiving.  We have a nice big artificial tree so it makes sense to put it up that weekend and be done with it.

If we used a natural tree it might wait until later, because despite watering and putting whatever chemicals we're told to, natural trees seem to dry out way too quickly and leave needles everywhere.  Plus a nice sized natural tree would go for over $100 where I live."
AskAnAmerican,"I've done some analysis and I think the exact opposite will happen.  The turnout is amazing when it comes to the idea of more Americans participating in Democracy, but the last time we've had turnout this high was in the lead to the most polarized America has ever been -- the U.S. Civil War.

I'm not saying that we're going to see another civil war, but that I believe the high turnout and closeness of the race is direct evidence of how polarized we are."
AskAnAmerican,"I don't know for Twitter, but the more respectable news sources get their numbers from specific state and county officials.  Usually it's posted on their websites but in some cases they will have reporters standing outside of where the counts are being done and get occasional updates from officials that way."
AskAnAmerican,"I don't see it as being as complicated as all that.  If you take a date to their house to leave them there, what does the method of transportation matter?  If you live in a big city with public transportation or if you merely walk them home, you're still ""dropping them off"" by ensuring they get home safely.  Even if it's a double date and your friend is the driver instead of you it's the same deal."
RedditForGrownups,"It's too close to call at this point, but I believe OP was hoping for a clear repudiation of Trump as opposed to how close it currently is."
travel,The main reason I suggest them is mostly the kid-friendly part as well.  There's a lot of activities because of the resorts and it would be cool to swim with a dolphin or go swimming in a cenote at those ages.
changemyview,"> when a political party loses said election which had a low amount of voter turnout, they are incentivised by their own self-interest to change things up and appeal the voters who didn't like either of the previous candidates.

There is no indication this is what has ever happened as far as I can tell."
travel,"I would definitely search around the Yucatan because the Pacific coast can have rougher waters in general.  Personally, I'm a fan of Playa del Carmen although you'll want to look for a nice resort there if that's your plan.  There are also smaller places you can rent around Tulum to have a whole house to yourself if you prefer that over a resort.  The only bad thing is that there really isn't much culture to speak of in the Yucatan in general.  It's sort of like the Mexican version of Las Vegas in that regard and is mostly faked or exaggerated from other parts of the country.  However, if you want culture like museums and such you'd likely not go on a beach trip, except for seeing some Mayan ruins like at Tulum."
AskAnAmerican,"I want my kids to be good moral people and think for themselves.  If they disagree with me on stuff, including politics, that's up to them.  Their spouse only factors into it if they treat them badly."
AskAnAmerican,"I have a similar opinion after working there on a contract for nearly a year.  It was an ok place, but nothing exciting and nothing I hated at the same time.  I think there are a few things that go against Columbus:

1. It doesn't have a specific industry that it has been built around that is prominent.

2. It has no major important role in history.

3. It lacks interesting topology or natural sights.

Despite all that, it is a very ok place, and the lack of the things above have perhaps helped keep wages and the cost of living low enough that it has been able to grow while flying under the radar."
politics,"I don't know where you live or where your wife is from (if she's even an immigrant) but there's a huge variety of people under the latino umbrella group.  A lot of the latino Trump supporters do so because of machisimo and the indignation that he spouts resonates with them.  Cuban-American and Venezuelan-American latinos sometimes also support him because of his tough talk against Cuba and Venezuela and the fear of socialism.  On the other hand, Biden has done a pretty poor job with latino outreach, so the situation there hasn't really improved as much as it should have.  While we're all supporting him in my family and friends group, his talk of ""brown"" voters and acting like all latinos in America are impoverished hasn't helped when there are so many of all skin tones and income levels."
AskReddit,"> Half the time im annoyed with my stupid teammate for doing something moronic and giving up multiple goals.
> 
> The other half, i am the stupid teammate.


This is how I feel as well.  However, given how laggy the servers are I also give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they're experiencing lag even if the game doesn't indicate it.  I've been on far too many games myself where I start experiencing lag and the game doesn't indicate it, but ten seconds later the lag icons are flashing at the top right side and my teammates and opponents seem to be unaffected."
houston,"> Are you aware that HPD has an entire department dedicated toward homeless outreach? All the cops in that department do is build relationships with homeless people, help them find shelter, and give them opportunities to get jobs.

Do they dress in a standard police uniform with a badge?  If so, that's likely part of the problem."
changemyview,"Technically there's a lot of overlap between socialist and market based economies.  Consider these examples:

1. A communist society where the government appoints a board of people to oversee a factory.

2. A capitalist society where the government approvers the corporate charter and regulates the private corporation that oversees a factory.

In both cases, the business is ultimately beholden to the government.  In the U.S., the government has broken up monopolies, shut down businesses, and made all sorts of rules that could help or harm those corporations.  As a result, these two options aren't necessarily very different, depending entirely on how responsive the government is to the people, how stable it is, etc.

Now consider two other options:

1. An authoritarian society where the dictator appoints his brother to oversee a factory.

2. A plutocratic society where the people in charge hold fake elections and give the appearance of a fair market-based economy but in reality put a corrupt person that siphons money to them in charge of a factory.

You could sort of group together both option 1's and option 2's.  However, there's a huge degree of difference as well.  As a result, I personally believe that the quality of the government is the most important factor, even beyond how the economy is structured.  That's why I personally find the argument over socialism vs. capitalism to be a distraction.  It's even worse when what is being discussed is Nordic-style ""socialism"" which basically just means that the government does more to help people than the U.S. does."
AskAnAmerican,"Prior to the 2016 election I was fairly active posting there and apparently didn't break rules.  Someone asked me if I'd be interested and to fill out the application so I did and was admitted.  It's not bad, and for as much time as I spend on reddit it's nice to give back by cleaning it up a bit.  Most people on reddit would be disappointed by how mundane it is, and there's fairly high turnover.  As big of a deal as it seems on reddit, at the end of the day it's just the same type of cleanup and such that you do on any other subreddit."
AskAnAmerican,"I suspect it's similar to moderating most places including here, just that the volume of stuff to deal with is that much higher."
AskAnAmerican,"I think the odds are in the favors of those votes being counted, but the fact that there's a possibility of them being thrown out is a very shitty situation."
AskAnAmerican,"I think the goal from the Republicans is to not have a ruling today, but to have those ballots thrown out after the election is over if possible."
AskAnAmerican,I think the longer the election drags on the greater the chance of violence.  If there is a clear winner by Friday or earlier (I'm picking that arbitrarily) then I think it won't get too bad.
AskAnAmerican,"It's much worse than that.  Harris County went to the state to get approval to conduct in-person voting in curbside tents, got the approval, then let people vote that way.  An activist lawyer is trying to claim that it was unconstitutional to allow this.  As much as it seems like obvious B.S., it has a chance of screwing up the votes of those individuals because there are Trump-nominees involved with the process in federal court.

I think you might be mixing up this with the governor closing down all the dropoff boxes for mail-in ballots with the exception of one per county, or some of the other attempts at voter disenfranchisement occurring in Texas."
AskAnAmerican,"One of the challenges was thrown out, but [the federal one is being reviewed today](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/31/politics/texas-ballots-drive-thru-voting-hearing-monday/index.html)."
AskAnAmerican,"Right, but the polls are indicating that Biden has regained in that area, particularly in the rust belt.  We'll see if he's gained back enough to win those states."
AskAnAmerican,"As a moderator at /r/politics I won't watch TV or anything else beyond reddit just so I can contribute to keeping the order, and I'm going to go to bed at a normal hour and try not to pay attention to results until the morning.  The whole ""horse race"" coverage on TV is unnecessary and stressful."
AskAnAmerican,Now imagine being one of the 130k+ voters in Harris county that did that and have their votes being questioned because they voted in a tent rather than a physical building.
AskAnAmerican,"I think the possibility for violence has definitely increased, but I also don't think it will be widespread or have a major impact outside of a few days."
cordcutters,"I've been cutting back in some regards but most likely in January I'll eliminate more.  I do get the Hulu/Disney+ package, I use Prime Video occasionally because I have it for mailing stuff, and I have Netflix.

NoStupidQuestions,I block them at the firewall on my home network.  It's just a matter of finding the right domain names to block as far as my LG TV is concerned.
politics,"The other thing is that politicians need to stop referring to latinos as all being brown-skinned poor people who walked across the border illegally.  Latinos come in all skin tones, many are descended from people who were on the land that became part of the U.S. from the beginning and aren't immigrants, and many are economically successful.

One bonus point -- for at least Mexican immigrants, being Catholic in Mexico is nowhere near as extreme as Catholicism in the U.S. seems to be and evangelicals are way outside of the norm for them."
ireland,Cosmic glans
politics,"From the article:

> One slide reads, “The very first essential for success is a perpetually constant and regular employment of violence.” The quote originates from Mein Kampf. The same slide reportedly urges officers to become “ruthless killers” and cultivate “a mindset void of emotion.”

That's worse than I thought it would be before I clicked on it."
science,It would be interesting if there were a way to force people to provide answers on a test of  graduate level scientific knowledge to be added to a list with the ability to post here. So far I've seen a lot of complaints posted about the study but nothing factual against it. It's just comment after comment of appeal to probability fallacies works no competing studies or data.
science,"You looking at this incorrectly. As a citizen, what crimes are you more concerned with happening to you? Murder, rape, robbery, theft, etc. When it comes to administrative crimes like not paying taxes properly, not getting their cars inspected, movie piracy, etc. you likely won't focus on it as much. That's essentially the reason the study focused on violent crime. A person not getting proper paperwork to enter a country doesn't itself create victims in the same way a violent crime does."
VoteBlue,"This isn't a place to get too I'm the weeds of your argument that I mostly agree with but I have to disagree where you say there is no ""x"" sound in Spanish.

Just not that crap term ""latinx""."

CoronaVirusTX,They apparently have more cases than that.  I've heard that the administrators have discouraged people from reporting cases.
AskAnAmerican,"My employer used to have some Halloween related events and a few people would dress up, but each time evangelical Christians would complain and so the semi-official voluntary events were banned and most people stopped wearing costumes.  As morale is extremely low right now with COVID and how poorly the corporation has done with it, I doubt many would be in costume today."
movies,I have a dark sense of humor but unfortunately it's literally true. His funeral was Sunday and he was buried on Monday. I don't know for sure but I suspect it was a relative's visit that got my uncle and grandparents (and who knows who else) sick.
gaming,I take it you've never had a blowie while playing a video game?  The idea sounds better than the reality of it because you can't really concentrate on either one at the same time.  Frankly it sucks.
NoStupidQuestions,"The people posting and voting on content are biased.  Ideally people on reddit would vote based on the quality of the content as opposed to what they feel is more popular.  However, this rarely happens on any sort of website like reddit or any of the ones that came before it (I was active on Slashdot probably 20 years ago, for example, and it had the same problems.)"
NoStupidQuestions,"There are two things to factor in:

1. The subreddit as a structure.

2.  The userbase of the subreddit.

For the first, the structure of /r/politics is meant to be apolitical, in that the moderators aren't going to ban someone for having an unpopular opinion or remove content that doesn't have a certain political slant.  If you look at the subreddit rules, it is designed to be politically neutral.

For the second portion, while there's no solid statistical data to back this up, it seems to be a safe thing to say that the majority of people on reddit are varying degrees of left of center in terms of U.S. politics.  As a result of the neutrality of the subreddit itself, the userbase will determine the general experience there based on their activity.

Overall, compare the experience of someone in opposition to the majority in /r/politics versus a strictly partisan subreddit.  If you post something conservative in /r/politics that is in line with the rules, it will not be removed and you will not be banned.  It may be downvoted severely but the mods have no control over voting there.  On the other hand, if you post something contrary to the majority opinion on a specifically partisan subreddit, your content will likely be deleted and you risk being banned.  That's a pretty significant difference in my opinion.

tl;dr -- The subreddit is neutral but a lot of the users are left of center which gives the impression that the subreddit is liberal."
StrangerThings,Those remind me much more of a Nike collaboration with the Mexican soccer team.

politics,"I'm basically in the same position as you.  The main reason I didn't go with my backup plan is that the jobs in the U.S. in my line of work pay better, and my current position has good benefits, paid vacation time, etc. so I thought that as long as I'm employed I actually live a bit better than I would in Europe.  That being said, there is definitely some ""psychic toll"" or something that still wears me down with the B.S. -- not specifically from Trump, but from many of the people around me.  The casual racism, misogyny, religious idiocy, etc. seem to have increased fairly dramatically over the past few years and with COVID it seems like stupidity is out in full force.  I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I had already moved to a different country and found a lower paying job in a more stable society."

AskAnAmerican,"I think it would be fair to say that when people say ""end corporate personhood"" they're not saying to leave corporations out as some legal gray area.  It's more about restricting their purpose and abilities to help focus them on why they exist as a form of public organization as opposed to being able to participate in political influence or anything like that.  They should also probably be restricted to few lines of business, to avoid having huge corporations that have too much control and power."

I know it wouldn't be realistic but why can't we build a town somewhere for these people where they can all live semi-normal lives and have jobs and all that, but not living in a place where children are allowed?

NintendoSwitch,"At the end of the game, off camera, perhaps Cappy was thrown down on the moon.  Given the size of the moon, it took centuries for him to take control of it.  In that time, Mario, Peach, and all life on Earth changed.  There were great cataclysms and advanced society fell.  

Eventually a new world formed with no remembrance of the past with Mario, Peach, etc.  This less advanced society did eventually discover magic and the descendants of Peach still lived in a castle.  However, the Mushroom Kingdom and most of the forms of life that inhabited it were long gone.

During one of these great cataclysms Cappy had finally gained enough strength to fully possess the moon.  However, the cost to his sanity and even his appearance was too great -- having barely survived all these years, his visage was like that of death.  Cappy's face on the moon took the form of a grimacing skull, making his millennia of suffering apparent to the world below.  His desire to reunite with his beloved Tiara was all he could think of.  Cappy then decided to go to the last place she had been -- the Earth below.

Unknown to Cappy, Tiara was on Earth, but over time she was broken and reshaped.  Rather than being a royal crown, she had become transformed into a spiked, heart-shaped mask.  Her powers were warped as she was used to perform horrible magic for evil people.  At one point, she tried to possess an evil being but the end result was her being permanently forged with them inside the mask.


/s -- I definitely don't take this seriously.
As events transpired below, the Cappy-possessed moon descended toward Earth.  Both Cappy and Tiara wanted nothing more than to be together, but the evil Majora who possessed Tiara had other plans.  As a result, the events that transpired became known as The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask."
texas,"In voting terms that is definitely youth, as in ""young adults"".  You may not have known, but we don't really let eight year olds vote in America so what you're thinking of as ""youth"" likely doesn't apply to voting."
texas,"> The Democrats do not provide the change we seek, they are just the only alternative to fascism.

I'm going to offer a suggestion.  You and your friend group (and others) need to get more involved long before the general election.  You all need to get involved before the primaries.  Some of you should run for lower level offices and try to work your way up.  The only way to get what you want is to push for it consistently, and the only way I can see that happening is for you to become influential within the Democratic party.

This happened on the Republican side by the way.  Think of former Republican presidential candidates like Mitt Romney or the late John McCain.  These were mainstream Republicans, but after the Tea Party took over, ran Tea Party candidates, etc., the Romney and McCain faction of the Republicans became pariahs.  So much that the former mainstream are now running ""The Lincoln Project"" that make ads against Trump.  

Now I'm not saying that the Democrats need to become an extremist party like the Tea Party made out of the GOP, but that if you and your friends, their friends, etc. get involved you're going to be able to shape the Democratic party to be more responsive to your needs.  With the system we have, it's far easier to become influential within one of the two big parties than to form a third party and be successful."
texas,"During the primaries I suspected that is why there were way too many Democratic candidates.  They all thought, ""if I can get past the primary, I'm as guaranteed to become president as is possible."" so they ran even if they were a nobody or early in their career."
texas,"If Trump loses Texas in the popular vote, I seriously doubt that this would happen.  Republican politicians are too thin-skinned to stick out their necks for Trump like that.  The only situation I could see something like that being used would be in a swing state with a close race (or electoral fraud of some sort giving the impression of a close race) -- somewhere like Florida.  However, if Biden gets the popular vote in Texas, the actual swing states won't even be close and the GOP wouldn't dare try something like that.

That being said, I don't expect Trump to lose Texas although I think it's going to end up being much more competitive than before and I do believe that Texas will eventually become a Democratic state."
pics,"Every living person in that photo, regardless of race, gender, or religion, is a piece of trash.  The single unifying thing about all of them is that they're terrible people."
changemyview,"Let me go through a few:

> - Democrats are actively proposing racist policies that harm Asians in California. Biden's election can increase chances of these policies actually being implemented, not only in CA but in other areas as well.

I'm not aware of any racist policies or policies against Asians in particular.  If anything, the only thing I can think of are policies toward college admissions but I don't see Biden having any influence on that.  Even within California at the state government level, neither party is actively doing something to change those policies to make matters worse for Asians as far as I've seen.

> - Tax cuts, especially for those with small businesses

The Democrats have a proven track record with spurring innovation and investing in business.  Even something as superficial as the stock market does better when the Democrats are in charge.  Biden says that his plans will only raise taxes on those with income of $400k/year and above.  As a result, I don't think these will impact the vast majority of Asians or any other type of Americans.

> - The riots

Trump has only exacerbated racial strife in this country, and his support for right-wing terrorist groups is far worse than any looting that has occurred in some cities (which frankly already had problems.)  If anything, I would expect the left-wing protests and few riots that have occurred to reduce if Biden becomes president.  As to the far right, they're becoming emboldened by Trump and I'm not sure how they will go away or calm down in either case.

> - Biden's alleged affinity towards China and in general his lack of major achievements in the past 50 years

Alleged is a key word there, because I've seen no credible accusations against him with China.  He has said some kind things about the Chinese president on a personal level, but that's about it.  China is the second most powerful nation on Earth, so it does make sense to work with them.  All Trump has done is cede power to them internationally as they've been trying to replace our influence in Africa, Latin America, and former Soviet countries.

Separately, I'd say that the general ""lack of major achievements"" is still far superior than all the horrific things Trump has done.  Stability is better than fomenting civil war, painting us into a corner economically, and wreaking havoc on our rule of law.  Even more, he's responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths from COVID by taking virtually no action against it, and constantly lying about progress.  Do you remember early on after his denials the talk of how you could get tested at any shopping center parking lot, or all the lies about vaccines being available by now?  Why didn't we get a box of PPE like all the developed nations did?  Why can't we trust our leaders to tell us a consistent message?  Why did we never really have any sort of effective lockdowns or efforts to mitigate the virus?  If Biden is boring and predictable, he's going to do a far better job than Trump on COVID by simply working with the CDC, FEMA, etc. to do what was in the plan that they published during the Obama administration."
changemyview,"> Is there any other thing that can be considered racist other than hatred for other races or belief in superiority of their own race?

Firstly, the concept of race isn't even a real scientific thing so holding onto an affinity for a ""race"" is essentially racist itself.  Racism is about pre-judging people (aka prejudice) and not necessarily hatred.  Just to run through a few definitions (which I'm writing, not from a dictionary so they are open to debate) to demonstrate the various types of racism as I see it:

Race supremacist:  Believes only their race should exist and are superior to all other people.

Race nationalist:  Believes races should be kept separate and wants their current society to only contain people of their race.

Prejudiced racist:  Accepts living in a society with other races, but still does things to express that preference such as not wanting to live or work near people from other races.

Subconscious racist:  Doesn't actively try to work against people from other races, but does things such as feel nervous when a person from another race is around, would be disappointed but not say anything if their child dated someone from another race, etc.

Racism isn't a binary thing, it's a gradient, and there are general amounts of the quality of ""racism"" that exists in individuals.  I also left off another, more controversial type of racist that may fall under the CMV here, which is someone that tries to avoid actively being racist and doesn't even have bad feelings about people of other races, but doesn't challenge institutions or individuals that create racism.  I think this latter category is too broad to really be meaningful at this point, and the more ""pure"" forms of racism need to be the focus."
changemyview,I would argue that none of those points are actually valid though.
changemyview,"As a white guy that grew up in a fairly conservative circle, I can guarantee you that the person you responded to is onto something.  it is an *extremely* common view that racism requires active hatred against a minority group, and in some extreme cases, it requires there to be *irrational* hatred against a minority group (meaning that to them, it's not racist to dislike a group of people if you had a bad experience with a member of that group in the past.)

I know this stuff seems stupid, and it is very ignorant, but that's how a lot of white Americans think.  Anyone short of a KKK member or neo-nazi actively in favor of violence to kill members of a minority don't fall under the guise of racism to them.  Fortunately, this type of view is considered outdated among younger people even within rural white communities, but a lot of boomers and such still think that way."
changemyview,"Going back to what OP said in the beginning, the people being discussed refuse to acknowledge Trump's racism.  That is different than acknowledging it and having some counter-reason that Biden would be worse. (e.g. Trump may be racist, but Biden is a Lizard Person and will harvest all of our organs to make soup.)  Sorry for the silly example, but I'm not aware of any legitimate justification for Trump being better than Biden."
changemyview,"The problem is that your statement left off the action part, which is what would really determine if it's racist or not.  Let me show you what I mean:

> Muslims were responsible for the major terrorist attacks in Europe in the 2010s.

If the action part is something like:

>...so we should ban Islam in Europe and kick out all Muslims.

>...so we should fear and mistrust Muslims in our countries.

>...so Muslims are terrible people.

Those would make it bigoted.  If instead you stated something like:

>...so we should reach out to Muslim communities in an attempt to build bridges and reduce the polarization that results in extremism.

>...so we should work with moderate Muslims and provide support for them.

Those would not be problematic.  So when you say:

> Now, you can either say I'm racist, or the statement is racist, or that it's just a factual statement and therefore can't be by itself racist. But if you decide that your interpretation is the first one, then it doesn't mean it is.

In reality, there's almost always context.  So while your factual statement alone may not be problematic, there is always going to be some context whether previous statements by you or someone else in the conversation, or something else."

NetflixBestOf,"I don't know how old you are or what your life experiences are, but I think this show is really good for people who grew up watching horror and action movies in the 80's.  Go back and watch something like Gremlins, Terminator, Red Dawn, etc."
AskAnAmerican,I observed this in an older relative -- he and his wife would yell at each other and were often miserable.  She passed away from diabetes and he started having multiple girlfriends.  It's actually quite impressive to see people in their 80's and older being players.
AskAnAmerican,"> Why have rooms of the house you use only a couple times a year like a formal dining room or ""salon""? It's literally wasted space.

Two reasons:

1. It does serve a purpose sometimes, such as having a formal dining room with a big table that is used for big get togethers.  Sure it may not get daily use, but it's nice to be able to fit everyone at the table for Thanksgiving and not to have a ""kids' table"" that is a folding card table that they have to crowd around.

2. Depending on where you live, real estate may not be too expensive so having that extra room may not be a big deal in terms of expense, and you could use it for something else if you really want to."
transformers,I came here to say something similar.

Arcade1Up,"I'm going to go in a different direction.  What's the purpose of owning 9 Arcade1Up cabinets?  Either you get them because they just look awesome, or because you truly have a lot of people hanging out at your place that can rotate between the games like at a real arcade.

As cool as a bunch of arcade games are to look at, if it's just you or a small group of people you likely just need one or two cabinets with all the games you want loaded on them.  Why not use that extra room for other stuff?  For example, my game room has an air hockey table and a small putting green as well and I am strongly considering an Arcade1Up Pinball table.  I have nostalgia for the arcade experience and unfortunately even without COVID my town doesn't have a good arcade to go to.  However, even when I have a bunch of people over so few of my friends are into arcade games that it ends up being like 15 minutes at most and then everyone just wants to sit down and talk."
RedditForGrownups,"> Why quit a job that pays 3, 4, or even 5 times what you'd make in your ""happy job""?

Like everything, it's complicated.  A big part of it boils down to the question, ""What do you need that money for?""  If you're a single adult with no kids, spouse, mortgage, etc. and want to pick up and move to Hollywood to become an actor, that's fine.  Even if you're likely to fail, you can always get a higher paying job later on if you did it once before.  Where it becomes a problem is if you have huge responsibilities like children, then you have to take the most responsible form of employment even if it is something you don't fully like.  At the end of the day though, your job is a means to an end, and your passions are what add meaning to your life.  If you can combine them, great, if not then it's all about finding the right balance.

> My point of view is to grind while I can and do something fun in retirement.

That's a fair strategy, and not far from mine as well, but given the ages at which the men in my family have died I want to enjoy life now as well.  For example, although I don't even play in a casual band, I have the guitar rig that I really want.  It was expensive but worth it.  I also use my paid vacation time well -- in 2019 I went on trips to the Grand Canyon, Paris, and Philadelphia.  Once COVID is over I'll resume my travel.  I have a few other things on my ""bucket list"" that are expensive that I plan to do as well, such as drive a Ferrari and a Lamborghini.  These things are part of the tradeoff for me, even if it means I might have to work a few extra years to make up for the lack of savings in some areas.  

On the other hand, if I had a similar corporate job but my hypothetical employer didn't allow me to take time off for vacation, or made me work nights and weekends on a regular basis, would I be able to participate in my interests?  Then it would be worth it for me to find a lower paying job that would allow me to do these, even if to a lesser degree.  Could I still enjoy playing on a cheaper guitar?  Would I enjoy travel still, even if it were less frequent and in less expensive accommodations?  I think so.  As long as I'm above a certain threshold in my hierarchy of needs my wants should be in focus."
investing,"> I say that from an engineering perspective, not having looked at their balance sheet.

investing,"As a company, they have a very aggressive sales team and their strategy is to offer very good deals up front then once the initial term is over, raise prices dramatically once the client is stuck with them.  They also allow their customers to heavily modify the environment, which seems nice from a flexibility standpoint, but makes it pretty much impossible to migrate to any other platform due to the professional services expenses that accompany rebuilding all that custom code."
changemyview,"> ...we also would need to stop climate change, but I doubt anyone would be willing to give up their luxuries that destroy the climate.

Fixing climate change is not at the individual level.  It's 100% up to the government to do.  The largest contributors to pollution within the U.S. are large corporations -- their customers have very little influence or ability to stop using their products in a lot of situations.  Stuff like giant container ships, pollution from factory farms, etc. are the main problems and only the government is more powerful than the corporations that are creating this pollution.

> I can go to the gym but it is quite taxing and so I don't do it/don't do it that often.

What if we had a Scandinavian-style love for exercise ingrained into our culture from childhood?  Going to the gym or exercise in general would be a natural thing.  However, the biggest factor in our lack of health isn't exercise as much as our diets.  The government could sufficiently tax some of the most unhealthy foods and prohibit minors from buying them while subsidizing healthier foods and ensuring that they're available for people.  Even something as simple as making school lunches actually healthy (instead of counting ketchup as a vegetable) would go a long way."
changemyview,"Most of the problem with the U.S. system is dealing with insurance companies and billing.  When it comes to actual services rendered, medical professionals in the U.S. generally do a really great job."
changemyview,"> This is what happens when diversity creates conflict. When it happens slowly it is easier for new members to assimilate to a dominant culture and even for existing cultural members to modify to adapt to new cultural influences.

Let's focus on this bit and take your analogy further because there's a huge factor that I feel needs to be taken into consideration.  Assume for a moment that the people in your scenario are 100% white, attend the same church, work at the same factory, and have a similar income and education level.  They're the most homogenous people possible for this situation.

However, something new happens -- let's say a new technology comes out and a company that deals with it sets up shop in that town.  The younger people graduating high school go to college to get a job back at that company.  As a result of the college experience, they are more educated, more likely to travel, are less likely to be religious, and have a higher income than average.  For the sake of argument, let's assume that all of these young people have the same outcome and all of them move back to their small town.  

To make matters more starkly different, let's also assume that the new technology has rendered the purpose of the old factory obsolete, and as a result the older people in the town are all laid off and have a reduction in income, healthcare, etc.  Let's assume none of them will end up homeless since they all are around retirement age and saved sufficient money and have pensions and whatnot.

So my argument is this:  Generational differences alone are enough to destroy the homogeny you have argued for.  The younger people will have a completely different outlook on life than their parents, they have different values, experiences, and interests.  As a result, you will have conflict from within that community fairly similar to if outsiders move into that community.  To have less abstract terms consider the changes America has gone through for the past few generations.  The ""greatest generation"" went through the great depression and WWII, then their children grew up during a phase of some of the greatest prosperity in human existence (but also a lot of conflict and change, given Vietnam, the civil rights movement, etc.)  After that, Gen X, Millennials, etc. have had dramatically different experiences from each other as well.

So while your example might have worked in the past, where ideas and technology remain stagnant for generations, it doesn't really apply in modern society of perhaps the past 100 years or so.  That being said, despite all these changes, many societies in Europe are able to function at a higher level than what we see in the U.S.  Demographic shifts aside, both regions have had their share of immigration (and apart from the language barrier, most immigrants to the U.S. are similar culturally to Americans born in the U.S.)  So there must be something further that allows some European nations to do a better job with healthcare and some other concepts than the U.S. does."
changemyview,"Why can't the habits be fixed?  I seriously doubt there are that many Americans that enjoy being obese or gasping for air while walking up stairs.

RedditForGrownups,"Using the case of my relative, trying to reason with them gets you labeled a ""snowflake"" at best and they immediately discount anything you say.  Sadly, I'm not sure that most people are or ever were open minded to new information that may conflict with their preconceived views.  What's new as you pointed out is that we all belong to micro-bubbles that cater to us in very minute ways that makes too many people seem like outsiders.  I'm not sure how to fix this, but I'm tired of trying to reason with people who are unwilling to listen."
RedditForGrownups,"Ordinarily I'd agree, but this shit is serious.  My grandfather died of COVID last week because another relative ""politically disagreed with taking precautions"" against COVID.  He's also a huge Trump supporter and Qanon follower.  This person is my blood, but I won't mind never hearing from them or about them again.  I don't wish them harm, but I also don't see any value in having a relationship with them.

There are times to be tolerant of general disagreements in opinion and there are times to not tolerate ideas that literally put lives at risk.  Right now is the latter."
RedditForGrownups,"> If there is anyone I'm avoiding right now it's people in the medical field and ""first responders"".

There are a few things that might negate that though.  For example, not all people in the medical field will come into contact with potential COVID patients.  Another is that people who work in the medical field are more likely to get regularly tested than others.  I understand the idea of avoiding people in general unless you're 100% positive they are taking a lot of precautions but I wouldn't specifically single out medical professionals necessarily."

politics,"I work in the corporate world and it seems like diversity training actually does help some people.  Rather than thinking of racism/sexism in a binary manner between saint on one side and Nazi on the other, think of it as a gradient.  Some level of diversity training can help people that don't want to be racist/sexist avoid accidentally making mistakes that negatively impact others.  For example, if you are a manager and your team has an official company team lunch and you go to a place that sells barbecue but someone on your team is vegetarian, or you have a Jewish person on your team and the barbecue place only sells pork.  Perhaps you have a woman working for you and you ignore her ideas because the men on the team are more aggressive and loud (but not necessarily more often correct.)  Perhaps you have a person in a wheel chair but decide to give your whole team stand-up desks.

It's much more complicated than ""racism bad!"" stuff.  Some of it helps good people change their behaviors for the better.  Sometimes it helps people that don't want to be good to toe the corporate line better to avoid getting fired even if they are still racist.  Sometimes it just gives people another perspective to consider.

privacy,"> My question is, does QAnon encourage such behavior? Or are they just spreading a bunch of bullshit like the majority of the internet?

That's actually why I specifically compared them to ISIS in America.  Every time there's an ""ISIS terror attack"" in the U.S., it's not done as a part of some well organized group, it's almost more of a ""terror identity"" thing.  With Qanon it seems like they're not well organized and that the 4Chan posts are vague enough that there are already different sects of followers of that conspiracy theory, with various people who gain a following by interpreting the information drops.

As a result, some sects of Qanon followers are violent, like the Wolverine Watchmen, but others are just angry people sitting behind keyboards."
changemyview,"Your opinion is horrific and inhumane for several reasons.  I'll start at the beginning.

First, it violates basic human rights, specifically reproductive rights.  In fact, your proposal falls within [the U.N. definition of genocide](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf):

> Article II

>In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

>A. Killing members of the group;

>B. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

>C. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

>D. **Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;**

>E. **Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.**

So you are literally calling for genocide even if that's not your intent.  There's something about human reproduction that is sacred and should not be limited by anyone but the individuals who can consent either way.

Secondly, I think others have pointed out that there are less children adoptable than you would think.  As has been pointed out elsewhere, a large number, if not the majority, of children in foster care are there temporarily.  Add on top of that some special needs situations which people need to be prepared for, it simply isn't feasible for everyone to adopt.  I have a friend that was seeking to adopt a child (and already has two natural born children) and was going outside of the U.S. and still had to jump through a lot of hoops.  You're likely overestimating there to be too many children who are adoptable, and underestimating the bureaucracy and demand.

Finally, I'd like to propose an alternative.  Instead of punishing people for having children, we should do the following:

1. Reallocate more tax dollars to go toward programs that help orphaned and temporarily fostered children.  I could go into more detail in what I mean here, but I think that we already can do more to help those children without punishing parents and those that desire to be parents.

2. Provide free birth control as you stated, but not make it mandatory.  There are a lot of people who do not want to be parents and it would be a relief to them as well as society if it were easier for them to decide to not be parents.

3. Protect abortion rights and provide universal maternal healthcare.  This would also ensure that people who do not want to become parents will not bring children into the world, especially if they can get abortions as early as possible in the pregnancy to avoid the problems that a lot of pro-life people focus on.

I feel like these would make a bigger positive difference as opposed to implementing some sort of authoritarian genocidal policy.

Finally I want to address this:

> I would like more detailed retorts in the biological need to have a child of your own, I do not relate with this at all, and would like a better explanation on it

The fact that you don't relate to it is fine, but you have to respect that the majority of people do have the desire to reproduce.  Even among animals it's basically a required element of biological life.  As more intelligent beings we are fortunate enough to be able to choose, but that drive is still there for most people.  As a result, I'd suggest that you don't need to understand it any more than you would need to understand why people enjoy eating some type of food that repulses you.  You aren't the highest form of human thought or the standard by which all things are judged.  You're just another equal person like everyone else and as a result it's ok for everyone to have their unique views on this as long as they don't infringe on others."
privacy,"> Payment companies should not ban them unless they are proven to be terrorists

I take it you don't follow [the news](https://www.newsbreak.com/michigan/wolverine/news/2078765715908/who-are-the-wolverine-watchmen-members-involved-in-michigan-kidnapping-plot-support-qanon-deep-state-conspiracies)?  Qanon is less successful at harming innocents than ISIS in terms of being a terrorist group, but it's very similar.  It is a very loosely organized conspiracy theorist group whose members are becoming prone to violence."

atheism,"It's interesting that many Americans don't make the connection between Native Americans inside the U.S. border and other Native American groups that are from outside the U.S. (and some tribes live in both the U.S. and Mexico.)  Most of the Latin American people crossing the border have some amount of Native American ancestry, and I would say they are much more likely to be from an indigenous culture than Latin Americans who aren't refugees.  A lot of the people I've met who came here either as refugees or illegally had to learn to speak Spanish because their native tongue is an indigenous language."
atheism,How would one who is not associated with a religious group foster or adopt these kids?
movies,"Borat isn't making fun of people from Kazakhstan.  He's making fun of how ignorant Americans are to where they would believe an obviously ridiculous character like Borat to be authentic and put up with his shenanigans.  Even more, Borat uses his character to get the people he interacts with to admit really horrible beliefs that they have.  The central theme of the original Borat wasn't even necessarily, ""hey look at this crazy fake foreigner doing all these shenanigans!""  It was more, ""despite what Hollywood sells you, there's a lot of messed up stuff happening in the U.S. and a lot of bad people."""
movies,"The first movie was pretty good to watch at least once but keep in mind that the character Borat was also originally from a TV series that preceded the original film as well.  A lot of the skits are available on Youtube if you want to catch up.  The whole schtick being basically a combination of a Saturday Night Live type of character interacting with real world people basically lends itself to not needing continuity.  That being said, the first movie had a scene that had me laughing so hard I almost couldn't breathe, and I rarely laugh."
Coronavirus,"> We're just too sensitive to wear masks like that.

This is what I don't understand.  I grew up surrounded by tough people and I thought Americans were tough.  A lot of the stuff going on lately makes me question how we became people who would get so bent out of shape over masks.  I wear one every day I go to work and any time I go out shopping.  It's not a big deal.

Also as a test, I went out for a quick one mile bike ride in the afternoon under the Texas sun back in July just to see if I would have any problems and it had no real impact on my timing and I wasn't any more out of breath than I would have been doing the same ride without a mask.  I know the N-95s are a different story and perhaps some of the homemade masks are difficult to breathe through because of the materials, but the standard disposable one that is white on one side and blue on the other should not hinder breathing of anyone that is healthy enough to go out in public in pre-COVID circumstances as well."
Coronavirus,"I don't think you quite grasp what it means to be ""unaffected"" though.  Nobody is saying we're all becoming introverts permanently, but rather that some things will be permanently changed.

Just to give an example with my grandparents' generation who went through the Great Depression and World War II (as well as other social changes) it's pretty obvious that they were changed as a result of their experiences.  One thing both sets of grandparents did was to maintain something like a ""victory garden"" and would can vegetables, make jelly, etc.  Food shortages basically forced them to do that but it continued afterward.

For COVID, I expect more people will be more likely to wash their hands regularly than before.  It might become socially acceptable to wear masks in public if you're sick with a cold.  More office jobs may become remote work or flex work schedules permanently.  All the people who were able to stay home and had time on their hands who developed new artistic and musical skills may be able to enrich the world with what they've done.  At least those can be positive changes.

On the negative side, there are businesses that are gone forever.  Some experiences, like movies, concerts, etc. may be different going forward.  I do think there is going to be some sociological or psychological problem that will bite us.  For example I feel like people are less considerate of others now, and have less empathy than earlier this year.  People who lost their jobs and have no nest egg or government assistance to fall back on will have long-lasting impacts."
Coronavirus,"> There are plenty of people who just ignored this and pretended it wasn’t real that will come out of this psychologically fine assuming they or their loved ones don’t die.

Based on what I'm seeing in my family, the denial is very strong even when loved ones die.  Despite them dying specifically from COVID, it's their ""pre-existing conditions"" that are being talked about."
Coronavirus,"I would hope that fewer people have this response to masks.  We would have a huge benefit if we adopted the ""wear a mask while sick"" approach that some Asian countries have.  I would also like to see certain food-related jobs require masks permanently.  It would have a huge impact on influenza, colds, etc."
Coronavirus,"I have a concrete example for you:

My immediate family has been taking precautions while my extended family, who we haven't seen for a long time, have not.  One member of my family (who happens to be something of a COVID denialist) went to visit some elderly relatives even taking them out to restaurants and all over the place.  As a result, COVID spread and we have a few people recovering and a funeral scheduled for Sunday (that I won't be attending out of safety precaution.)

So while I have kept my family safe, there's nothing keeping my extended family and friends safe.  Am I pissed off that an extended person who is a denialist visited elderly family members and put them in jeopardy, resulting in deaths?  Of course, I can't just be like, ""oh, it was their choice"" when the impact is still felt."
