Last final of the last day of Senior year was his. He caught a student on his phone, jumped over 2 rows of seating (we were in an auditorium style lecture hall to be spaced out) & was fighting over the phone for a solid 20 seconds before getting it from the kid.

Turns out, there was a group in the class that had been taking pictures of the exam, sending it to someone else, & that person was sending back answers to all of them.

Don't know if he was able to nail the others in the group. But as I was wandering around our major's main building saying bye to people at the end of the day, he was in a back room absolutely sobbing a solid 2 hours later, so I'm assuming he was failed out with literally one test remaining in his degree."

Some advice I'd have for your sub specifically:

* Whenever someone in another sub comments posts a controversial, unpopular, or similar opinion, a response like ""Well that's an r/UnpopularFact if I've ever seen one"" would pull some traffic.
* This one may organically solve itself once election season is over, but I'd try to cut down on the political content. Right now, a solid third of the top posts on your sub's front page are political. Not only will that turn away people that disagree politically, even many people that agree with the views are pretty burnt out atm & I could easily see it turning them away as well. Maybe limit political posts to a certain time of the week, like many subs do for content that otherwise dominates."

HVAC,Sounds like I'll have to get my hands on a meter that can check for capacitance. Thanks for the help!
HVAC,"It's an Armana ASZ16. I'm still looking for official docs, but repair clinic says it takes 40/5 mfd."
HVAC,"I understand that. But shouldn't they hold voltage long enough to check them after the breaker is killed? We're talking about  less than 5 minutes from killed to unplugged & checked. Surely if they entirely discharged in that time, the general advice would be to just kill power & wait a few minutes, rather than manually discharging them.

From the video I linked, when he's testing discharging it with the meter, he's getting what I'd expect to see- A voltage that slowly drops as it loses its charge. However, mine starts at absolutely zero.

I appreciate you not being an ass like most people commenting. I'm well aware of the dangers & how electronics work. I work with 240V appliances every day, just not A/C units, & I design circuit boards as a hobby."
HVAC,"Unfortunately, my meter doesn't have the ability to measure capacitance.

I may be way off base here, but I assumed that checking to see if it had voltage stored would essentially be doing the same thing, but with less useful info if it did show a charge. If it had a charge, it wouldn't necessarily let me know that the capacitance was still at its full rating. But the fact it didn't hold a charge at all made me think that it was dead.

I based my assumption off [this video](https://youtu.be/H3eyBGy2x1I?t=54), which shows the guy testing if a voltmeter is good for discharging a capacitor. Spoiler, it would technically work, just very slowly."

But things are finally looking up!! The car just needed a new battery that would hold a charge (replaced for free under Costco's warranty). Plus, we found a house that next day that was actually 6k under our original budget that we LOVE!! It's well maintained, has everything we both wanted, & all sorts of cool things we didn't know we wanted (like a laundry chute in the master closet)!

It was listed while we were eating dinner- our agent got us the first showing at 8:40 that night & we told him to put an offer in within 2 minutes of arriving. Accepted the next morning before anyone else even looked at it. Got inspection this Friday & short of any major issues (10k+ repairs), we're fine dealing with just about anything for this house.

I guess it fills a niche for people actively using woodworking to make tons of projects to sell, but somehow don't have a workshop & storage of their own.

mancave,"Which desk? The one in the main room is just my drafting table, which I pretty much never sit down at to work there anyway.

The one in the side room was plenty of space to sit down at. I'll be removing the door so it doesn't feel as cramped, but even with the door in place, I can fit the desk & chair with plenty of room to sit. There's 21"" from front of desk to wall & my chair back is only about 14"" from my desk when I'm sitting there. My ""desk"" in there isn't actually a standard desk size, it was an oversized clothes display table from Sears I got when they shut down.

The size of the room is a bit misleading based on the model I posted, so spaces like that side room appear pretty small. Everything in there is relatively large. The rug under the couch is 10' wide & the aquarium is a little over 4', just to give a few references for the sizing of things."
mancave,"The house actually has 2 full bedroom suites. The two walled in areas on the left are a walk-in closet & a bathroom. Going to the trouble of removing those walls & the bathroom would be a lot of work for not much gain & would almost definitely reduce the value of the house by a decent bit.

The tank is what I'm most excited about! I've still got to build that canopy that will go on top of it to hold the lights, but I'm hoping to start that next week."
mancave,"I'll do my best to explain my madness, lol.

The walls are actually normal, full-height walls. I just have them cut away like this so I can rotate my view in SolidWorks & see things at different angles. If I had them at full-height in the assembly, I'd only be able to see everything in the top-down view, which wouldn't be super useful.

For the bar/couch/TV setup, I've triple-checked my distances & mounting height to make sure that won't be a problem. The bar height will be a standard 42"" floor to bar top. I used [this guide](https://www.dynamicmounting.com/high-mount-flat-screen/) for choosing the TV mounting height & it will be 46"" from floor to bottom of TV. 

So at a normal viewing angle, the bar won't block the TV, even if you're sitting on the very edge of the couch as close as possible. My toolbox at work is exactly 42"" high thankfully, so I got to test this out for myself, rather than just relying on the numbers. The bar doesn't block the TV until you're sitting 2"" off the floor. Even sitting entirely on the floor, it only covers the bottom inch or so. Sitting on the couch 16"" above the floor, there's plenty of wiggle room.

That is a fish tank between the two bar sections. The larger ""L"" bar is designed that way to block the air vent on the floor from directly blowing on the tank. If you looked behind the bar, you'd see the vent about 2"" away from the skinny ""L"" leg.

The smaller bar section to the left of the tank will be more of my aquarium tool storage & water container hide-away than a bar. Rather than shelves, it will just have one large cutout that will hide the top-off water container for my tank. I'll have a pump in the container plumbed to the sump underneath the tank that will just pour in a few cups of water at a time as it evaporates throughout the day.

The table in the main room is my drafting table I use for working on projects. I'm standing most of the time I'm using it, so I put it in that corner where there isn't quite enough room for a chair as well.

The table in that side closet will be my computer table. I'll be removing the door, so I don't overheat in there. I've considered swapping the tables & putting the drafting table sideways in the end of the closet. But I've still got multiple weeks to play with the concept before actually working on it! Assuming everything goes according to schedule, we'll be closing on this house end of July."

mancave,"SolidWorks. It's just a general 3D modeling program, not typically used as a furniture placing tool, lol.

I have a collection of roughly 2,000 pins or so that I've bought or traded for & have had around a dozen sets that I've had produced. I can confidently say these have roughly a 400% markup.

I also didn't build a base until roughly 30 hours of play-time. I never built the habitat builder, since it wasn't immediately clear what it did or why I needed it. I also didn't know you were supposed to scan fragments, just thought they were pieces of wreckage for appearances...

idodi,"One thing my team always did that you may want to consider- Rather than breaking up before the IC, break up in the room. What I mean by this... Take for example a building challenge with 7 kids total.

2 kids working on those requests as they come in. This is a good way to contribute for the team members who aren't super technically inclined.

2 kids taking those pieces & putting them together. Breaking the team up like this prevents the too many cooks in the kitchen scenario that often happens. 6 kids all trying to work on a tower usually ends up with a broken tower!

1 kid that takes the first bit of time carefully reading the challenge over again, looking for ""loopholes"" or places to maximize points. *(For example, the ""flower"" instant challenge. I don't remember the exact details, but it boiled down to a bunch of score items, one of which was points for every leaf your plant in the flowerpot had. Most people/teams would make a typical flower to hit as many categories as possible, but the ""ideal"" way to do the challenge was to quickly roll a simple vine & put as many leaves on as possible.)* That kid will be responsible for making sure they maximize their points & don't miss any ""gotchas""."

politics,"There is a *massive* difference between a million & a billion dollars. Approximately a billion dollars worth of difference.

Is Bernie wealthy compared to me? Absolutely. However, I'm not in my 70s after a multi-decade long successful career.

But comparing one of the richest humans on the planet to a guy worth roughly $2 million is a joke. Bloomberg could literally spend Bernie's net worth once an hour, every hour, for the next 3 years & still have billions of dollars left over.

""Rich"" is a relative term. In comparison to the Average American household, Bernie is 20 times as wealthy. Big difference for sure, but definitely still within a reasonable range if you're not in a communist country. However, Bloomberg is *620,000* times as wealthy.

mead,"I was suspicious of that as well, considering the price. So I contacted their ""Kirkland Signature Team"" to ask about their Southeast local honey & got the response to my list of questions about source, purity, & processing:

 "" The honey is polyfloral honey as it can be sourced from a variety of flowers. This honey is sourced from the southeastern states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Mississippi, and can come from any combination of these states at any given time. The only ingredient is honey as the honeybees have made it, and it is True Source Certified. The product is strained, which leaves pollen in the honey. It is heated to a temperature that is lower than 130 degrees, which is just warm enough to be able to bottle the honey, and is much lower than other processed honeys (this product is not considered processed). ""  

So long story short, it really does sound like this is legit. I know Costco's prices on multiple other things in bulk are crazy good, so this isn't out of the norm. With it being a polyfloral honey that will likely change throughout the season, I wouldn't necessarily rely on it to be consistent across brews. But for the price, it's pretty much impossible to beat."
mead,"Not sure about the Utah honey, but they sell a Southeast local honey here & it's \*definitely\* not clover. Very dark, strong taste. Surprisingly good. I'm not enough of a honey expert to say for sure what types of honey are in it, as it's surely a blend. But it's definitely a much more robust taste than clover."
mead,"I'll probably do slightly warm water in my fermentation vessel. I don't want to go too hot to risk airlock suck back. I have a drill attachment & an 18V drill, so I should be ok."

Tools,"Yep, yours was Dizzy Derby, I did that one too! Good times."
mead,"Ah, gotcha. That's pretty in line with the recipe I found too. As far as racking, I went ahead & got one of those drill agitator adaptors, so do you think I'd be fine not racking? I feel like warming the honey & hitting it with an 18V drill for a few minutes should mix it far better than racking would."
mead,"Oh wow, maybe I've misunderstood yeast ABV then. I was under the assumption that yeasts are rated for the alcohol percentage they can survive in. With D-47 being a 14%, I thought once the ABV hit 14%, they'd die off. Is that not the case?"
mead,"This is another suggestion I've seen as well, but without much information. If I'm looking at 19 lbs total, would only adding 3 lbs to start run the risk of fermenting to completion before I add more? Does that matter? How does this affect the timeline of the fermentation?

Edit: Found this online, posting for posterity & your opinion.

> A way to speed the process is to add the honey in smaller batches. For example, if your recipe calls for 20 lbs of honey in a five-gallon batch, start out with 10 lbs initially. Once the fermentation starts to slow down, rack the mead into another fermenter and add 5 more lbs of honey. Wait for the fermentation to slow, rack again, and add the last 5 lbs. If you take this approach, make sure to leave some room in the fermenter for the added volume of honey. Adding the honey a little at a time like this will keep from hitting the yeast with high-sugar conditions which aren't good for them. The yeast will repay you by doing their job more quickly, and you won't have to wait as long for a finished product.

The biggest thing I'm not sure about is the multiple racking steps. I don't see why that would be necessary. In fact, I feel like it would be harmful. If I'm planning on a certain amount of honey being eaten by my initial yeast, leaving yeast behind after each racking seems like it would result in a much sweeter mead than if I just added it in stages in the primary fermentation vessel."
mead,"Ah, I see where the confusion is for the ratio. I see what you mean as far as the 1.25 gallon batch, my fault for mixing terminology in the same post. My original question is for a 5 gallon batch, 20 pounds (1 2/3 gallons) of honey, leaving 3 1/3 gallons of water. So the ratio there is almost exactly 2:1. 

But that example I gave about the 4 lbs of honey, I had seen someone saying to add per 1 gallon of water, not 1 gallon of batch size, making it 3:1. So yes, my example was for a 1.25 gallon batch, but my post is asking about a 5 gallon total one."
mead,"When you say good nutrition, you're just referring to the addition of goferm at the start & fermaid-o staggered throughout the first few days, correct? Is there anything else I should be doing as far as nutrients go?

Initially adding in enough honey for the desired taste seems like a pretty straightforward process: x amount of yeast can consume y amount of honey, leaving z remaining honey to sweeten the mead. If anything, back sweetening sounds much more complex & troublesome."
mead,"From what I'm reading, back sweetening is not regarded as the correct way to go about getting a sweet mead. Plus, I don't want to deal with adding all the chemicals at the end, risk restarting fermentation, etc. I'd prefer to do this the right way & get exactly what I'm going after. I'm very much a beginner to brewing mead, so I don't know all the secrets to it. But I'm no stranger to similar industrial batch processes & am pretty confident in my abilities to not screw it up, as long as I have all the info up front.

&#x200B;

Exactly what sort of extra coddling does a high honey to water ratio require, compared to a typical batch?"
mead,">Yeah, because 1.035 may be cloying in a traditional.  
>  
>I have fruited meads that end up at 1.040+ but there is a lot more going on to prevent it from being cloying.

I'm planning on steeping Chrysanthemum buds in my water from the start, so it won't just be a straight cloying honey taste. Is 1.035 really that intense? The scale for sweet meads starts at 1.025 & goes up to 1.05, I thought I'd be pretty safe hanging around a little less than the midpoint.

&#x200B;

>Yeast choice matters as well, I ferment at 1 to 1 ratios with a high gravity champagne yeast hitting north of 20% and with very tart fruit to balance the final sugars.

I'm using Lavlin D-47, which should be around 14%. The calculator recommends all the way up to 22.4 lbs honey for an 18% yeast.

&#x200B;

>""drown the yest in sugar""...Complete bull with correct nutrition. If you don't follow SNA, rehydrating with goferm and all the rest higher osmotic pressure can result in sluggish ferments or stalls.

I'm planning on following the calculator's recommendations of a 4 part SNA & goferm/rehydration at the start.

&#x200B;

>Also, stop using ratios. Not only are you getting them wrong (4 lbs is 2 parts water to 1 part honey) it's a arbitrary and useless way to communicate. Gravity allows concise communication.

Could you explain this a bit more? Ratios are a perfectly reasonable way to communicate any sort of mixing such as brewing & not at all arbitrary. Correct me if I'm wrong, but honey is 12 lbs per gallon. Meaning 4 lbs of honey would be 1/3 gallon. So for every gallon of water, you're adding 1/3 gallon of honey...resulting in a 3:1 ratio."
mead,"I'm planning on using Lavlin D-47 as the yeast, which is where I got my 14% ABV from. 

&#x200B;

I arbitrarily set the sweetness at 1.035; I don't have any scale to compare it too, but I know I typically like much sweeter meads & wine than usual.

&#x200B;

My biggest concern is I keep seeing it tossed around in forums & on Reddit that anything higher than 4 lbs of honey per gallon of water (so 3:1) is way too high & will ""drown"" the yeast in sugar. Is there any truth to that?"
mead,"Just found this post, as I'm looking to do the same!

&#x200B;

* Our federal debt has risen by roughly [2 trillion dollars](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/07/trumps-numbers-july-2019-update/).
   * Whether or not you believe deficit spending is good for the economy, one of Trump's major campaign promises was to totally eliminate our country's debt.
* Trump cut the corporate tax rate from [35% to 21%](https://www.thebalance.com/trump-s-tax-plan-how-it-affects-you-4113968).
   * He cut yours & mine too. By a much lower percentage & temporarily. The corporate ones are permanent.

Overall, our economy is still doing ok, continuing on Obama's major success turning our country around after the 2008 recession caused by republicans deregulating the financial industry. Republicans have a bad habit of crashing the economy by artificially pumping up the numbers while in office. Trump is doing the exact same now: huge corporate tax cuts coupled with massive borrowing & deficit spending.

&#x200B;

All that being said, the biggest effects are not able to be captured in stats. We are no longer viewed as a reliable country on the world stage after backing out of nuclear & trade deals. Our election system is compromised & the Republican Senate is actively working against fixing it.

&#x200B;

All that being said, one of Trump's few saving graces is the fact he seems willing to stand up to China. Certainly not for humanitarian reasons, but economic ones. He's using the Hong Kong protests as a pawn in the trade deals. I could very easily see him turning a blind eye to a violent crackdown if they capitulate to his trade requests."

FixMyPrint,"I decreased flow down to 90%, temp to 195, & am now printing a 10mm cube with 100% infill. I have the fan maxed out, cooling issues are well known with this printer & I already have replacement fans coming to upgrade from a single, dinky fan, to 2 nice ones.

I'll let you know how this cube goes. If it still looks bad, I'll try just sticking a regular fan outside the printer pointed at the print for now to see if it is a cooling issue or not."
FixMyPrint,[Here are some shots of all the sides.](https://imgur.com/gallery/iX7adak) Thanks for the help!
FixMyPrint,"I'll try that out tomorrow, calling it a night for now. Thanks for all the help, I'll report back with results tomorrow!"
FixMyPrint,"I think it may have helped slightly, but hard to tell on a small scale."
FixMyPrint,"Still getting curl at 95% flow. [Stopped the print here.](https://imgur.com/gallery/iFsuPGW)

Which temps should I back off? Bed, extruder, or both?"
FixMyPrint,"I wasn't sure whether you meant the top of the cube, or the printer, [so here's a picture of both!](https://imgur.com/gallery/36ksN74)

Good notes about Benchy though, I'll keep that in mind going forward."
FixMyPrint,"I just backed it down to 95% for the next print. Should that be enough to see any results? If this doesn't fix it, what's the farthest I should reduce to?"
FixMyPrint,Cube is having the exact same problems on corners. [Cube in progress. 15 minutes until completion.](https://imgur.com/gallery/0NmzQPn)
FixMyPrint,"Huh, I was under the impression Benchy was the standard first print. Guess that shows how much I know!

I'm printing a cube now, will report back soon."
FixMyPrint,"I'm using Hatcbox PLA, tried printing at 200 & 195 so far with the same issue. Bed at 60C.

&#x200B;

Using Cura, .15mm layer height. Print speed 50 mm/s, infill 80 mm/s, outer wall 20 mm/s, inner wall 50 mm/s. Retraction 5 mm. Let me know if there's any other settings that could be needed, thanks! This is my first printer & test print, so I'm still trying to absorb a lot."

AmItheAsshole,"It's not a small request imo. Smoking inside vs smoking outside is a massive difference, especially in a legal state. Most people, given the option, would prefer to smoke outside to prevent their house from constantly smelling like it.

If it's really that big of a deal, the ""small request"" would be to bring the kid inside."
NoStupidQuestions,"Thanks for that write-up! Really informative & interesting to see that it wasn't as simple as ""lightning contrasted better""."
3Dprinting,"Definitely a stationary hobbyist printer. The enclosure would be nice, but I feel like it may just be better to build one for the mk3s."
3Dprinting,"It's just a personal one that would be in my home. We have a MakerBot Z18 & a Stratasys something or other at work. They're nice for the environment & use, but way overkill for me."
3Dprinting,"Hmmm, the no resume on power loss may be a deal breaker for me. That's a really nice feature to lose along with the bed. 

MMU isn't a major deal to me, but it does bring up the point about upgradability. I doubt the 3D40 will even remotely compare in that regard."
3Dprinting,"That seems to be the general consensus, thanks!"
fuckHOA,"I doubt this would be the case. Whether or not you see it that way, their ""service"" is improving the community/neighborhood. 

It's up to the board to determine the form that improvement takes. Good boards do things like community social programs, shared space maintenance, etc. Bad boards do things like fines for grass 1/2 cm too tall & towing cars because they were parked in a visitor spot 30 minutes too long."
politics,"We'll see how it stands once debates start up. Of course Sanders is at a higher name recognition, he was the only other Democrat with a shot last year. In what way can you paint that as a negative? 

The fact that the other candidates are gaining on him in name recognition is an obvious side effect of them running. Nothing to do with their chances of winning though."
politics,"I'm definitely leaning Bennie, but she's the only other candidate in the race I'd be happy to vote for.

I'm all in for Bernie-Campaigning, canvassing, phone banking, etc.

Warren, I'd definitely put some effort in, but maybe a couple of hours max, vs days/weeks.

Any other candidate, I'm staying home until election day. I'm voting D no matter what, but if they don't learn their lesson from Hillary & try shoving Biden down our throats, once Trump is out, I'm back to a solid independent."
nashville,"Do it, seriously. The best decision we ever made was skipping the ridiculous wedding & just have a small thing at the courthouse for family, then a great reception at a local bar/arcade a few weeks later for friends. Both together wound up costing less than $2k for absolutely everything. You'd be lucky to get a venue for that price, much less all the extra things like food & a photographer."

ReefTank,"How long have you had it & what do you feed it? I'd love to get one, but the info on them seems sparse."

idodi,Please report back after you go to let us all know how the changes compare! It will be extremely interesting to hear the opinion of someone who's been to both the new & old Globals.
idodi,"I'm afraid your story is going to be a pretty common one this year. I'm so sorry to hear that, especially the possible end of your team. I definitely don't blame you for the decision.

Overall, the communication for the massive changes has been...lacking at best. I'm doing my best to reserve judgement, as there may be way more behind the scenes that isn't being made public. But based on the info we have, it seems like there were some really questionable decisions made.

If it makes you feel any better, stories like yours are absolutely being passed up the chain."
interestingasfuck,"I've been doing a ton of research recently, looking into buying a printer. From everything I've read, the mk3 is significantly better, at $750. The Ender 3 is definitely the best bang for your buck, but you can't pretend that it beats the mk3 overall."
PLC,"Good to hear, thanks!"
FixMyPrint,"Printer was working fine yesterday. Today, this print was acting crazy-the extruder kept hitting the first couple of layers & as you see in the picture, the layers ended up separated about a full inch.

Using PLA, extruder is at 215 C, Chamber at 35C."
3Dprinting,"That'd do it, thanks!"
gaming,"But by all means, buy it if it ends up being good! They've definitely lost all the good will required to pre-order, but if they learned their lesson (big if), show them that we notice."

DaftPunk,"Lol, just because it looks professional, doesn't mean it's not OP's first. Definitely not the first project they've taken on, but very easily could be the first helmet.

&#x200B;

Looks awesome!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,"So.... we're just ignoring the fact there are multiple black country artists? Like it or not, Old Town Road isn't a country song. Same reason Wake Me Up by Avicii isn't country.

Both of those songs definitely have country elements, but are not country songs."
idodi,"This is the first time since 2005 I won't be attending Global Finals. I really hope I'm wrong, but it looks like things are being taken in the wrong direction.... 

I definitely share the worry that Globals has been pushed out of the realm of reality for any lower income area, which is unacceptable in my opinion.

Plus, I don't think the person/people that made this decision are aware just how much of the ""experience"" of Globals will be completely ripped away by taking it off a college campus."
arduino,[Ethernet Shield 2](https://www.mouser.com/m_new/arduino/arduino-a000024-ethernet-shield-2/)
arduino,"I'm honestly not sure. It would require 8 USB ports, which I assume I could shelve achieve with a USB hub. My biggest concern is the length. I may be going as far as 50 feet from the server computer. Would I run into issues trying to do that?"
arduino,"I could have them staggered if required. Each Arduino would be responsible for up to 10 motors each. If they needed to spin at the ""same time"" it would be fine to have milliseconds, or even seconds, in between.

It doesn't need to be high speed, the shortest time between spins will be 15 minutes."
arduino,"It would be fun if the networking aspect wasn't a pain in my ass right now, lol.

I'm working on automating a testing lab for research, they'll only be opening & closing valves at certain times. Nothing super fancy, but still complex to me :)"
arduino,"Is say my question is almost the opposite actually. I know most of the pins used are just pass-throughs & I can use them for something else.

But what I'm trying to determine is if I can utilize the pins *not* physically attached to the shield. The more I look into this, I think I'm realizing this question may not be totally clear. Is the shield simply allowing control of the Arduino over ethernet the same way the onboard USB normally does?"
pokemongo,"Seconded. EX raids were a big part of why I returned, the whole Mewtwo thing looked awesome. Definitely re-considering my decision to return after not being able to make a single EX raid. Most of us have work."
TheSilphRoad,Yet another one most people can't do. Awesome.
TheSilphRoad,Agreed. I returned about a month ago & the fact I'm not able to do one of the main things I returned for has massively turned me off to the game.
TheSilphRoad,"Yeah, the schedule has been ridiculous."
pokemongo,Depends if you have the candies & stardust to invest in leveling it up.
samsung,Already tried resetting messenger. Called support & the first thing the robo operator says is customers in this area are experiencing difficulties with text messages...

The split here in the comments is between the people that have been around long enough to remember that rule I guess."

TheSilphRoad,"Ahhhh, that explains a lot, lol. First time I've ever seen our entire Mall without a raid for hours."
Ingress,"I've contently got scanner communication errors, restarting & force closing won't fix it. Any word on a reliable fix?"
pokemongo,"Exactly, the comment you replied to is way off on that point. Most of PoGo’s original player base couldn't care less about the company running the game. It just didn't have content to retain a large player base at release."
politics,"All subs are echo chambers. However, since reality has a liberal bias, we tend to focus on real world events. They're reduced to creating outage over nothing."

college,What's the difference if they wake up early vs. staying up late? 
college,"Still though... You know ONE person who did that. How many dozens/hundreds of people do you know that didn't? There's absolutely no chance that this stat is real.

I know a handful of people who changed majors once, then hundreds who either stuck with it until the end, or dropped out. There's no way there's a group of people that are out there changing majors the hundreds of times necessary to make the average 4."
tntech,"Yep! We don't get notified unless someone files a report though. So, it just relies on one of us happening to see it, which Burnie did thankfully, lol."
buildapc,"Correct to both points.

I don't see any quick boot options in my BIOS, or the post setup button. I've been searching for a while now, but no luck."

AskReddit,"Just buy a portable amp. My M50x actually came with one as a special deal when I bought them. It's smaller than a pack of gum & can either fit in your pocket with your phone, or slip to your pocket/waistband."
VinylReleases,"It totally varies month to month, depending on what deals I find. There aren't any albums I ""must have"", or else I would have already bought them. I just buy albums I like when I find a good deal.

Some months I won't buy any, bought 3 of them 2 days ago because I found a great price."

VinylDeals,Get it if you're on the fence! This is the best sounding record in my collection & it's full of great songs.
politics,"How do you plan on expanding Knoxville's infrastructure to handle the growing population?

Cumberland Avenue's construction took years & didn't really make that big of a difference to congestion. There are multiple intersections that are virtually impossible to navigate during rush hour & it's only getting worse."
politics,"[Here is a detailed link,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jrose/2018/12/05/tax-brackets-and-rates-2019/), but here's a basic description with easy to follow numbers.

We'll use $1,000 , $10,000 , & $100,000 as example yearly incomes.

A kid working part time mowing lawns on weekends in the summer makes $1000 that year. He falls in the 0-$9700 bracket, so he pays 10% in taxes on all of his income.

A college student working a summer internship makes $10,000 that year. He pays 10% tax on $9700 of his income, but 12% on the remaining $300 past $9700. He doesn't pay 12% on his entire $10,000 just because he ""left"" the 0-$9700 bracket. He only pays the higher 12% on the money he makes above $9700.

Now we move on to the mid-40s engineer making $100,000. He pays 10% on his first $9700, 12% on his income ranging from $9701 to $39,475, 22% on the income ranging from $39,476 to $84,200, then 24% on the rest of his income past $84,200. 

For the engineer, Republicans are saying, ""Oh no, this guy is paying 24% in taxes, so he's losing $24,000 a year!! When in reality, he's paying $18,175 a year due to income being split into brackets, rather than being taxed at a flat rate."
politics,I am a whale.
vinyl,I'd say it's simply due to the fact there are far more rock albums posted & upvoted. 
vinyl,You won't be disappointed! I did a ton of research before getting mine & I'm confident in saying it's by far the best cartridge at that price point. I've loved mine!
ChemicalEngineering,"You must've just made the cut for functioning MBPs. All the 2011 models & some of the 2010s & 2012s had totally trash logic boards, to the point they had a massive repair program for them. I had it sent out to the warehouse at least 5 times. It was an absolute nightmare. Dealt with total laptop failure during my Jr. Year 2nd semester finals, as well as Sr. Year 1st semester finals, along with multiple failures throughout the year. I used to always recommend Apple products, but I've been an Android/Windows guy since that $2500 piece of junk."
ChemicalEngineering,"WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GET A MAC!!

I had a MacBook pro & it was a terrible experience. Excel for Mac does not have nearly the functionality & I was unable to use my laptop for multiple assignments. Many programs are only Windows compatible, requiring you to dual-boot. It's a huge headache & not remotely worth it. I also had tons of reliability issues with it, but that's a whole other topic."
movies,"I'm curious-did you watch it in theatres, or at home? I ask because the music is definitely meant for a massive sound system. I watched it once in a Regal & the 2nd time at home with my dad over Thanksgiving. Even his multi-thousand dollar Klipsch surround sound setup didn't do the movie remote justice."
movies,"That's reasonable. 5/10 is simply average. Not liking the story is a perfectly valid reason to rate it that low. But as you said, it was visually stunning, as well as multiple other positives. To rate it in the bottom 30% of movies is just....wrong. If you're basing ratings on story alone & you thought it was that bad, a 3 would be reasonable. But taken as a whole, I honestly don't see how a 3 is justified, even taking differences in opinion into account."
movies,"Yeah, I started from the bottom & worked my way up. Knew this list wasn't going to be great when I saw Annihilation at 3/10. I understand high-concept  Sci-fi movies aren't everyone's favorite, but a rating this low just showed a complete lack of judgement, making me question all the other ratings :/

Even if you didn't understand the concepts at all, it was an absolutely BEAUTIFUL movie from a visual perspective, had some of the most tense moments on screen this year, & contained arguably one of the top 3 music scores."
politics,"There's literally no chance he gets away clean if he's dirty. Laying low might work for someone in a low-profile position, but Pence is 100% on the investigation's radar by simple fact he's the Vice-President. 

I truly think the biggest bombshell of the final report is Pence going down. Trump is a no-brainer because of how blatant & loud he's been with everything, so he's the one the media has been covering. But since there hasn't been anything newsworthy about Pence, he gets no media coverage. But Mueller isn't following Fox & Friends or CNN for his investigation, he's following the evidence, which likely ties Pence up as well."

Your biggest gap I see right now is the lack of a tank killer, which is what my ID does. My witch handles swarms, air, & spawns skeletons to block infernos.

This deck does pretty well, I hover between 4800 & 5100 most of the time."

pihole,"I found that last night, but I didn't find anything that helped out unfortunately. Thank you though!"
pihole,"Resetting it worked, thanks!"
pihole,I'm going to try changing the port first since I was able to find a good guide for that. Any pointers where to learn about setting of the virtual host?

Android,"Exactly! I really don't understand the mindset of people that blow thousands of dollars they can't afford to lose on these games. I've played Clash Royale since it came out & haven't spent a cent. No, I'm never going to be competing at the top 5%, but I'm having fun & more importantly, don't have to spent thousands."
ChemicalEngineering,"In my mind, it mainly means:

Flexible or nontraditional schedules, like 4-10s. 

Real benefits like more than 2 weeks of vacation, or actually being compensated for overtime.

More relaxed atmospheres in general. None of this BS tie & slacks every day for a non-customer facing position.

I guess it boils down to the fact millennials are less willing to tolerate the aspects of work that are detrimental for little to no reason."

Knoxville,"Do I help pay your salary? If not, then I have no right to know what you're being paid. Like it or not, public schools are funded by tax dollars, meaning you & I are paying their salaries.

That's already 60% for just 3 things. Not to mention the price of furnishing the dozens of mansions, which depending on how fancy you got, could easily account for the other 40%. Put an original Picasso in 4 of them & you've already hit a billion before you even get to furniture."

It was so disappointing-Blue & Graduation were some of my all-time favorite songs. But he was an absolute trainwreck, couldn't mix at all.

GalaxyNote9,"I used [playerauctions.com](https://playerauctions.com) & it was super easy. Listed it for sale, price of $150 & got a buyer I trusted (multiple verified purchases on the site & didn't sound like a 10 year old) in about 3 days. They should set up 2-factor authentication on their account, then give you their login info (they could set up a temporary password if they really wanted). When you log in, they'll be required to verify it on their end, so there's no risk of you stealing the account afterward. Then you just play 3 games with their account on your phone & let them know when it's done.

I dealt with my 2011 pro during college & it completely died multiple times, two of the times being two weeks before my senior year first semester finals & my junior year week before finals. Trips out of town to get it working & that time without a laptop absolutely impacted my grades.

They had it out for repairs numerous times & kept sending back the same piece of shit logic board that would die again in 2-5 months. They had plenty of opportunities to make it right. I was dealing with this all the way until they ended the repair program & to this day, haven't bought a single new Apple product, when I used to buy the new phone/iPpod/whatever every couple of years."
Tennessee,"The story I linked is in response to your Kavanaugh comments. Bredesen did in fact, immediately come out in support of Kavanaugh. 

""While the subsequent events make it a much closer call, and I am missing key pieces of information that a sitting Senator has, I’m still a ‘yes'.""

That's as middle of the road as you can get. He was a strong yes before the accusation & was still a yes afterward, due to it not being proven. He was one of only 2 high profile Democrats to hold that view, along with Manchin.

The accusation of trolling came from the fact you're blatantly ignoring the fact it's Republicans who are the ones attempting to ""ruin a man's reputation based on lies"", by trying to find a woman to pay to lie about being assaulted by Mueller. 

Look, I know a large part of your Reddit interaction is from the Donald subreddit, so you are very selectively fed news. But you're not in your bubble here, so facts don't get deleted."
Tennessee,"Obvious troll, but here's what's actually going on for anyone reading this.

https://www.gq.com/story/the-lasts-tweets-of-jacob-wohl

Republicans are currently trying to pay random women to file false sexual assault charges against Robert Mueller, but got caught when one of the women went to the media about the offer. Early signs point to Jacob Would as being one of the involved individuals, as the number for the group ""Shurefire Intelligence"" offering her money is publicly listed as Wohl's mother's."

These laws are to prevent criminally insane or temporarily ""snapped"" people from killing themselves/others on a moments notice.

blackmagicfuckery,They sink. Here's a video of a larger scale version in a hot tub. https://youtu.be/My4RA5I0FKs
blackmagicfuckery,"I think a big problem with that would be the size of the particles. I don't know why cat litter is the size it is, but the grain is muuuch larger. That would definitely impact the fluidization, as air would simply flow around the large particles, rather than push them upwards.

Plus, even if you used the correct size sand, you'd still have waste all in the bottom. All it would do is make the solids sink & gather on the screen above the air void. I guess you could design something that ""sliced"" the bottom few inches out of the litter every few weeks... But at that point, it would be much easier to just get an automatic scoop, like a poop Roomba or something, rather than going to the trouble of fluidizing your cat's litter box."
blackmagicfuckery,"It's been a few years, so I can't really go into the fluids equations behind it. But essentially, we took a 5 micron screen & used it as the bottom of a container we filled with... 7 or 9 micron, maybe sand. May be confusing some numbers with our Zinc Sulfide reactor.

Anyways, we hooked an electric air compressor to the bottom of the container that had a small void under the screen. When we turned the air on, it blew air through the screen & fluidized the sand. 

It was really neat to play with. We had different things like ping pong balls & golf balls to demonstrate stuff would float or sink just like it would in water.

Edit: On the bloop, depends on how dense it was. Most likely would sink to the bottom immediately."
blackmagicfuckery,"I built one of these in my process design class Junior year, they're even more fun to play with than they look. 

The most difficult thing was dialing in the air. Had to strike a balance between enough air to fluidize the sand, but not enough to blow it out of the container."
blackmagicfuckery,"You can do it with any sand, but it's best to do it with sand that has particles that are the same size. Underneath the sand, you have a fine filter that allows the air through, but not sand. You want those holes in the filter as big as possible, to allow more air through, so you try to match it to a uniform sand."
blackmagicfuckery,Fluidized bed reactors use the same thing you see in the video on a much larger scale. It keeps temperatures uniform & makes transporting solids between reactors very easy.

If you haven't, you should listen to Deconstructed-its a podcast that breaks down major hip hop albums song by song, going over influences, references, meaning, etc. I never even liked TPAB before listening to the series on it & I seriously appreciate it now."
Libertarian,"Maybe expansions & abuses of executive power for one. People here were basically running around with their heads on fire about Obama, but are totally fine with Trump doing significantly more.

He's literally just claimed he's above the law & can cancel or begin any investigation he wants. One of the principles true libertarians hold above all else is small government. Consolidation of those powers into one person isn't what ""small government"" means."
GalaxyS8,I'm totally happy with my S8+. Won't be getting a new one until this one dies or becomes functionally obsolete.
idodi,"Ahhhh, I love this idea!  Will 100&#37; be looking into implementing this in our affiliate. I want to try to update how our alumni are ""logged"" & an option to put themselves into these categories would be excellent."
idodi,"I'd definitely like to start doing alumni pins. I know multiple affiliates do that & it's a cool, small gesture that most of the alumni I know really appreciate."
idodi,"I totally understand the shift from high school to college takes a bigger time commitment. I have no idea how University teams find the time!

Personally, I stopped competing after graduating high school, but came back as an appraiser & CM each year. Once I graduated college, I got in touch with the RD here & they welcomed me with open arms :\)"
idodi,"I love the suggestions! As soon as I get the time, they'll all be going in the wiki, thanks!"
idodi,"Also, the comment about the hyped up twin DJs made me chuckle. They were so terrible :/ Air horns & random samples thrown all over the music with no regard to how it sounds, whether it actually fits, or even beat matched. The transitions were worse than Spotify just fading out the last few seconds & fading in the next song. I really wish they'd just thrown a music playlist together & put it on shuffle. Would have been much better. "
idodi,"That was a great read!!

I really wish they would totally revamp the international block party. There are a lot of issues with it in its current state.

It's ridiculous it's the same time as the costume ball. The food this year was an absolute joke, would have been much better to just not have food at all in my opinion. The emphasis should actually be on meeting everyone from other cultures. Make it after dinner Thursday night.

I'd say the only thing I'd really keep is the cool cultural experiences like the calligraphy, steel drums, etc."
idodi,"No matter how hard you try to explain it, there's no way to convey just how big pin trading at Globals is until someone experiences it."
idodi,Nice!!!!! You can always say you were literally the best in the world at something!
idodi,That's the worst!! Have you checked with lost & found?
idodi,"Tonight at 7:00 is the international party. There's tons of good food from agreeing the globe.

Also, at 7:30 is the costume ball. Most people make costumes from duct tape & it's cool to see what everyone comes up with!"
idodi,"I finished it up around 2:00 this morning. It had a bit of trouble standing after traveling in the car, but someone actually came by & fixed it!"
idodi,"Just got out of our officials meeting, super excited to get things started tomorrow!!

All I'm worried about at this point is rain. Sounds like we're going to have some thunderstorms this week."
BlackPeopleTwitter,"Honestly, even engineering isn't nearly as school dependent as something like Law or Medicine. It plays a factor for sure, but a degree from Harvard Law means significantly more for your career than a degree from Stanford Engineering. Both are highly respected, but the name recognition alone doesn't get you nearly as far in engineering."
Frat,"We had 95% of our events off campus in brothers' houses. The chapter house was just used for meetings & living.

Doing it this way is MUCH less safe, but makes the administration look good. Our parties were unregistered, unmonitored, & frankly, unsafe for the most part. I literally have pictures from one event where we had well over 200 people in an off campus house, packed wall to wall.

This is just the school trying to shift the blame. They know it will lead to more deaths & other negative consequences without a doubt. But at least they can say they ""did something about it""."
politics,"If Democrats get the majority & do nothing, I could see them never holding majority again. That would totally kill any enthusiasm for their party from a lot of people, myself included."
electronicmusic,Gemini is pretty awful live. Haven't seen many I was disappointed by.
Frat,"I know our system literally would not let you sign up for rush if you didn't meet grades. It's not a brother at the door checking your report card, it's all done through the school's system. So no, there won't be an exception.

I agree with the other commenters, even if you got up to 2.5, still highly unlikely we'd give you a bid. If you can't get your shit together with few distractions, you won't survive taking classes & pledging at the same time, full stop."
idodi,"In that case, it honestly sounds like the best course of action would be to take your program out of the school's hands. It sounds like the parents are only pushing back because of how hard the administration has made fundraising, though I could be wrong. Next year, just don't register through the school & meet at someone's house, local church, club, library, etc. 

What sort of reasoning did the administration give for saying no to the fundraising?"
idodi,"In my opinion, no, it wouldn't be reasonable at all. Putting myself back in the mindset of a kid participating, I wouldn't waste my time if I was told that from the start.

Yes, Globals is very expensive. But there are plenty of ways to pay for it that aren't out of pocket. If the kids are determined to go, it's up to them to raise the money if the parents can't pay for it. I came from a fairly small country town, less than 8,000 total population. Yet every year, we'd send anywhere from 3 to 11 teams to Globals. We'd have all sorts of fundraisers going on. It was exhausting, but we never once told a team they couldn't go because of money. Where are you getting the money to send your teams & who are you getting pushback from?"
politics,"Just for future reference, that's not how percentages work, lol. Let's put what you said to a money analogy: if you take 25 cents from one dollar & 25 cents from a another dollar, you don't suddenly have 50&#37; of the entire 2 dollars. You still only have 25&#37;."
idodi,"u/scytherswings, this looks awesome! I wasn't able to figure out how to actually get started with it though. Has it not been brought online yet?

Edit: Just saw the note about it still being worked on. If there's anything I can do, let me know! I didn't major in CS, but I know way around a few languages. I'd be way more knowledgeable about the pin side though, haha."
idodi,"Really interesting insight, thanks! I can definitely see that being an issue. 

I wonder if having on-site sign ups would make it any easier. Wouldn't have to be as formal of a thing as previously. Just have an area near TRECS to go if you're interested in a buddy team. Kids meet, exchange numbers, then pair up for the rest of the week."
BlueMidterm2018,"That's probably a more accurate way of putting it. Most people here don't care what other people do on their own time (weed, gay marriage, etc.) don't want to government ""taking their guns away"", etc.

AskReddit,"I honestly don't know exactly what mechanism causes it. The control room is one of the few places in the area that is actually air conditioned,Zaxby's so it's much cooler.

My guess would be the air inside the control room is at a lower pressure due to the lower temperature. So when you try to open it, the negative pressure sucks the door back in until the air near the door reaches a similar temperature to the air outside of it."
AskReddit,"Those control room doors are no joke. Along with the weight, you've usually got a massive temperature differential inside the room vs outside, so they're crazy hard to open sometimes."
