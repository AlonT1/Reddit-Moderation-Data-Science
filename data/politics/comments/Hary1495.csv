nextfuckinglevel,"Happy to be of help! To get more details out of cloth surfaces like wrinkles and such, its better you use a normal map or a bump one with the wrinkles and not model or use the blade tool to draw those lines. 
If you need any more help, feel free to hit me up!

And here's the wireframe if you're interested! https://i.imgur.com/Sqhb6V1.jpg"

nextfuckinglevel,"Some textures I take the shots myself of like random cloths, floor, wood etc. It's not that hard to do and just put it into photoshop, make it a continuous texture and extract the normal and bump maps and draw a roughness map with the brushes which gives the minor reflection and wear. 
Then UWV map it for the models."
nextfuckinglevel,Totally worth it

witcher,Your post has been removed as it can be considered an unmarked spoiler. Spoilers can potentially ruin peoples experience of The Witcher.
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks!!!
nextfuckinglevel,That sure sounds like good times!!
nextfuckinglevel,Unfortunately it is 😂
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! I used Cinema 4d and octane for the rendering. Blender is really great as well! I've seen some pretty Stellar renders with it as well!
Cinema4D,"It's cloth simulation and collision physics like dropping it as irl. And the other minor folds are ""normal maps"" textures."
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks man!!! My PC crashed multiple times during this 😂
nextfuckinglevel,Next time for sure 😎
nextfuckinglevel,You know i thought about placing a gun underneath the bed lmao

nextfuckinglevel,100hrs of modelling and 3-4hrs of render time
nextfuckinglevel,I taught myself from youtube videos since 2017 as I love games a lot and inspired by the cgi trailer and the graphics in the modern games :D So wanted to try it out myself! It's been almost 3 years since ive started teaching this myself!
Cinema4D,Thank you!
nextfuckinglevel,Used Cinema 4d+ Octane render engine. Both goes really well!
nextfuckinglevel,I could send you the wireframe of the project which is considered as proof in the CG terms 😁
nextfuckinglevel,Render time is around 3hrs at 5000 samples(noise clearance) and constructing the scene took about 100hrs
nextfuckinglevel,One day in the future for sure lmao
nextfuckinglevel,The bed side tables and the table lamp is a symmetry! rest of it is hand placed.
nextfuckinglevel,I could send the wireframe of the project which is the un-rendered version with just the models :)
nextfuckinglevel,Ahh that's awesome!! And thank you for the compliment!!
nextfuckinglevel,"
Ahhh damn i gotchu! Yeah considering the customer's request and stuff like that, it does get kinda hectic i believe! Same with game designs i guess. Pardon me if I'm wrong anywhere as I've got no experience in the professional field but working towards it!

And will hit you up if i have anything to ask! Thanks!"
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! I really don't think I can advice anyone with that much years of experience though! I must ask you for the advice instead :D Would love to hear one!
nextfuckinglevel,Yeah its way more intense than ray tracing and heavy as well! Most of the fuzzyness is cuz of the render noise which can be cleared by longer render times and samples!
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! It's not my main profession yet but I'm working towards it!
nextfuckinglevel,Damn im jelly of that
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks for taking your time looking at it!!
nextfuckinglevel,Appreciate the detailed thoughts! Will have those into consideration for sure! Always glad to hear some critiques!
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks for that!! <3
nextfuckinglevel,I've used blender at times and still do but mainly focused on C4D for large scale projects haha. IDK why but just got used to it lmao
nextfuckinglevel,Consider it done
nextfuckinglevel,I wish i was a magic man. First thing id do is fast forward 2020
nextfuckinglevel,I was too late in starting an insta cuz i mostly posted on reddit but maybe ill have to make one!
nextfuckinglevel,Depends on what GPU you got
nextfuckinglevel,"Haha you should get back into art! 
Thanks a ton!"
nextfuckinglevel,tell me about it xD never know whats real and what isnt
nextfuckinglevel,I used Cinema 4D and octane render engine! Modelling around a 100hrs and the render time about 3-4hrs
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks man <3
Cinema4D,I'm glad you found it immersive!!
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! Total project took around 100hrs and rendering the frame is at 3hrs
nextfuckinglevel,I wish i could jump into what ever i make
nextfuckinglevel,"A render time of 3hrs in octane.
Modelling part nearly 100hrs"
nextfuckinglevel,100hrs for the modelling part with texturing and 3hrs for the render time!
nextfuckinglevel,haha thanks for that! I'm a normie hobbyist who loves experimenting CG stuffs.
nextfuckinglevel,Hidden under the blankets
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you kindly!
nextfuckinglevel,Can we even believe anything now. And its 2020 😂
nextfuckinglevel,Haha! Would love to see his work though!
nextfuckinglevel,Render time is around 3-4hrs and making the scene and setting things up around 100hrs.
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks man!! Appreciate your support always <3
nextfuckinglevel,"Since you have a cat, I'll lower the rent to 300/month"
nextfuckinglevel,I will keep on working until its 100% real. Gotta make people doubt themselves 😎
nextfuckinglevel,It's path tracing which is used in CGI films. Octane path tracing to be exact!
nextfuckinglevel,I can relate to that 🤣
nextfuckinglevel,You're breathtaking
nextfuckinglevel,Nope neither can I sadly
nextfuckinglevel,Ill make sure to send it your way soon :D <3
nextfuckinglevel,Hmm how about a a copy of cyberpunk 2077 🤣
nextfuckinglevel,around a 100hrs of modelling and texturing and 3hrs of render time at that resolution!
nextfuckinglevel,"No photogrammetry at all! Everything is modelled by hand :D
I only tend to go for nature photogrammetry cuz that's the part where it never looks realistic when its manually modelled."
nextfuckinglevel,Appreciate that man! Thanks a lot!
nextfuckinglevel,Need those IMAX ones xD
nextfuckinglevel,3-4hrs
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you!! I think its possible in blender as well! I've seen a lot of amazing work done in blender. Even older ones from 2011 which is still mindblowing.
nextfuckinglevel,Gladly :D Thanks for the support!
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you!
nextfuckinglevel,I wish i had a bedroom such as this though xD
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! Most of it is just the tricks with the normal and bump maps :D
nextfuckinglevel,I sure do hope so!
3Dmodeling,Thank you kindly!
nextfuckinglevel,"Ah, glad to hear it! :D Thanks!"
nextfuckinglevel,"Thanks! Modelling the scene and texturing took about 100hrs and the render time of the image, 3hrs to clear the grainy look."
nextfuckinglevel,Modelling and texturing took around a 100hrs and the render time about 3hrs
nextfuckinglevel,Illusion level 100
nextfuckinglevel,Awesome! Will give it a look
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks man! Keep working on blender though! Would love to check out your work as well!
nextfuckinglevel,With sli it's better to render faster but vram won't be shared would remain the same as in a single gpu. As for render farms it's multiple systems working at once so mostly for movies like Transformers cgi or alita battle angels sort of thing. Has a high cost with it so not for single user lmao.
nextfuckinglevel,Ahhh damn probably something to do with the specular material or the render settings. You could get back into it and fix the mistakes :D or start a new project haha
nextfuckinglevel,That's for sure possible! Along with the help of sli. But for now the easiest way to render fast is the use of render farms as in movie productions.
nextfuckinglevel,"Well for eg if you had a single 3080, probably around 1 frame per half an hour or 15 minutes at 1080p lol."
nextfuckinglevel,"Thanks!
For one frame at 1080p it takes around 3hrs on my setup. It crashes when the render crosses vram limits with the number of polygons. This has around 16m polygons. 
Yeah I can move the camera and get a grainy preview in the live viewer but to make an animation I'd need a better gpu in SLI maybe 3-4 of em lmao. That'd be perfect for a 30frames CGI animation."
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you :)
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks for your thoughts! Will take that into consideration for sure!!
nextfuckinglevel,Yes it is! Cinema 4d is easier to get used to and has a better UI. I do suggest you also have octane as the render engine as the default ones aren't that powerful enough to push the limits.
3Dmodeling,Haha thanks!! Yeah the grain is from the render time. Just needs a few more hours to clear that but I already pushed my pc to its knees 😂
nextfuckinglevel,"It's simulated by the use of physics and collision :) Much easier and accurate that way than sculpting it! 
And thank you!"
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks!! Used Cinema 4D for modelling and Octane for rendering and texturing. With the path tracing engine.
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! It's done in a program called cinema 4d and octane where everything is modelled and textured. Basically like a game but with more details to objects.
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you!!
nextfuckinglevel,Appreciate your support!
nextfuckinglevel,I do have the wireframe or the view of the project without rendering along with the polygon count! Will send it to ya once I get back on PC :) I used cinema 4D for the modelling part and octane engine for the rendering and texturing.
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks!!!
Cinema4D,Thanks a ton! :D
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you!! :) It did take multiple tries and messing around with physics to get it right. And a few crashes in process 😂
Cinema4D,"Thank you! This scene is a part of a bigge project which I did long back. Now I just reworked it and changed a few things including some additional designs. On the whole for the project, it took around a 100hrs for the modelling and texturing part and 3hrs for the render at 7000 samples in octane.

I started to learn through YouTube tutorials back in 2017 and since then kept practicing with various scenes. Once you leanr the basis tools of modelling it gets easier even for intricate projects!"
nextfuckinglevel,Thanks man!
nextfuckinglevel,It indeed is! Well spotted haha
nextfuckinglevel,Good point :D And thank you!!
nextfuckinglevel,Thank you! Used Cinema 4D for the modelling and Octane for texturing and rendering with path tracing engine.
blender,I love renders like these when people do what they're feeling or going through. Nice work indeed! And take care man! Keep it going and dont give up!
3Dmodeling,Thank you! Created in cinema 4d using octane render engine with path tracing :)

3Dmodeling,I'm thrilled to hear it! Thanks! :D
witcher,Your post has been removed. Uninspired non-artistic memes and such are only allowed to be posted on Mondays.
3Dmodeling,haha good to know! thank you!
3Dmodeling,Thanks!! Used Cinema 4D and octane render engine :)
3Dmodeling,Thanks man! Appreciate that!
3Dmodeling,"I use c4d for modelling along with a few extra plugins that makes modelling a bit easier and faster to access. As for texturing, its done using octane materials the same for rendering as well."
3Dmodeling,"That's just a manual render projection where it renders only the scene in that region like assigned. for eg if the table lamp has too much noise, you mark it out and the engine renders only the scene inside that box and clears out the noise."
3Dmodeling,Thank you! I did check on a lot of reference rooms and lightings for different luxury rooms before making it final. Even for the textures as well. Gave an idea how close it should be to being real. And also some casual shots of people's rooms to get an idea of making the shot look real and not too professional.
3Dmodeling,Used Cinema 4D+ Octane for the render engine in path tracing.
3Dmodeling,Haha that's awesome! Thanks!
3Dmodeling,Appreciate your thoughts!
3Dmodeling,That's a good spot! Will fix that one for sure!
3Dmodeling,Thank you very much!!
3Dmodeling,Thank you!!
3Dmodeling,Thanks a lot for those words! Really appreciate it! I still would keep improving on any small mistakes and there's more room for progression still!
3Dmodeling,Thank you!
3Dmodeling,"This scene is a part of my older project which took around 100hrs. And i wanted a closer scene as last one was pretty much an entire room. And remade a few things in this and added a few extra details to make it more ""living"". Id say ont eh whole its around 100-120hrs considering the time from when i started the first one."
3Dmodeling,Used Cinema 4D+ Octane render engine with a sample of 5000 and some manual render regions. Took around 3hrs for the final render at that resolution.
3Dmodeling,"Damn, I'm glad to hear it! Thanks for your words!!"
3Dmodeling,Thank you very much!! Loved the time in making it close to reality as possible. Will keep improving for sure! And thanks for the support!
3Dmodeling,Thanks for your thoughts!! Really appreciate it!
3Dmodeling,Thanks!! Haha i would really love to have a bedroom like this 😂
3Dmodeling,"Thank you! Yeah this was a part of an older project which was an entire room which took around 100hrs and for this angle, changed and improved a few things and made a few more objects for details along with it. Was definitely worth it!"

If y'all pissed, report this comment as much as you need. 

And good job on this one! Love it @  [u/sparrowhawkcosplay](https://www.reddit.com/user/sparrowhawkcosplay/)"
reddeadredemption,"Yep, go for it! Big difference with one level up on upscale."
reddeadredemption,The upscale definitely makes a huge difference. And if you wanna invest in visuals I'd say go for it cuz this game is totally worth the performance hit imo 😂
reddeadredemption,"Yeah I'm aware of the TAA sharpened issue that's why I don't max it out. You can probably have the bar around the middle of it and use taa medium along with an upscale of 1.25
Here's an example of grass and a few distant trees https://i.imgur.com/HcXqrpY.jpg"
reddeadredemption,Both are off.
reddeadredemption,"For AA i have TAA on med and the TAA sharpness a few notches below the highest it depends on the preference there but don't max it out as it gives artifacts. I'm probably around 4-5 bars below the highest sharpness. One extra method I use to get sharpness and better AA is use the res scale one notch above the original res which would be 1.25. Has a performance hit but it's worth for that clarity and hence I reduced the shadows a notch. 

As for volumetric, got near and far volumetric on ultra and same for the volumetric lighting."
reddeadredemption,Thanks!! I'm Playing on the pc with most of it on ultra except for shadows on high. Resolution is 1080p with a resolution scale of 1.25.

And the night version is already done! 
https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j93cli/finished_with_the_night_version_of_the_cgi_render/"
cyberpunkgame,Render time for that res with 12000 samples took around 5hrs.
cyberpunkgame,Always ready 😁 And thanks!!
cyberpunkgame,"Yeah true! Especially with the PC i got now, its a miracle i could even get it working lol.
And thanks!!"
cyberpunkgame,To clear the noise at least a bit it took around 5hrs and the entire project with building up the city is around 150hrs.
cyberpunkgame,Thanks a lot for the support man!
cyberpunkgame,Thank you ! Unfortunately my pc can go just this far for now 😂 Need a better gpu so render times are.faster and I can go to higher res.
Cinema4D,"The city took around 150hrs to model. 

And I don't have an insta for posting renders cuz I started off with reddit. I'll possibly make one and let you know ☺️"

You can crop it as per your choice cuz i didnt want to resize the image in anyway. And I've also posted my Foggy version!"
cyberpunkgame,"Hey y'all! Before i start, just wanna thank you all for being so supportive with my projects and giving me ideas to do more and progress further pushing into exploring new boundaries. Everyone has been really helpful with these and its been an amazing 4 month journey with this project! I've lost count on how much hours ive put into this project but i know that every second i spent on this is fully worth it <3 Thanks for everything!

&#x200B;

For those of you don't know, this is the day version and the night version of the projects,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j1a4up/finally\_finished\_recreating\_a\_full\_scene\_from\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j1a4up/finally_finished_recreating_a_full_scene_from_the/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j93cli/finished\_with\_the\_night\_version\_of\_the\_cgi\_render/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j93cli/finished_with_the_night_version_of_the_cgi_render/)

&#x200B;

Since y'all suggested to do a more atmospheric scene with fog I thought of some new ideas to go with and here's what I could come up with! 

Night city in 2077 has its amazing weather conditions in the game so wanted to make it similar to that as much as possible! 

&#x200B;

Technical details - Total amount of objects in the scene is around 1000-1020. Total polygons around 4-5M, Render engine is Octane and modelled completely in Cinema 4D

&#x200B;

Resource for the logos- All the title logos of the game; i got it from here [https://www.valencygraphics.com/cyberpunk-2077](https://www.valencygraphics.com/cyberpunk-2077). It was very useful in making the render more authentic as it is in the game.

&#x200B;

Resource for ads- Got most of the ads from the trailer and screenshotted them. And also the new nightcity website helped me to get a lot more ads for the scene!

&#x200B;

Once again, thanks to everyone who supported me in the first project!! It means a lot!! :) Also thanks to my friends on discord for keeping me motivated. I know you're reading this and you're the best!

And my next project will probably be something from the game once its out!

&#x200B;

See y'all in Night city!"

Avoid ""my first"" posts if you can
Please try to not qualify your work or yourself in the post title as “beginner, my first, quick, I am only 10 years old, only my second, etc…“. You should mention these things in the comment section. Usually a title like this either excuses the quality of your work or serves to humbly brag.

This is not a warning, we just try to discourage these types of titles and the best way to do that is to paste this everywhere so most people hopefully will see it."
cyberpunkgame,Thank you kindly!
Cinema4D,"Those are some good points! Thanks for taking your time with it!

I do have ideas to do a different weather this time with fog but with an overcast sky. 
As for humans i wanted to add at least a car but the ones ive made before for cp2077 are really intense in poly count and would crash my render cuz i have an old gpu xD
And you're right about the wetness, i should've added a bit of it on the buildings atleast on the front!"
cyberpunkgame,Absolutely! I hoping to go down that path as well!
cyberpunkgame,Thanks!!
cyberpunkgame,I dont have one setup yet but I'll do it as soon as possible!
3Dmodeling,That's the first ever software i used to pretty much stuck with it. It's got an easier interface compared to maya and 3ds. Only downside is the render engine its got by default. i hear the new version has redshift but i prefer octane than that one.
3Dmodeling,"Ahhh gotchu. 
Have you tried cinema 4d?"
cyberpunkgame,Feel free to! And thanks!!!
3Dmodeling,Yep xD There's a ton of em lol And had to choose each of em one by one and map the textures etc etc lots of stuff went through xD
Cinema4D,Sure would be glad to hear as much as critiques/thoughts as possible! Helps me improve!
cyberpunkgame,"Damn thanks for those words man! Will surely work on more!! 

Next one i got planned is a very foggy one as the screenshot released by cdpr. Yellowish fog and rainy weather"
cyberpunkgame,Appreciate that man!
cyberpunkgame,Thank you!! Cant wait for nov !!

cyberpunkgame,Thanks for supporting bruh!
cyberpunkgame,Noice. thancc bruh :D
cyberpunkgame,"Thanks!
That's relatable xD"
cyberpunkgame,Thanks for the input! Will work on those!
cyberpunkgame,Thank you!!
cyberpunkgame,"Hey y'all! For those of you don't know, this is the day version of the project [https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j1a4up/finally\_finished\_recreating\_a\_full\_scene\_from\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/j1a4up/finally_finished_recreating_a_full_scene_from_the/)

&#x200B;

I had ideas to make the night version even when working on the day one! Cuz night city has to be showcased at its beauty at night! I hope I've done enough!! If not, i apologize in advance! Did my best!

For my last one, I'm planning to do one more weather which is fog as in one of the cp2077 screenshots. I'll be starting that in a few days and this project will be finished as a set!

&#x200B;

Technical details - Total amount of objects in the scene is around 1000-1020. Total polygons around 4-5M, Render engine is Octane and modelled completely in Cinema 4D

&#x200B;

Resource for the logos- All the title logos of the game; i got it from here [https://www.valencygraphics.com/cyberpunk-2077](https://www.valencygraphics.com/cyberpunk-2077). It was very useful in making the render more authentic as it is in the game.

&#x200B;

Resource for ads- Got most of the ads from the trailer and screenshotted them. And also the new nightcity website helped me to get a lot more ads for the scene!

&#x200B;

Once again, thanks to everyone who supported me in the first project!! It means a lot!! :) Also thanks to my friends on discord for keeping me motivated. I know you're reading this and you're the best!

&#x200B;

Hope y'all liked this project! 

See you in the fog!"

Avoid ""my first"" posts if you can
Please try to not qualify your work or yourself in the post title as “beginner, my first, quick, I am only 10 years old, only my second, etc…“. You should mention these things in the comment section. Usually a title like this either excuses the quality of your work or serves to humbly brag.

Cinema4D,Octane has improved a lot and its really good! You could try the demo versions if you wanna test it out.
cyberpunkgame,Thank you!
cyberpunkgame,Next up will be a night version of this scene with everything bright and street lights lit up past rain!

3Dmodeling,Lighting is a daylight object in octane with camera imager turned on and custom gamma settings with different sun color. Also using an HDRI for the sky(only visiblility) and post processing on octane
cyberpunkgame,"NOICE 
Thanks for the support bruh :pepesalute:"
Cinema4D,Oh yeah that's true especially with heavy poly objects and multiple of em in the scene. Sometimes i try to change the edge smoothness to make it a bit smoother in the viewport. And thanks!!
Cinema4D,"I used around 2500 samples on path tracing, took about nearly an hour 30 or 45. And did it on a 780ti so its pretty old."
3Dmodeling,Thanks a lot!!
cyberpunkgame,They're professionals and I'm a noob so probably half the time taken or even less and a way better job than this in a short time I'd say.
cyberpunkgame,Thanks for that man! I'm no where near to the skill levels of the people in CDPR but would be amazing one day to work with them!
Cinema4D,I used the octane render engine with path-tracing. And thanks!
cyberpunkgame,Done in cinema4d! And I'm sure you will soon enough! Keep pushing!
3Dmodeling,Everything is modelled by me.
cyberpunkgame,"Full path-tracing all the time! Never use direct lighting at all haha. 
And can't wait to see what you come up with!"
cyberpunkgame,Thank you! I used the camera imager with a bit of bloom and a lower gamma level. Also using octane daylight with a hdri for the sky but only for visibility. And with the camera imager set to ektachrome.
cyberpunkgame,Thanks for the thoughts! Will remember that when working on it again!
3Dmodeling,Thank you!
cyberpunkgame,Absolutely! Anything to help you get started with your work! Good luck with it!!
cyberpunkgame,Thank you!!
cyberpunkgame,It's made in Cinema 4D+Octane engine; mainly a CG program for trailers and such. I could do different scenes for sure! Next one would be the same scene but at night time after rains.
cyberpunkgame,Thanks!! I used Cinema 4D for the modelling process and Rendering using octane path tracing engine(including texturing)
cyberpunkgame,"Haha, I'm sure you'll get faster in time with practice!! Keep doing it!"
cyberpunkgame,Thank you kindly!
cyberpunkgame,Thanks for the support :D
