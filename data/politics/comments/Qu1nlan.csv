politics,I very strongly recommend looking up the (thousands of years of) history of trans folks.
politics,Sure. Quite a lot of the country also used to  disagree that black folks were equal to white folks. Bigotry takes time to weed out. It sucks.
politics,Trans women are women.
politics,God I wish
politics,Trans women are women.
politics,Trans women are women.
politics,How exactly is a bill targeting trans people in a negative fashion not against them?
politics,"""Just because she's pushing through unnecessary legislation targeting transgender people based on transphobic lies doesn't mean she's against transgender people!"""
politics,"Yes, it is."
politics,"Ah yes, separate but equal! Would you also prefer trans-only water fountains and bus sections?"
politics,Transgender women are women.
politics,Is this a copypasta?
politics,A person who doesn't fully support trans people transitioning is not my ally.
politics,"That's such a shitty, dismissive take on the literal thousands of trans kids dead by their own hand."
politics,Edgy
politics,"Or just a responsible, non-abusive parent who doesn't want their child to be suicidal."
politics,Trans folks in many states can correct their birth certificates with their accurate gender.
politics,I suggest modernizing your scientific education.
politics,Key words - before transitioning. A transition makes a lot of equalizing changes to a person's body.
politics,"What about women that were born without your exact preferred combination of chromosomes, but aren't trans? Sex and gender is way more complicated than this comment implies."
politics,"To me, the height of ignorance is demanding inequality for oppressed groups before doing actual research on the issue. In this case, going through a transition \*hugely\* equalizes that playing field."
politics,"Ah yes, nothing says ""good bill"" like ""government mandated panic over who has what genitals"""
politics,"What perpetuates negative feelings towards trans folks is this mindset of keeping them separate from the ""REAL people"". They're equal. They always have been. I encourage you to do some reading on what a transition does to a person's body."
politics,I support trans rights unconditionally.
politics,"This is actually not true, since many states thankfully allow trans folks to change their birth certificate :)"

assassinscreed,"Yep, exactly - there's a limit on how much you can get, and that limit isn't enough for the altar, the quiver, and the rations."
assassinscreed,Excited that the fabric limit was addressed - I should be able to get the platinum trophy now!
Wishlist,"Morning pals :). I've collected both pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh cards, but never seriously. My old pokémon cards from the 90s are fun to pull out and look at sometimes."
politics,"You act like because something is better than literal prison it's totally fine. 

Mandatory rehab is expensive, difficult, and can cause huge issues in relationships and employment."
politics,It really fucking isn't. Being forced into difficult and expensive mandatory programs for something that doesn't hurt anyone else is an authoritarian horror.
politics,">advocate for drugs to be legal.

decades ahead of you."
politics,"That's such a nihilistic view to take, though. ""It's so great they're easing the boot off our throat"". I want the boot gone."
politics,"Yeah, they suck, and under this plan they'd suck less. Doesn't mean they don't suck."
politics,"Sure they should - if they want to. They shouldn't be forced into an expensive, difficult program by the government for a personal choice that they made."
politics,"Sure - rehab is way better than prison. Let's make rehab free, publicly available, and \*optional\*."
politics,"Why are we saying that just because something is better than the status quo, it's okay? They've stopped shooting us so that they can beat us and we're taking it with a smile?"
politics,"Yes, nothing says ""a positive"" like ""when someone does something personal in the privacy of their own home and the government finds out, force them into expensive and damninig mandatory rehab"".

Fuck Joe Biden, fuck Kamala Harris, and fuck their continuation of Reagan's drug war."
politics,"""Mandatory rehabilitation"" is a warped fucking idea of ""help""."
politics,"I have personally used hard drugs. Pretty sure I'm happier sitting here in my home than I'd be in ""Joe Biden's Fun Happy Liberal Authoritarian Reprogramming Center""."
politics,Mandatory rehabilitation for personal drug use is some horrific authoritarian shit. Biden not being as bad as Trump doesn't mean he's not awful.
hmmm,Yikes.

politics,"I see your happiness, and I am happy for you. I am happy for my queer friends and friends of color, I'm happy for my women friends, I'm happy for my immigrant friends.


But we need to not mince words: this is not a win. This is success in having picked a lesser evil.


Joe Biden is a rich, ancient, cishet, white man with a horrifyingly racist and warmongering record, whose own VP believed sexual assault allegations against. He loves capitalism, he loves cops, he hates ""riots"" and wants protestors arrested and/or shot in the legs.

 
Please don't stop caring about kids in cages - cages that the Obama/Biden administration built. Please don't stop caring about BLM - and the thousands of folks jailed for drug charges under Kamala Harris. I'm not going to stop fighting because the better bad guys won.

Between you and me, I'm just a 20-something guy in Northern California who fucks around on Reddit in my recliner on my free time. Even if we choose to buy into the idea that the literal GRU is paying someone to get on the mod team of a subreddit (which, no, I do not think): how would you expect us to keep out literal government-sponsored spies? We do not have IP tools, we're not going to force new mods to doxx themselves to get on the team. If you have any ideas on how a handful of internet volunteers can combat a multi-billion-dollar foreign spy apparatus which you think is coming to get us, I'd love to hear them.

Really though, we have a lot of red tape on this team and a significant amount of inter-moderator oversight. If one mod was going against team consensus to moderate in a way the rest of us did not approve, they wouldn't last long."

If your first impression of harm coming to someone is ""I don't care about that"", it's best to not comment."
politics,"\>chunky FtW

I have the power to ban you and I *will* exercise it."
politics,"Hi! Happy to address this, but I want to make sure I understand completely first. The issue was that one article was paywalled, and the other one was copy/pasted? Or that the other one was not on the approved domains list?

In the first case, in which a copy/pasted article by the original author was removed because it was first behind a paywalled source - that's something I'd actually modmail about next time, that's an interesting case and we may be able to have a mod discussion about what to do.

If the latter case happened though, and it's either paywall or a non-approved source, there's not much we can do there. There are many authors whose work can simply not be posted due to them not being published in approved domains."
politics,I have no shortcomings not even one how dare you
politics,"We disallow solicitation for donations/volunteering. Linking to a campaign page for something like issues is fine, but not for soliciting - even if you're unassociated."
politics,"We are not Netflix. We are a few dozen folks with very limited tooling who volunteer our spare time to make an internet forum operate a bit better. We would sincerely love IP tools, along with many other tools - but that's something that needs to be taken upstairs to the paid Reddit admins."
politics,"We do have numerous piece-meal age gate systems. That said, it's not something we want to do in excess and it's not something we want to do for every thread - we're an online hub for political discussion, and right before a major election we want to welcome new voices who are politically interested."
politics,"I'm afraid there are assumptions being made here that aren't quite correct.

If we find a significance of submitted articles from a source that advocate for hate speech or violence, we in fact \*will\* evaluate those entire sources for exclusion from our approved domains list. We don't want that type of content on our subreddit at all.

What we can't do as mods is read into the articles and entire sources the way it sounds like you want us to - we can't assume that because a source is ""alt-right"", the entire thing is deserving of exclusion. We don't take stances like that based on political affiliation, we take stances like that based on very \*objective\* metrics, such as clear hate speech or calls for violence in submitted articles."
politics,"We don't have access to IP tools. Even if we did, banning discussion from every user in an entire country we deemed ""malicious"" seems like an extreme overreach to me.

We have, as Pyyric said, numerous pieces of automation to prevent non-civil discussion."
politics,"We evaluate for article content, not rumored thoughts of platform editors. Again: If you at any point see an article from \*any\* source that clearly exercises hate speech, please report it. That is a tangible  issue that we can and will act on."
politics,"If you see that someone has submitted an article from \*any\* source that advocates for white supremacy, please report it to us. We will evaluate it and if we agree, we will remove it and ban the submitter permanently."
politics,"We do have a rule against state-sponsored propaganda - but we do not at this time have reason to believe that any of the outlets you listed are state-sponsored.

We understand that these outlets can be very controversial, but we expect users to take care of that with their votes. Whenever you see a submission advocating hate speech or violence, feel free to report it for us to look at - we will remove those and even ban the submitter if we feel the same way.

Remember: Our approved domain list is not an endorsement by the mods. It's just a signal of notability."

Wishlist,":O Wow, I can't believe you've never seen any Star Wars! I'd recommend Rogue One. It's a fun ride, and should be pretty accessible to newcomers as it's a one-off story and not part of a huge nine-movie saga. 

As for the Assassin's Creed franchise, I'd recommend Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag. Feels pretty modern still, really gorgeous and fun, also pretty accessible for newcomers. 

For Kingdom Hearts, uh... gosh, if you're not into it already, I honestly would wait for the next series to start haha. Kingdom Hearts 3 just ended a years-long saga spanning like 8 cross-console games, and the story is extremely convoluted and inaccessible unless you at least read up on all of them."
Wishlist,"Never got much into Fire Emblem, but I also love Mass Effect and Dragon Age! My favorite series are probably Assassin's Creed, Kingdom Hearts, and... uh...

Thanks so much for this AMA. I really respect what you did to the GOP here, and I love your anti-cop platform. We need more subversion of authority like that.

One thing I do want to challenge you on, however. My understanding is that you are not in fact an anarchist (which I am), but an “anarcho”-*capitalist*. I’d like to understand why, as a trans person, a satanist, and a fellow hater of cops, you would want to maintain capitalism - even further, unrestrained capitalism. Why replace federal cops with McCops? Why replace government-permitted discrimination with corporate-mandated discrimination? Would not a society based on total equity, no cops at all, and mutual aid be better to meet those goals?"

They've got no stuffing so can't make a mess all over the house, but they still make fun crinkly noises that dogs love. Great for tug, great for chew, great for shaking around the way dogs do.

politics,">Lmao still going with the ol' creepy biden thing huh?

He's on camera doing it multiple times so yes

>Yep. The bill endorsed by the congressional black caucus.

Shocking, a bunch of rich powerful people didn't want what was good for poor and disenfranchised people. Even that said, if you look up articles about it, it's pretty clear the CBC wasn't in love with it.

>Just throwing words out huh

He picked Kamala Harris as VP amidst nation-wide anti-police protests. 

>And a straight up lie

He's *still* fighting against universal single-payer."
politics,I can offer a critique of viewpoints constantly looking to Russia when domestic policy or internal candidates are being discussed.
politics,"I find the impassioned defenses of a child-sniffing, crime bill-sponsoring, cop-loving, health care-denying old man from liberals, similarly old. 

I'm not saying we shouldn't elect Biden over Trump. We totally should. I hope he wins. I just hope we stop worshipping him too. Because he sucks."
politics,I didn't say Joe Biden was the same as Donald Trump. What I am saying is that dogmatic support of Joe Biden is the same as dogmatic support of Donald Trump. I'm indeed saying Joe Biden is evil - and pretending that evil people can do no wrong is fuckin' \*Scary\*.
politics,I'm doing... what now? I'm not supporting Bernie. Not every person left of Joe Biden is a Bernie Sanders worshipper.
politics,"You are, once again, putting words in my mouth. I neither know nor care what Putin wants. I just think it's fucking silly as hell that liberals can't see a leftist critique of their terrible candidates without side-eyeing \*literally Russia\*."
politics,"I'm also afraid of Fascism, but again, Trump supporters would literally say ""Trump isn't a communist, he wants to do good things, Biden wants to kill us"".

Biden is better than Trump. Not disputing that. But we need to stop pretending he's good, instead of just a lesser evil."
politics,"Lol, no. The point I made in the first place, and absolutely stand by, is that modern ""RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA"" conspiracy theorists sound no different than post-9/11 ""MUSLIM MUSLIM MUSLIM"" conspiracy theorists."
politics,"Never said they were the same. Just said they were both evil. Biden may be better than Trump, that doesn't make him good."
politics,"That, to me, is a \*scary\* thing to say. I would expect the same thing with the names reversed to come out of a Trump supporter's mouth. 

I think the much wiser thing is to say that both people are trash and capable of doing excessively fucking evil things. And we need to do all we can to stop them both from doing those things."
politics,They said Russia funnels money into Jacobin?
Wishlist,"/u/Mamallama is gettin' ""Dune Messiah"" because the upcoming Dune movie has got Oscar Isaac in it and y'all *know* how I feel about Oscar Isaac."
politics,I never said either of those things. What I said is that the idea that Vladimir Putin personally and illicitly funnels money into any sources critical of Joe Biden is a \*weird\* conspiracy.
politics,"I have literally no idea whether Putin would like it.  I also don't \*care\* whether Putin would like it. Furthermore, Putin liking or not liking something is entirely divorced from him \*sponsoring\* something. That is a weird conspiracy."
politics,"I'm really not sure how to counter that. It just feels very much to me like 2001-2002, post 9/11, when everyone was looking over their shoulder and screaming ""ARAB TERRORISTS!!"" into their soup."
politics,"I'm just not clear on why the answer to anything left of a crime bill cop loving centrist is ""RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA""."
politics,"In what way is ""is X paid by Russia"" the opposite of ""is X Russian""?"
politics,"No because I'm not constantly biting my nails over Russia when I'm thinking about American politics. I'm more concerned about the fuckers leading our own country.

She was hanging out with her brother in the park at night, and they decided to stop at the swings. They were swinging and chatting, when my roommate got an uneasy feeling. She subtly glanced over and saw a dark figure sitting on the bench not even 10 feet away. In the pitch dark deserted park. At 2am. Not wanting to scream and run, she kept up the conversation with her brother, but subtly started implying they should move on. He didn't want to, though, he liked the swings. She started more and more urgently making these implications, and finally decided to simply get up and walk away, making her brother follow.

He falls in love with someone who loves him back deeply, and throughout he commits terrible acts in the name of ultimately defeating Hitler. It's a miserable, wonderful book."

Wishlist,"Aaah, yay yay yay! I have a BUNCH of board games on my wishlist, as I've been trying to build up my collection for a while. I love playing with my roommate. 

My favorite party game:

* Conspiracy Theory. The basic mechanics are similar to Cards Against Humanity, but each card is based on a conspiracy (""aliens"", ""chem trails"", ""JFK"") and you need to defend your play to explain why it's the most plausible conspiracy

Favorite snack:

* I've been really jamming to chips and french onion dip lately.

Favorite memory:

* Ooooh, that one is really tough. Probably something involving Disneyland? It's a favorite place of mine and I have adored every time I've been there."

Barack Obama literally did this while Joe Biden, at best, sat by."
politics,"I mean, he literally doesn't need my vote. Thanks to the Electoral College, millions of people in blue states could stay home and he'd still win or not win as normal. The EC is fucking evil."
politics,Not at all. I see voting for a candidate as condoning them. I'm not voting for the GOP. I'm not voting for either major party. Because fuck both of them.
politics,"Yeah, because a single individual voting blue from a state that will go blue by literal millions is a true message."
politics,😂 Is every take that is against Biden literally Russian?
politics,"Not much of a message, but yes, that's part of it. I send a greater message by not voting than I do by voting. Also, I walk away with a clean conscience of not having condoned someone I see as evil with my vote."
politics,"I mean, it's not really a \*feeling\* that my vote is useless - it's an objective fact due to the Electoral College. I could convince every single person I know to not vote, and California would still go to Biden. There is no reason for me to vote for Biden here, and several reasons for me not to."
politics,Tempting
politics,I plan to vote as left as possible downballot.
politics,"If I were in a red or purple state I'd hold my nose and vote for Biden. I'm in California, which is a solid blue state where my individual vote does not matter due to the Electoral College. Therefore I'm boycotting him entirely."
