LegalAdviceUK,"You have two options really

- enforce the original contract

- accept your landlord is being exceptionally generous and just move on

The third one which I think you are hoping for where the contract becomes void doesn't exist in this scenario."
LegalAdviceUK,"They can't change a term which makes it worse for you. From what you have so far said they are going out of their way to make reasonable adjustments that benefit you.

You can if you so wish enforce the original contract, not have a flexible start date and revert back to the original notice which seems to have long since past."
LegalAdviceUK,"I'm sorry I am slightly confused by the explanation, you signed the agreement last year and you would have then had 3 days from that point to cancel?

It sounds like betterment if they are then allowing you to cancel the agreement within 3 days of your country banning travel to the UK."
LegalAdviceUK,"It does need to be declared by a trader if the car is Cat S or Cat N (written off by an insurance company).

It may be worth a small amount of money checking with one of the many only companies that provides a car report. If they haven't declared a Cat S or N than you may have case to get a refund."
LegalAdviceUK,What does the contract say about cancelling the tenancy agreement and what has he tried to change it to?
LegalAdviceUK,"It will be based on the complete delivery, and its 14 days. Otherwise a company could just send a screw and then the actual goods 14 days later to avoid refunds."
LegalAdviceUK,"Six years is usually chosen as a time period for many companies for either legal requirements or because this generally the time period for which a legal claim can be made (and you want to be able to defend against it)

A financial services firm needs to keep information about a transaction for a period at least five years and no more than ten, under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017. 

It could be deleted but that's why I said, see if.."
LegalAdviceUK,"The father can still be the nominated individual, but it then becomes up to the platform. Transferring in cash is usually very minimal in cost which is what you would need to do.

The money legally becomes the child's at 18, no one has any legal right to direct what happens to that money so while your intention may be that it is used for retirement, that remains completely up to them. Any agreements otherwise will be void.

Is there no similar types of accounts which allow investments where you are already based which you can explore first?"
LegalAdviceUK,"I mean technical if the child were to live with the father, then yes. For yourself, its unlikely. It is parental responsibility in the legal sense. It seems like quite a bit of effort to get a year head start. Why not just invest the money separately and move it into the Junior ISA when its open?"
LegalAdviceUK,"The **child** needs to live in the UK at the point of application and the nominated individual needs to be someone with parental responsibility. Junior ISAs have unusual relationship with tax residency as contributions can be made from outside of the UK if the provider supports this, the child also does not need to remain a resident."

ALL children have an equal share, its sounds like there are three of you?

You will need to value the estate - have you any idea of how much this would be?"
LegalAdviceUK,"The issue you will have is getting ID issued in such a name and organisations taking you seriously. You would need to actually use the name for example and its going to tire people out fairly quickly.

They will be more concerned if you start trying to pretend its a title / position i.e its an issue to change your firstname to Princess to pretend you are one (though there are plenty of people legally with that as a first name).

Chuck it in as middle name or something would be my suggestion."
LegalAdviceUK,"It is very unlikely then imo. You can report it to your bank and to the police. If they are actually a registered company in the UK you could make a claim but I am assuming they are not, nor do they hold FCA permissions?

If a client were to still have issues with accessing we would usually consider finding alternative ways of sending the information, there are various secure transfer system which use OTP for example which could be used instead.

LegalAdviceUK,"A company will almost always prefer you resign a contract at the earliest opportunity and you will be fine providing such notice as outlined within the contract.

It would be more frustrating for them to be told just as you start which then gives no opportunity to find a replacement.

LegalAdviceUK,"The definition of support group is defined within the legislation for the purpose of this lockdown (and actually in the risk based lockdowns as well) this is

> For the purposes of paragraph (6), “support group” means a group or one to one support which is organised by a business, a charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institution or a public body to provide mutual aid, therapy or any other form of support to its members or those who attend its meetings, for example those providing support—

> (a) to victims of crime (including domestic abuse);  
> (b) to those with, or recovering from, addictions (including alcohol, narcotics or other substance addictions) or addictive patterns of behaviour;  
(c) to new parents;  
(d) to those with, or caring for persons with, any long-term illness or terminal condition or who are vulnerable;  
(e) to those facing issues related to their sexuality or identity including those living as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender;  
(f) to those who have suffered bereavement;  
(g) to vulnerable young people.  

It would be up to a court ultimately if your group qualified, personally I suspect not and I would imagine it would be seen as an attempt to circumvent the rules. Otherwise you would see gyms have 'support' groups to help alleviate loneliness through working out each morning."

Take a note of interactions in some form of diary. For responding to the council I would just respond that they are unaware of what issues there may be, could they provide some more infomation? It will likely be the landlord in trouble for the property in disrepair not the tenant, and the council can require them to remedy any problems. You have protection from eviction for a period if this occured.

As a rented property, the landlord will legally need to check the electrics of the house before April anyway"

LegalAdviceUK,Yes its a fairly simple chargeback; even if the goods arrived and are counterfeit it can be claimed back. Mastercard for example has a specific counterfeit email for banks to use in these cases to supplement the chargeback.
LegalAdviceUK,"OK if a mechanic is saying that regarding the oil leak then yes you can ask the dealership for a repair under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. If that is in writing its easier, but as its within six months it would be for the dealership to show it was fine when it was sold."
LegalAdviceUK,"As far as I am aware, the same protections apply for unfair dismissal for both fixed term contract employees and permanent employees. The expiration of a contract is a dismissal not the end of a relationship when it comes to employment."
LegalAdviceUK,"Its going to depend on whats wrong, how long you have had the car, should you have been reasonably aware of the faults when you purchased the car.

Some more details would be helpful."
LegalAdviceUK,"If they should have been considered a permanent employee, what remedy are you seeking here?

FTC or not, they have been dismissed and the obligations for a dismissal still stand. This may mean the possibility for an unfair dismissal claim or claim for redundancy. 

Speak to ACAS who can begin the process for such a claim."
LegalAdviceUK,"If he does fire you and its over minimum wage, go to ACAS and start their process. He will need to show you were fired for the other reason and not because you raised such an issue. The fact he has withheld pay already doesn't put him in good light.

Do also report it to HMRC which can be done here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pay-and-work-rights-complaints"
LegalAdviceUK,"Most of the time if you are fired within two years of employment, you have no right to raise a tribunal case. There are however some exceptions to this where something is considered automatically unfair and a tribunal go through, this includes issues over minimum wage as well as some issues regarding holiday and working time.

See here [Citizens Advice on Automatically unfair](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/work/problems-at-work/employment-tribunals-from-29-july-2013/making-an-employment-tribunal-claim-is-it-worth-it/employment-tribunals-automatic-unfair-dismissal/employment-tribunals-automatic-unfair-dismissal-trying-to-assert-a-statutory-right/)"
LegalAdviceUK,"As someone has pointed out, raise a grievance, you must legally be paid minimum wage for what is worked. They can report this to HMRC for failure to adhere to minimum wage rules.

Regarding getting information on being in, the General Data Protection Regulations will mean that information on what security may have regarding signing in needs to be provided upon request.

If they are fired and you believe this is because of the grievance or ACAS early conciliation then this will be automatically unfair and possible to go to tribunal. The issue is the employer will usually try and find something else to fire someone with."
LegalAdviceUK,"I can't see how this would be legal, especially if it takes them below minimum wage. If it can be shown by security that they have worked then payment should be made.

How long have they worked there for?

ACAS is a good place to go, and can also start early reconciliation if appropriate to reclaim what is owed."
LegalAdviceUK,"Its tough and I have had to have this conversation with my sister who wants her 1Y son to come with me if anything were to happen and wrote a very long letter basically begging that the father didn't get custody.

It is now in a will, but have had to be very upfront that its not my decision and while I will do everything I can, ultimately a court/social care will decide what is in the best interest of the child."
LegalAdviceUK,"Take a look here: https://www.housingrights.org.uk/news/another-landlord-fined-%C2%A320k-issuing-sham-licence-agreements

You can always speak to shelter. In many cases, these are actually tenancy agreements not licence agreements and the landlord can get into a heap of trouble. If its not for work, education, a hostel type situation like YMCA than its usually a tenancy regardless of any agreement.

You may also want to report to the council. If you do have a tenancy agreement and your deposit is not protected you can make a claim. 

If you have moved out, you can decide to just get the deposit back or do a little bit more extra work and claim for 3x deposit. If you go with just the deposit, tell the agency that if they fail to transfer the money to you, that you will sue them for compensation for failure to protect the deposit, for compensation under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and report them to the council who may prosecute leading to a significant fine.

If you want to get what you are entitled to with regards to everything - send a letter before action asking for 3x deposit, the actual return of the deposit and compensation for their unfair trading practices."

LegalAdviceUK,"Potentially yes, especially if they are in the same business type and location. 

If Shine cleaning were a national and established cleaning company, you are going to have problems. If they are a small local company based on Glasgow while your company is in Birmingham you are probably ok.

This all depends on them not actually holding a trademark"
LegalAdviceUK,"If the accounts have been closed the payment should bounce back to your employer who can then arrange payment. The exceptions are usually Santander and Nationwide who for some reason are poor at properly closing accounts.

You should also contact your previous bank and explain the situation, they should have policies for this type of occurrence as it isn't that rare. Providing a payslip with the confirmed amount for example may help.

You should ask the employer if they can have some form of advance due to their error. Refusing to work isn't going to get you anywhere, nor do I believe a tribunal will (though there is no harm speaking to ACAS). What you may look at is asking your employer to cover the loss you have incurred."
LegalAdviceUK,"Did the advertisement state the specifications and are those present within the computer? As its over 30 days you can no longer use a short-term right to reject so yes they can have an opportunity to make sure the goods conform to the description and work.

LegalAdviceUK,Section 21 paperwork is on the government website with some guidance. You don't need the agent to serve it.
LegalAdviceUK,Yes a mutual agreement to surrender the tenancy is perfectly fine as long as it is that an agreement not a demand.
LegalAdviceUK,"It's your new banks responsibility to look into under the guarantee. Get proof of deposit from your employer and take it to the bank.

If you were to incur any fees including overdraft it should be refunded by your new bank."
LegalAdviceUK,"Saying you are accountable would not be sufficient organisational measures to protection customer information. They should be ensuring the computer is encrypted for example.

Your tenants will still have a contract it will just be a statutory or contractual periodic tenancy on and month by month basis. 

You can always just go direct to the tenants and communicate with them, it may not absolve your obligations to the agency on their fee but you may be able to make an agreement with the tenants regarding viewings (though they can of course refuse especially during the pandemic)"
LegalAdviceUK,"Its an offence under S54 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, liable to a summary fine. You could report it to the police on 101, you may need to highlight it is a criminal offence you are pursuing, not a civil matter.

The other option is to tell the company that if its not removed plus your costs, you will be reporting their illegal behavior to the police.

This is dependent on it not being a baliff company acting on a courts order to recover funds."
LegalAdviceUK,"A s75 claim is against Tandem not Virgin, did Tandem instead issue a chargeback under a Cardholder dispute? It would be prudent for them to do so depending on the cost (15 EUR loss vs $$$ for a Australia flight).

A service being non-refundable based on the non-execution of that service, to the decision only of the air line I would assume would be an unfair term under Schedule 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015. I haven't had enough time to really look into the whole airline non-refund angle so its a place to look or someone may be able to chip in.

Continue pursuing Tandem, put a complaint in if needed reminding them that the claim is against them."

If they continue to fail to correct your name, you will need to pursue a complaint through the Information Commissioners Office.

Flying to finalise a business deal sounds like work."
LegalAdviceUK,"In short yes you can go by a single name, as long as you can show you are actually going by that single name in all instances (it will become more difficult if you in some places still use a surname).

For technical purposes on a passport you are known by a surname with the forname as XXX.

I will say that it will probably cause more problems then it will solve as it is extremely unusual from a legal name sense. I have seen maybe two and the reason I know about them is because I have these cases escalated to me with a WTF, is this legal question.

Most systems are wired to accept a forename plus surname, you will often need to suppliment in a surname / forename somewhere (possible with an X like the passport).

If you want to go ahead, you can create a deed poll; this may be one of those cases I would encourage an enrolled deed poll just to cement in that you are known as one name. https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts

I don't believe it should be disclosed in such a reference, it doesn't mean they won't find out but I think it will be outside of the scope of the regime.

LegalAdviceUK,"So your new firm may want to complete a regulatory reference under the SMCR regime which is to assess if you are fit and proper person. 

This will depend on your role and if it is within scope of SMCR; as a financial advisor if you are continuing on with such aspects of the role then this falls within being certified by the principle firm. However, AR firms don't necessarily fall within scope if your roles isn't covered by the regime itself.

A PIP won't necessary come up within the regulatory reference which is usually focused upon disciplinary action, it then comes down to if your firm has concluded that you are not fit and proper to perform a function. The questions your previous firms need to provide is included within the FCA handbook SYSC 22 Annex 1 (https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/22/Annex1.html)

If I am making some guesses and you are setting up a partner practice for SJP, then SJP need to undergo the referencing as you would still be conducting regulated activities which is caught by the certification regime. I do believe it is for the principle to then certify you, they then inform the FCA that you are an AR."

LegalAdviceUK,I assume the car on finance was purchased through them? If so and they were arranging the finance then they would usually retain a copy for compliance with financial regulations such as the Money Laundering Regulations 2017
LegalAdviceUK,"Someone may correct me if I am wrong:

It sounds like they have tried to give you a licence agreement instead of a tenancy. There are some valid uses of a licence such as if you are in a hotel / hostel or where accommodation is with an education provider or employer.

An example would be YMCA accommodation.

What can sometimes happen is a landlord will have a 'sham agreement' where they try to use a licence rather than a tenancy agreement. The reason for this is that a licence has protections and more restrictions (such as a limit on guests).

You can see some information here: https://landlordlawblog.co.uk/2013/01/15/renting-property-on-a-license/

What it is important to establish at the moment, is to determine if you should have a tenancy agreement instead of a licence.

If they are incorrectly using a licence they could be prosecuted with a very hefty fine: https://www.housingrights.org.uk/news/another-landlord-fined-%C2%A320k-issuing-sham-licence-agreements"
LegalAdviceUK,For something like this /r/UKPersonalFinance  may be helpful
LegalAdviceUK,"Ok it sounds like they have tried to give you a ~~commercia~~l licence rather than a residential tenancy agreement. Basically the law will recognise you have a residential tenancy regardless of what the landlord is attempting to do.

Did you pay a deposit to live in the property and if so do you know if they protected this with a deposit scheme?"
LegalAdviceUK,"You say in your licence agreement, but in a Studio? I assume the landlord does not live with you and its not something like a educational institution owned property?

Just trying to establish if you have what should be an assured shorthold tenancy as opposed to a licence (the landlord doesn't get to choose)"
LegalAdviceUK,"Ok; so you could claim there was a data breach by sharing your information as the photographer. I don't see why this would need to be shared by the landlord for the purpose of meeting a legitimate aim.

The photographs, unless you were within them are not a data breach against yourself (its not your personal data contained within them), it is then a case I understand of copyright.

Regarding the photographs themselves, the sharing of those photographs to me is to achieve a legitimate aim (as a reason for processing) in that you want such a behaviour to stop and that reason overrides the individuals within the photo right to privacy. 

You do need to have some more care regarding children but again I think the legitimate aim is clear here to continue processing. If they make a complaint about such images (what is called an objection) there may be a reason to delete them, however, if you are continuing with such a complaint to the council retaining them for that period is probably going to be fine."
LegalAdviceUK,"Sorry its probably my fault for not understanding your post but

- Who took the photos?
- What are the photos of?
- What other personal data was shared?
- Who shared this and to who was it shared with?"
LegalAdviceUK,"You would likely need to show negligence on the woodland trust's part which I don't believe you will be able to do.

LegalAdviceUK,Realistically? Speak to the test center in case there is something they can do and order a new licence. Its likely you won't be able to take the test so will need to get the test rebooked.
LegalAdviceUK,"They are legally required to get such a report before 1 April 2021 so I would try and convince the landlord to delay such a report until next year. 

However it is a defence to show that a landlord has taken all reasonable steps to comply: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electrical-safety-standards-in-the-private-rented-sector-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/guide-for-landlords-electrical-safety-standards-in-the-private-rented-sector

> **What if a tenant won’t let me in, or I can’t find an inspector?**

> A landlord is not in breach of their duty to comply with a remedial notice, if the landlord can show they have taken all reasonable steps to comply.

> A landlord could show reasonable steps by keeping copies of all communications they have had with their tenants and with electricians as they tried to arrange the work, including any replies they have had. Landlords may also want to provide other evidence they have that the installation is in a good condition while they attempt to arrange works. This could include the servicing record and previous safety reports.

So in short you are well within your rights to refuse them entry."
LegalAdviceUK,"As far as I know, you can only carry forward so much holiday from the previous year if you were unable to take it. The 18 months is in relation to holiday carried forward in the event of illness.

From my own notes on a family member's tribunal case (where they were not paying holiday and just made any time off unpaid leave)

""In terms of holiday pay, where an employee is refused holiday pay, such holiday can be carried over into the next holiday period (up to four weeks)  based on Max-Planck-Gesellschaft v Shimizu; and Kreuziger v Land Berlin""

As a note, IANAL, so I could be wrong so take a look at the cases yourself."

You could also for a copy of all of these quotes to look through all the differences. They will be required to provide this under the General Data Protection Regulations.

Iteration110Cradle,I still think it is an exclusion based on bloodline as opposed to a ward key as such. So Eithan being a bloodline descendant has such immunity. If this theory holds true it will may be provable by Jai Chen who has absorbed some of that bloodline ability; maybe she can reach into gold without being suppressed that we can see when the books visit the side characters.
LegalAdviceUK,"So from my understanding of what you have said:

Usually you need to apply a Stop Loss manually after buying a stock through the HL platform. It isn't an automated process.

You decided to continue holding the stock aware the Stop Loss was not applied and then unfortunately the value of the stock went down.

You are now seeking compensation?"
Iteration110Cradle,I think Soph would have completely overwhelmed her with power that there would be too much to control before she was obliterated. I assume Lindon would have done something similar just more focused as this was little blue contract.
Iteration110Cradle,Recently finished my second read through of Wintersteel and listening to the amazing TB on audiobook and I still want more. I have never reread a book back to back and never read through a series as frequently as Cradle.
LegalAdviceUK,"Occupational hazard (I usually oversee our team responding to complaints/FOS); look at all the facts before making a judgement.

I agree with you, just trying to see why the OP feels there is a case and if anything through the process could have led them to believe such a thing was in place."
LegalAdviceUK,"The potential award may not be significant and be smaller than the cost of the legal costs and claim.

Was this invoicable work for them or were you seeking it on a no win no fee basis?"
LegalAdviceUK,"If the option was greyed out what did you do about it? Why keep the money invested  if you couldn't put the stop loss in place?

Are stop losses automated on other stocks for example which would lead you to believe it would then be automatically applied here?

Trying to understand the process and controls here to provide an independent view."
LegalAdviceUK,"Which terms are you looking at? The ones I can find don't seem to include stop losses only limit breaks in the exclusion.

There is much more of the process I would need to get my head around to see if there is any merit in the complaint, but I think the terms could be argued as unclear so not relied upon to refuse a complaint, if they are the same ones I can find (from my professional opinion)."
LegalAdviceUK,Next time report the comment rather than respond with insults of your own.
LegalAdviceUK,Your comment has been removed for being not helpful or legal. Don't comment if all you want to do is trash the OP
LegalAdviceUK,"Were these individual stocks or mutual funds of some sort? 

Do you have stop losses on other stocks and if so how were these applied?

Have you had the Ombudsman decision? It is the second stage you will usually have an investigator respond first with a decision which you can agree or disagree with?

If that fails you could go to court but you are looking at £700 for a £10k claim (I believe) and there is no reason they will find differently than the Ombudsman."
LegalAdviceUK,"If the median award is £18k, this seems reasonable to ask for at this stage. When I went through a case with my sister I explained within my request (without prejudice) that this is the amount we will be happy to settle with at this stage however should this proceed to a tribunal you will be pursuing the maxmium award possible which may be significantly higher.

They will probably low ball you, you could then counter with again something above your minimum such as £12k + loss before hopefully settling at the top of your range.

Should say IANAL"

LegalAdviceUK,"The receipt does not matter at all.

You should be able to change the legal bit into first person and send to them. head it ""Letter before action"" give them 14 days to refund or you can actually take them to small claims and report through to citizens advice who handle the consumer complaints for trading standards."
LegalAdviceUK,"I assume you have only very recently purchased the item?

You are entitled to a full refund under your right to a short term right to reject as outlined in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Legally speaking:

The goods are not of a satisfactory quality and fit for the purpose in which they were purchased as required by S9 and S10 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015. A second hand laptop should still have a reasonable battery life when purchased.

Due to this you are using your short term right to reject provided b Section 22 of the act which allows you to treat the contact at an end and you are entitled to receive back the same amount of money (Section 20(10)) without undue delay.

If they fail to refund you then you will have to begin a claim through the small claims court and report them to trading standards."
LegalAdviceUK,"You could technically sue them in small claims for the cost of the food? Do you have evidence it is them?

If you wanted to go down this route (and I am not sure of the optics but stealing food is pretty shitty too), write a letter before action first asking them to pay for what they have basically eaten. If they don't pay then you will take them to court and the costs will be added to the claim."
LegalAdviceUK,"Is it a financial payout you are looking for or something else? If the former are you trying to work out a figure?

It really is going to depend on the severity of the case.

Is this based on a dismissal or constructive dismissal?"
LegalAdviceUK,"Where a block is in place it should mean that future transactions are not authorised so there should not be a way for transactions to come back on themselves.

The exception to this is if the merchant re-attempts those transactions, which they could technically do, those transactions will be authorized by your bank.

There isn't a status of a card transaction where it can just sit on an account blocked which is then suddenly released.

There are different ways to implement a block and it really depends on the bank and how they have built such a requirement. What they need to allow to happen is to stop what are called continuous payment authorities which are basically recurring transactions. They are usually marked as such when the payment is put through within the authorisation request and don't include things such as the CVC/security code (as merchants can't store this information).

A very smart system will reject just recurring payments where the CVC code is not present or the transaction is identified as recurring. However; I would expect instead for it to be a merchant block based on their merchant ID.

If they did have a smart system, you could be blocking multiple recurring transactions with the same merchant. Removing the block would allow all of those recurring transactions to continue.

I can't see how old transactions could reoccur"
LegalAdviceUK,"PayPal are charged by the card association for the chargeback which they have passed onto you.

As you know the sellers details as others have said make a legal claim against them, after sending a letter before action.

If they ignore then a small claims. Include the fee you have been charged."
LegalAdviceUK,They shouldn't backdate transactions no and doing so will likely be liable to a complaint.
LegalAdviceUK,"I would argue they could be within the six months depending on purchase date / original call.

However, Argos are saying they have investigated and assessed it as fit for purpose. If the item overall wasn't fit for purpose the reviews should reflect this.

It would seem they are now asking to be shown otherwise."
LegalAdviceUK,"A formal complaint should cover everything you need. It's not like complaining in a supermarket where they might apologies and offer you £10.

Financial complaints are regulated, must be dealt with in a specific way and you can choose to take a complaint to the ombudsman who can make a legally binding decision.

You could also choose the go to court, but they may expect you to go through the complaints process first."
LegalAdviceUK,"You will I suspect be claiming for unfair dismissal due to pregnancy/maternity related dismissal. This doesn't require a two year wait period as it's considered automatically unfair unless they can show otherwise.

They need to provide written reasons behind the dismissal.

You gave made the right move contacting a solicitor who can walk you through this."

LegalAdviceUK,"No, they can't just terminate you for being offered a position to start after yours will have ended. In fact given you have been made redundant and are serving out notice you actually have the statutory right to reasonable paid time off to look for new employment. 

With gardening leave they can of course ask you to work up until your contract ends just in case you did start working for the new employer earlier."
LegalAdviceUK,"To offer actual advice we are going to need more information.

You say there is no lawful reason, why do you suspect that is? For example a lawful reason can be that it is in legitimate interests of the controller or third-party to process the data.

An example in this case is recovery of money, it is in the interests of the controller to recover the money and use a specialist recover company to do this. Your rights to privacy do not override the rights of the controller, you can object to your use of the data in this way but it doesn't mean they have to stop."
LegalAdviceUK,They can't evict you for at least six months; plus after that period they will still need to go to court to do so. It is unlikely anyone will buy with that going on.
LegalAdviceUK,"You can refuse any viewings as a tenant. If necessary don't damage but change the locks and retain the old ones.

I am curious if such viewings are permitted as this isn't to facilitate a house move for which an exemption does apply."
LegalAdviceUK,"As you will be liable for the rent until the term comes to an end, you could always offer to subsidies the room slightly to someone else.

Unfortunately this is the reality of renting and then moving. Such costs and contracts need to be factored in. Is there no break clause at all within the agreement?"

LegalAdviceUK,"In short, no for both. If they realised later they could make a claim against you."
LegalAdviceUK,"Make a complaint to whomever deals with data protection within the company as it will be a breach of GDPR. You can technically ask for compensation if they would like.

If they don't take it seriously it can be reported to the ICO"
LegalAdviceUK,You need to inform the company that you received two otherwise they could ask for the item back in future and make a claim for the cost if you were not able to return it in the same condition in which it was delivered.
LegalAdviceUK,"Given its a middle name you are really not going to run into any problems. For something like a forename or surname change you should technically inform companies/organisations which continue to use the old name, but it really isn't a concern for a middle one.

You can inform companies if you wish, get a new passport etc but I don't see it being a rush."
LegalAdviceUK,"As a note you can find the full information on the EU website: https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/consumer-contracts-guarantees/consumer-guarantees/index_en.htm

and the UK application confirmed by the EU is here: https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/united-kingdom/index_en.htm"
LegalAdviceUK,"So the EU guarantee is not that goods must last that long but you must have the ability to bring an action against faulty goods within that time period (so a legal guarantee). The time period in England and Wales is actually 6 years, 5 in Scotland.

With EU directives, they are usually introduced though primary legislation in the UK. In this case it was the Sales of Goods Act 1998 which has for consumers mostly been replaced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

Goods have to be of a satisfactory quality, so if it were to breakdown within a time period for which a reasonable person would expect it to last you may be able to get a replacement, repair or refund. After six months the obligation is on the consumer to show that there was a fault due to a manufacturing issue (i.e it was to a poor quality etc)

Leaving the EU is not going to change those consumer rights, its already part of UK law."
LegalAdviceUK,"In short they are not as a satisfactory quality as they are not fit for the purpose for which they are usually supplied taking into account the price as outlined in S9 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.

You are therefore using your Short Term Right to Reject as per S22 of the act for a full refund."
LegalAdviceUK,"So the 5.6 weeks of annual leave INCLUDES bank holidays, so if you were automatically given bank holidays off you would have, as a full time worker, 20 additional days as holiday (8 days are then public holidays).

I would very much expect those 25 days to not include bank holidays so you actually get 33 overall.

Just check with them, they can't override those 5.6 weeks, so they can't take those additional 3 days away from you. It may just be worded poorly when they intended to give an additional 5 days the drafting has resulted in the removal of 3. 

I would go in and ask politely if they could confirm."
LegalAdviceUK,"You can do a few things

- Complain to their data protection officer (and also ask for compensation)
- Report their failure to comply to the ICO
- Seek non-material damages for their failure to comply

By asking for the information to be updated this falls under the right to rectification under Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulations.

Depending on what was said in the conversation then the right to restrict processing as data was inaccurate may also apply (Article 18).

You are entitled to non-material damages (you don't need to show a loss) under Article 82 of the GDPR which you usually will seek from the company first.

You choose to at any point report this to the Information Commissioners Office to investigate (I would probably do this anyway given their repeated failures).

If the company didn't offer compensation you could explore other avenues to seek redress such as court action, but its really a last resort imo."
LegalAdviceUK,"Sorry but this is currently falling into immigration type threads which we may not be able to help with legally, just checking with other mods"
Iteration110Cradle,"As a mod of less superior interations/subreddits, this is far too relatable. It's the ones asking for their complaint to be raised to a supervisor or something which amuse me as they think we are working in a customer support centre doing this for 8 hours a day.

Or complaining because you removed their comment but missed someone else's unreported one three threads deep.

Anyways keep up the good work, I have very much enjoyed the theories and reminiscencing here following Wintersteel ."
LegalAdviceUK,"I'm less sure on if being fired for complying with test and trace is automatically unfair, pflurks comment below (and he is far more knowledge than I) suggests this currently is not. Acas would know more."
LegalAdviceUK,"You talk about the job being safe... my advice comes from when the that job is no longer safe and the employee is no longer employed. Such action is not triggered until that point. You are then against a clock to see if other options work before your 3 months runs out.

That is in the sense that if the employee decided to be honest with test and trace. The employer could dismiss but this would be unfair and the employee could begin early reconciliation with ACAS.

Such advice is offered on the basis that they couldn't dismiss and get away with it. 

In terms of what to do before that point, for a chain HR may have been unaware of a localized decision to advice employees to not be honest. Such companies will also usually have a whistleblowing policy. If such decisions have been purposely overlooked by HR then anonymous reporting to HSE could be useful.

Such action is then still going to create a hostile work enviroment for the store in general, even if they didn't figure out who it was."
LegalAdviceUK,"As mentioned in my original post 

> they were to dismiss her

There is no reason to go down this route if other options can be explored first."
LegalAdviceUK,"Again no, the tenant can make it clear they don't agree to such 'fines' and that these will all be disputed should it be retained from the deposit without agreement."
LegalAdviceUK,"When it comes time to receive the deposit back you can dispute it through TDS; the landlord can't just hand out fines and any such term in the contract would be unfair.

She could tell the neighbour to leave her alone (with support), the letting agency really has nothing to do with it. If it becoming embarrassment then look at reporting it to the police (on a non-emergency line)"
LegalAdviceUK,"Most thing are settled well before something goes to tribunal when ACAS start the early reconciliation and the employer realises they have broken the law.

She needs to check her companies whistleblowing policy"
LegalAdviceUK,"If she has been there for more than two years and they were to dismiss her, she would very likely win a case of unfair dismissal at tribunal.

By lying she could potentially be putting others at risk (such as customers).

If it is a large chain then you may wish to report it to HR."

Iteration110Cradle,"I just don't think its Will's style; I believe he prefers to avoid romance where possible more from a writing it well perspective than anything else (much more preferring the fighting scenes).

Iteration110Cradle,I don't imagine they are very far apart - to be a sage you need to embody that Icon which I suspect will be related to your Lord revelations.
Iteration110Cradle,"I think with her power at the level of a herald that won't be the struggle, it will be her revelation to advance given her change."
Iteration110Cradle,"I don't believe little blue would count, the same as Orthas. Absorbing a remnant is for example the step to become gold.

Ruby only counted as Yerin had fed her, her life force.

I do believe it will require a peak Archlord to manifest the remnant and then fuse with it.

I also would not be surprised if a body not thrice remade in soulfire would struggle to hold the power of a monarch."
Iteration110Cradle,I wouldn't be surprised if it's Eithan who had the immunity based on his bloodline
Iteration110Cradle,"A sage is anyone in the lord stage who has manifested an icon. It is said that the past it was possible to do this before Archlord, but all other sages in the current generation have been at the Archlord level before then becoming a sage.

He will be at a significant advantage over other lords, and when he very quickly advances to Overlord I would suspect he will outclass most Archlords who have not had a similar breakthrough."

Iteration110Cradle,"it is soul smithing which has never been replicated, I would assume it needs an almost legendary soul smithing item to make the armour which links their power together"
Iteration110Cradle,"It was stated that it has been tried with two and the strain was too much.

It may be that they could do it with less than eight but I think four would be the minimum and require the soul forge."
Iteration110Cradle,"During the moment  he is open to Yerin and Lindon he says

> .. but any of the three young women I might face right now are also capable of defeating me

He also says during the fight

> There had been an instant in which she could have seized the lead in the fight instead of staying on the defensive"
Iteration110Cradle,"I am not sure if bonding with Orthos' remenant would actually meet the requirement. Bonding with one is a requirement to reach gold, it is what Lindon would have done with Orthos if he couldn't be cured.

Bonding with sacred beasts is not uncommon within the world and I think many Archlords would go through this route if that was something which was so easy.

Ruby was an option with what Yerin went through to make her a clone."
Iteration110Cradle,"There were lots of character moments I enjoyed within Wintersteel.

Charity breaking her composure to drop her Dad over random farmlands after he annoyed her.

The restrain Lindon showed when fighting enemies beneath him and which were not an actual threat.

The points sage who just needs more points.

I think most of all Ruby, how she had genuine feelings which she wanted to explore with Lindon, her compassion for the bunny despite her hunger lust. There were some ying yang moments with most characters"
Iteration110Cradle,I think he was honest when he said three competitors could have beaten him. Soph I think really would have overpowered him at Underlord; he would have lost his actual match up if she wasn't so sure of herself too.
Iteration110Cradle,"I think you are missing the most important part, he is the void sage it should be something he excels in"
Iteration110Cradle,"She got to the final two in the uncrowned tournament and lasted more than a few seconds against Soph. She advanced to Overlord, came closer to the sword icon until fusing, her madra regeneration increased, she reached the whisper stage within one of her sword abilities.

She shocked the other blood artist when she managed to survive a hit from someone as strong as crusher.

Even without her Herald breakthrough, some would consider the amount she advanced within those few months as nothing short of incredible."

Iteration110Cradle,"Did they not all fit on the 'tiny' cloud ship Eithan used to have previously? Surely there is significantly more room on their new island. Given Eithan's hut unless he really is taking over the Lindon/Yerin (is there a joint term for them yet) house, while they stay in their pocket kingdom, he has his own very nice cloud ship from Shen.

If Lindon didn't put a soulsmith area somewhere, he clearly wasn't thinking things through well enough when he got the double house."
Iteration110Cradle,I think the soul forge will be well beyond her capabilities unless she has hit the lord stage?
Iteration110Cradle,"I agree completely fair as a prize (as per my earlier comment), but if he were still a contestant it would need to be seen as something which could happen for any competitor. It may be with not suitable sage he is shown such a technique to work with a less suitable one? All hypothetical given how things turned out though."
Iteration110Cradle,"There was still a battle of wills as it's not avoidable, but it seems that Ruby had some option not to push back too hard"
Iteration110Cradle,"By the end of Wintersteel, Underlord Lindon before sage seems to be stronger than Overlord Yerin before fusing with Ruby.

Yerin struggling against Soph until she became Herald; Lindon overwhelmed her before manifesting his sage Icon as it took that moment where he won for his revelation."
Iteration110Cradle,"Sure but his help has to be considered fair; He couldn't just decide to hand out things to competitors out of turn as he has sworn to impartiality.

In fact I believe some of the residual advancements of Dross were a way to indirectly help Yerin after he gets hold of everything about the other candidates including Soph to help further his model."
Iteration110Cradle,"Is it still Truegold, Soph was 'feeding' it right?"
Iteration110Cradle,"My theory is that a body not thrice remade in soulfire would be unable to contain the presence of a Monarch. I also don't think you could fuse with a weak remnant otherwise Sages could just go that way as soon as they manifested their Icon.

Yerin is unique in that Ruby was strong enough to fuse with to advance to Herald, otherwise you need to be at peak Archlord before such advancement is possible.

It is also unlikely even Yerin before she was able to turn Ruby into a clone of herself would either have the willpower to win the battle of wills or the power in Ruby to be able to fuse."
Iteration110Cradle,same I think she has moved away from the embodiment of the sword icon with the fusing of Ruby
Iteration110Cradle,"I would imagine he knew that Lindon had a strong will, enough to be noticed with the portal  which would mean he could one day make sage. I don't think anyone expected the unusual advancement in either Yerin or Lindon before they reached Archlord."
Iteration110Cradle,Northstrider could have still helped by providing the technique as a prize for one of the rounds. He significantly helped out Yerin with the time dilation as this was within the constraints of the contest.
Iteration110Cradle,Can his sageness now eliminate any aura from coming off him now though? So he pretty much is undetectable
Iteration110Cradle,"His domination of Soph before even manifesting his Icon and elevating himself to sage, shows he could have won the tournament himself while staying underlord.

Though I don't think he would have had the same motivation as from losing."
Iteration110Cradle,"My next book after wintersteel is wintersteel, I can't remember ever doing that with a book before"
Iteration110Cradle,"Same, at no point has the thought even crossed my mind that a female character could be weaker. We literally start with one of the strongest people in the universe being female."
Iteration110Cradle,"No Monarch is going to care about his debt to Eithan, its just Monarch's are not simple to kill (Penance being the exception)"
Iteration110Cradle,"Me too, which would give him a lot of access to hunger madra"
Iteration110Cradle,"Yerin doesn't even need to fly, she can just teleport"
LegalAdviceUK,You would at this stage need to prove the car did not come with the lock nut as it is beyond 6 months. I would suspect this will be difficult unfortunately.
Iteration110Cradle,"I would imagine a body not reforged in soulfire would just crumble if there were any attempt to fuse with a remnant nor would it be strong enough to bond with. Yerin's remnant for example would not be strong enough, Ruby however was.

For sage the revelations for advancing are going to be a precursor I think; how can you manifest an icon without first knowing yourself and the reason you practice the sacred arts.

For Lindon I would not be surprised if he both is and will be the end, so his pathway to 'Archlord' will be a concept embodied by his Icon.

I also theorize there will still be some limitation on reaching Monarch requiring an Archlord body."
Iteration110Cradle,"I assume once she is remade in soulfire for the third time she is considered a standard Herald, so it will be needed. Her struggle is going to be what she sees herself as in the future for her revelation, rather than the power needed to advance."
Iteration110Cradle,"They pretty much need it as somewhere to get away alone, alone, from even I hope Eithan's bloodline ability now they have a couple of new univited guests"
Iteration110Cradle,"I think Eithan is beyond being anonymous now after his showing in the top 16. Plus his deal with Reigan. I actually think he will go the Herald route instead.

With Ziel joining there is another opportunity for another Sage as Lindon has shown you don't need to have the power of an Archlord to get there"
Iteration110Cradle,I am interested to see how Soph's sister's remnant has advanced after her care!
Iteration110Cradle,"Mercy seems to have been replaced by Ziel for the next Arc, I am interested to see what happens. 

I think Grace's death could have been more dramatic, Dross identifying no way to save her for example as Lindon tackles two other Overlords. It would have also balanced that scene out a little more; while Lindon has the ability to take out both it still comes with a cost... even add Pride into the mix, only one could be saved."
Iteration110Cradle,"It may be the body needs to be reforged in soulfire thrice to contain the presence a monarch provides. Does his remnant get access to Dross during the battle of wills?

Though from what NS had to go through, it isn't as simple as just taking on the remnant, Northstrider didn't try until he had absorbed a great amount of power"
Iteration110Cradle,Is the advancement not years in the making? Eithan had 8-10 years as an Underlord I think.
Iteration110Cradle,"Does it disappear or does the Herald basically have the ability to use the power of their remnant after forcing it to their will. Given the battle both NS and Yerin go through I think that is how I look at it.

I am curious if Yerin can fuse with her remnant as well as Ruby"
Iteration110Cradle,"on 3; it seemed to be that an Archlord has three places to go

1. They can manifest an Icon which makes them a sage; the peak power of an Archlord with more skill and abilities. The skill of the sage makes it more difficult to fuse with their remnant which is why many stay at this level.

2. They can fuse with their remnant which grants them greater power, though this then makes it harder for them to manifest an Icon. We can see that fusing with Ruby, Yerin is now further away from touching the Sword Icon,s he will need to go back to working to show the ideals of being a master of the sword.

3. Ascend, suggested as promising Archlords are given the opportunity to ascend when it could upset the balance within their faction"
Iteration110Cradle,"I can't see anything really holding him back from advancing to overlord and then Archlord/Sage.

It would seem Yerin needs a single trigger of soulfire and will be classified as a Herald (a Herald being an Archlord who has absorbed their remnant for greater power); and Lindon needs to go through this twice to be classified as what everyone now defines as a Sage (an Archlord who has manifested their Icon).

It remains to be seen which route Eithan takes first, despite his insight, he pushed through to gold by brute force so I can imagine him going the Herald route, especially given his deal."
Iteration110Cradle,"I thought she pushed herself too far or was too overloaded which meant a failure to advance could have caused more damage. She then needed to settle herself before trying again.

With Yerin there were complications to advancing which she seems to have overcome as she literally now just needs to push herself through her body being reforged again to effectively be a Herald.

Eithan pretty much has a solid foundation and just didn't trigger, while Lindon actually hasn't advanced yet, he still sits a peak Underlord but with the full manifestation of his Icon."
Iteration110Cradle,"My theory is Ozriel's remnant which he then used within his creations and is a major source of hunger madra. The Dreadgods were born of this remnant or created as part of Ozriel's experiment which may have then gone out of control with hunger.

Such power was also used for the Scythe"
Iteration110Cradle,Maybe Ozriel's remnant? Did he not originally die and was reborn? Ozriel at that stage could have then harvested his remnant and have created the dreadgods as an experiment with hunger madra before the hunger consumed them?
Iteration110Cradle,"I actually think that Eithan will become a Herald before Sage, I think he has stepped away from embodying an Icon so soon and he always seems to push through barrier with power (for example how he reached Gold)."
Iteration110Cradle,"I actually think Lindon could beat Yerin still, despite the gap. We saw how he thought at the end and was pretty much using Soph as a plaything just getting close enough to consume.

He also now has access to an Icon and Yerin has move a step away from being able to manifest hers. She has a huge amount of raw power, but with some preparation Lindon will be an OL fairly easily and can consume enough power to keep up.

He just need few hundred simulations.

That said I can't imagine a situation where either of them can now go all out unless Fury is willing to supervise and revive."
Iteration110Cradle,"I thought Northstrider went directly from Sage to Monarch. Maybe I interpreted it wrong but it seems the path on Monarch can come from either and its seems to be you need to actually hit both the insight of a Sage and strength of a Herald to advance. NS getting the strength after consuming a Herald dragon and then taking on his remnant which would generally be how to advance to Herald.

Fury went the other way having the strength and then gaining the insight."
Iteration110Cradle,"We know that he could have already ascended though. It is mentioned that the number of sages and Heralds is held balanced, so when a promising Arch Lord looks to advance they look towards ascension instead. 

There are still worthy opponents, but given Yerin just took out the one he probably cared about the most it just leaves the Dreadgods and one Monarch to go."
Iteration110Cradle,"I think my biggest interest for Sacred Valley is at some point that script circle is going to be broken, and I suspect by Lindon which will unleash the monster that lurks inside.

It seems the script can cobble that monster which would be stronger than the dreadgods so if they stay in sacred valley for more than a short time they may consider destroying it without knowing what they will potentially unleash on the world."
Iteration110Cradle,I finished and went right back to reading Lindon's last fights. I think I will be quickly rereading the whole book very shortly
LegalAdviceUK,Speak to your bank and maybe they can put through an indemnity claim for the direct debit.

LegalAdviceUK,"I believe (and I work on the financial firm side here signing off on paying out) you will need to include the figure in the total amount, but you don't need to show the bank the probate unless its requested.

One organisation requesting, doesn't prevent others from paying you."

The overall estate is well below any requirement to go through something more formal."
LegalAdviceUK,"From my understanding, while they can use a Pay in Lieu of Notice (PILON) contractual clause, the termination date should still be calculated for redundancy calculation purposes on the basis of the minimum notice period

LegalAdviceUK,"I wouldn't be surprised if it was a compromised email account, especially with a PayPal payment - indeed change password"
Scams,"I can probably claim some personal development or something from the experience :)

Due to being involved in AML its helpful to run the script through to the end which is then fed back to other firms. Also lets me highlight what they do to convince and coerce victims.

I may be have been able to do more to find the boundaries of the script and if this was type of fraud I saw against my firm I probably would have.

Overall there some satisfaction in getting a quick message back saying the account had been blocked."
LegalAdviceUK,"So a few things here

- As an investor I am not aware of Revolut going bust, they are incredibly large, still recruiting, can make a lot of runway if needed and can probably fundraise more runway if they need to.

- The technicalities. When an ATM transaction is made, it is first authorised which holds the money on your account. This is then collected the next working day when the ATM provider settles the transaction.

- Revolut as far as I am aware use Global Processing Services (GPS) as their card processor. Revolut can't edit the transaction information from the GPS side, only the records from their own side. They will hold their own records which is extremely likely going to be what they surface to the app.

- There could be a discrepancy between the two systems if a duplicate transaction has come through and that discrepancy could be been fixed when they looked into your account. Its unusual but not unheard of to do a re-query the GPS API for this type of thing. They may also hide transactions which have triggered the fraud system and have then made it visible. Overall they can't change the master records.

- Where there is an ATM discrepancy the issuer does need to instruct a chargeback to the ATM operator. This will be put through under chargeback as an ATM dispute. The operator will then be required to review the ATM log. This will show the amount of notes held before and after your transaction.

- A firm can give you access to the money they day after a chargeback is processed, however, it is more likely it will take a couple of weeks to sort out. It unfortunately isn't necessarily Revolut's fault here

In short Revolut do need to make a claim, there is nothing at all the police can do, nor will the ATM provider help you directly. If you don't feel they are doing their job correctly, you can make a complaint to them which they should formally respond to."
LegalAdviceUK,"Contact shelter as soon as possible.

Are you expecting to be evicted for any reason? When did you move in and what type of tenancy do you have?"
LegalAdviceUK,"The grace period I understand is 10 minutes, there isn't a grace period on the grace period...

As someone mentioned pepipoo may be able to help with suggestions."
LegalAdviceUK,Quite simply the retailer needs to show that the part isn't faulty as it's within 6 months. So yes you are well within your rights for a full refund unless they can do this.
LegalAdviceUK,"From what you have said you need to register with the FCA as a Crytpoassets firm for the purpose of Anti-money laundering and Counter-terrorism financing.

I would still recommend getting advice, if you have the odd question though let me know by responding in this thread."
LegalAdviceUK,"The FCA Contact Centre should be able to help you here.

Are you applying for permissions or just registering for the purpose of Anti-Money Laundering?

There will certainty be firms who can help, google is all I can suggest"
LegalAdviceUK,"Regarding addressing your MP, for Caroline you can title it as ""Mrs Lucas MP"" for formality if you really want, however it is not a necessity, especially for someone as humble as she is.

Outside of some MPs who think too much of themselves, using their first name wouldn't be an issue. Looking through correspondence to my current MP (different party), I have still referred to them as their first name.

On technicalities MP is a suffix, not a title :). They can sometimes have a posh title if they have been inducted to the privy council which allows them the style of The Right Honourable (Rt Hon).

If you can cover the points you want to get across that is fine, but an MP doesn't expect a thesis level letter, so don't worry about it. Get your concerns across.

Regarding OSCCP; its a county specific acronym; PCC is a little easier to understand. I can't attest to their process in responding to correspondence, however, all you can do is send the letter, they should I hope respond. (https://www.sussex-pcc.gov.uk/contact/)"
LegalAdviceUK,"There is no reason poorly written letters should be binned when sent to an MP. Unless they are completely incoherent or trolling, they should receive a response.

You do not need any education in law etc to write such a letter. An MP receives many letters from individuals of all education level across a wide range of subjects.

Some of the most common issues are regarding social housing for example and benefits. (I used to be a Parliamentary Secretary)

I have no idea what OSCCP is to be able to comment.

Run it through grammarly, maybe get a friend to read it if you are worried. Include your name and address to show you are a constituent which should be enough for a response."

LegalAdviceUK,"Your local authority should have a risk assessment regarding the process for Corona-virus.

Mine for example for a single individual is

- Individual with a confirmed case isolates for 10 days, rest of household for 14 days

- Advice that anyone with symptoms to get tested

- Report to Department for Education and notify of a single case

- A trained call handler will undertake as assessment and determine if any contacts in the setting also need self isolation for 14 days

- Setting should be completely cleaned

So the DFE decide on the requirements for others to self isolate."
LegalAdviceUK,I would let them worry about the specifics but yes you could mention that as a concern.
LegalAdviceUK,"Which is why I mentioned that you could raise your concerns with the local authority and HSE yourself. They are the ones with the power to investigate and do something further.

They however can't tell you that they believe it is money laundering or proceeds of crime as this would constitute a criminal offence on their part (tipping off).

LegalAdviceUK,"Goods including motor vehicles need to be of a satisfactory quality under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. In general, sold as seen is a mostly irrelevant term as a fault for which would not reasonably be revealed during an inspection of the car would entitle the the consumer to a repair.

However, the other exemption is ""which is specifically drawn to the consumer’s attention before the contract is made""

If you have clearly told the customer its a non-starter and it could breakdown at any point you can look to argue this point. My concern is that you have had a test drive and the consumer has made it known they intend to drive as opposed to buying it to fix it up the signed agreement may be deemed unfair. (So the goods would not be fit for purpose as defined under S10)

If you were to refund you can reduce the amount to take into account the mileage or you could just repair the part, if it came down to you being liable.

From what you have said, I would go back with confirmation that it was sold for parts and so the condition of the car was made clear to them when purchasing the car.

I have used justified discrimination on nationality before, it very much is yes I am discriminating against you based on a protected characteristic, however, I believe I am justified for this reason. (FATCA for reference)."
LegalAdviceUK,"Yes you can remain in the property and it will roll onto a statutory periodic tenancy beginning the day after the fixed term ended on the same terms.

They will then need to give you six months notice if they would like to evict you"
LegalAdviceUK,"Discrimination can sometimes be justified if you can show it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Ultimately it will be up to a court to decide what is proportionate, but for the protection of employees I feel would be the base of a good argument."
LegalAdviceUK,"Its not worth really going into if the fixed terms are six months (as they must give that much notice at the moment anyway).

The right to six months notice overrules that term in the contract. It must also be served correctly and as mentioned not within the first four months."
LegalAdviceUK,"They must give six months notice and you only need to leave when a court grants possession to the landlord.

They can't serve a Section 21 within the first four months either, or to evict during a fixed term unless there is a break clause in the contract."
LegalAdviceUK,I was called some very harmful names and called a Trump supporter by someone I banned in r/politics; can I sue them for libel and also get them arrested for hurting my feelings?
LegalAdviceUK,"Just to clarify a S75 claim is itself not a complaint, though a complaint can be made to the firm about the provision of their service which can include how they have handled a s75"
LegalAdviceUK,"**Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Your comment or post was felt to be made with the intention to troll other posters or disrupt the community.



[Please familiarise yourself with our subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/about/rules/) before contributing further."
LegalAdviceUK,"Yes DISP applies, which means the firm needs to provide you with a response within eight weeks or a holding response which still provides you with your right to escalate to the Financial Ombusman.

If you have any questions about DISP then happy to answer.

If you have not received a final response, all the Financial Ombusman will do is to forward the complaint onto the firm which still takes a couple of months. (I have had ones comes through where we have resolved the complaint with he consumer, but the Ombusman forwards the same complaint a few weeks after the deadline). I can't imagine getting them to look into this case until early next year."
LegalAdviceUK,"From my understanding of the question it is whether this is caught under DISP which is an FCA handbook which stipulates the rules for firms regulated by them.

DISP outlines it is the Financial Ombusman Service which deals with these types of escalations, however, it also outlines the terms for a complaint and how a firm must deal with them."
LegalAdviceUK,I haven't known the FOS to even look at cases for at least two months at the moment and then its around 8-10 months for an investigation.
LegalAdviceUK,"The word should (i.e not must), the notice period will be for any break clause and after a fixed term. Due to the effluxion of time the tenancy comes to an end when the fixed term is up, formal notice is not required to end something which has a fixed period of time anyway."
LegalAdviceUK,try /r/uklaw  which is focused on the profession as opposed to offering legal advice
LegalAdviceUK,"In short, no, such terms are usually not enforceable under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and also conflict with S5(2) of the Housing Act 1988.

There are terms that can be enforceable, a notice clause on its own is generally not."
LegalAdviceUK,"It is a civil infraction, is he not already seeking a civil remedy for money owed?"
LegalAdviceUK,"Thanks, he may be able to terminate the licence in that case, unfortunately that is beyond me. Regardless, he cannot tow the car."
LegalAdviceUK,"He legally cannot tow a car, this was banned in 2012. I assume there is no separate document for the car parking space? Is it mentioned in the tenancy agreement?

If he tows the car it is a criminal offence and he can be given a fine.

This is outlined in S54 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012"
LegalAdviceUK,"If the spouse is habitually resident in the UK then yes a divorce could be processed here, though there is no reason for it to be.

I would assume an annulment would be preferable given the circumstances.

The Forced marriage unit will be best to advise on all potential options, they have a specialist team for these types of circumstances"
LegalAdviceUK,"Regarding your spouse, she can get support from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, details can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/forced-marriage

That is likely to be the scope of any UK legal involvement. The rest will depend on either your own jurisdiction or the one in which you were married. You could potentially file for divorce for example in the UK, but it won't necessarily be the right option, legal advice in your own jurisdiction may be better to seek.

The Forced Marriage Unit will likely be aware of options available for overseas marriages."
LegalAdviceUK,You only need to do this with a break clause or after the fixed term. Otherwise the contract comes to an end unless you remain in the property after midnight on the day the fixed term ends.
LegalAdviceUK,Not at the end of a fixed term. Such requirements are usually unenforceable.
LegalAdviceUK,It will be something you could report through citizens advice who pass the information to trading standards
LegalAdviceUK,"There are plenty of them and one will be able to help.

I appreciate you are in a position where you seem to want to give up and I am sorry it did not work out with your business partner. Please do consider the serious consequences of not complying, it will be much worse than getting an accountant involved."
LegalAdviceUK,"If you are willing to pay a fine, hire an accountant instead"
LegalAdviceUK,"A landlord needs to tell you before you move in, if they may seek to recover the house so they can move back.

The other way to evict you is to serve what is called a section 21 notice (s21) which usually gives you two months notice. Due to covid19, this currently needs six months notice.

It doesn't matter than your contract is for 3 months (that is how long the fixed term is). You CANNOT be evicted unless it is approved by the court.

They cannot go to court until they have correctly given you six months notice. You can stay at the property beyond the 3 months legally should you wish to. Even if they served the notice correctly its going to be well into mid-2021 before the court has time to deal with an eviction."
LegalAdviceUK,A s21 can't be served until after month 4 anyway right?
LegalAdviceUK,Bespoke goods do not have the right to cancellation; they still need to conform to the contract. Hence why ownership of the dress is more important.
LegalAdviceUK,"and its back up, I am going to just remove this chain"
LegalAdviceUK,No need to apologise.
LegalAdviceUK,its removed until the personal information is deleted - this is mostly for your own protection to avoid individuals off the internet for knowing where you are. thanks
LegalAdviceUK,Sorry the letting manager name is still there.
LegalAdviceUK,The address in the 1st line of the letter and the property managers name please.
LegalAdviceUK,Can you remove the personal information please? Thanks
LegalAdviceUK,"Many jobs are on your feet for the full day; you do get used to it.

Just going to add to this, on the last point - you do get used to it.

When you start working in a position which requires a lot of standing, it is initially tiring with strain with on your feet and legs. Physically you are not used to such exertion. After a while, you build up the endurance and its no longer an issue.

I have certainly noticed this when I have changed job roles or worked longer hours (I went from 8 hours a day in one role to about 14  when I was a student).

You can buy insoles / shoes which help.

An employer should make a reasonable risk assessment of working environments, but as my first point many non-office jobs involve standing for extended periods of time. If there is a medical reason than make sure it is known so the employer can make adjustments."
LegalAdviceUK,"It may be worth contacting your council responsible for roads (county or unitary for example) regarding if notice has been given for the street work. If it has not, they will be in a position to investigate given it is their street."
LegalAdviceUK,"Trespass is not a criminal offence but a civil one. A strongly worded email is about what I would expect for what happened.

There isn't anything further to do."
LegalAdviceUK,"The individual will have:

- Made a false representation
- Been dishonest
- knowing that the representation was not true
- with intent to expose risk of loss to another (as the insurance would be invalid)"
LegalAdviceUK,"References should be factual, they do not need to be positive. Many companies want to avoid the risk of a defamation claim and so usually keep a reference neutral or positive.

They can however, give a bad reference if it is truthful. For example stating your were dismissed from a job or were persistently where records show this."
LegalAdviceUK,You can ask your bank to do a chargeback on the payment.
LegalAdviceUK,"Their terms can mostly be ignored as they conflict with your statutory rights. They cannot impose a term in a contract which stipulates no refunds, nor can they impose a one week time-frame.

When is she scheduled to actually take ownership of the dress and what does the contract say about payment?"
LegalAdviceUK,"So in terms of data protection, a breach would occur if the college shared the timetable information with the employer (or any other information).

There is nothing preventing someone from asking as far as I know"
LegalAdviceUK,I believe March
LegalAdviceUK,Even on a tenant ending the tenancy by providing notice? I thought there was case law on a tenant (husband possibly) not wanting the tenancy to end?
LegalAdviceUK,"The only way you be evicted is if a court orders you to leave. A section 21 is the most common way to start this process (you can't just apply for possession) and is considered a no fault eviction.

Others do exist such as a Section 8 notice, which is where there is a breach of contract, but this again during coronavirus requires 6 months notice."
LegalAdviceUK,"It can be called address fronting.

As a note, an insurer will check to see if you live at an address when you apply, its all automatic."
LegalAdviceUK,". I always bow down to Pflurk's knowledge, below."
LegalAdviceUK,"If you were all moving out, you would not need to give notice; given someone is staying, it will continue as a periodic tenancy until notice to end that periodic tenancy is served and completed."
LegalAdviceUK,"You should tell the insurer your main residential address as well as answer any questions about where the location of the car is located honestly. 

For information purposes try this: https://www.confused.com/car-insurance/guides/would-you-lie-to-get-cheaper-car-insurance"
LegalAdviceUK,It would be insurance fraud and they could find their insurance invalidated (as well as a fraud marker) which will make getting insurance later on even more expensive.
LegalAdviceUK,"It is the company which declares the individual has consented to become a director (rather than them signing a form), so it is possible to be appointed without your own knowledge.

Does anyone hold Lasting Power of Attorney for your father at all?

Companies house can remove a director if they have not consented, details here: https://companieshouse.blog.gov.uk/2016/02/17/fraud-what-we-can-and-cant-do/"
LegalAdviceUK,"It will be a periodic tenancy (monthly usually) which won't have a definitive end date unless the landlord issues a section 21 notice, after which you have six months.

No s21 and you can continue to stay (just pay rent)"
LegalAdviceUK,"They cannot withhold the deposit for you staying in a property you have all rights to remain in. Six months notice by a Section 21 notice is required at the moment, this is the statutory time limit which cannot be overridden by another term."
LegalAdviceUK,"Just show on the original inventory that it wasn't there and ask them to make sure they compare against this and not a previous document.

They cannot dock your deposit because an item was in a different room."
LegalAdviceUK,The option would be to take him to small claims for the funds after sending a formal letter before action.
LegalAdviceUK,"You will owe it back, it may be less painful to contact them about the error and arrange payment."
LegalAdviceUK,"An employer must also pay you notice outlined in the contract. Redundancy is not a replacement for a notice period.

So if you had a four week notice period and had worked for the employer two years, they provide five weeks pay (for someone under 22), six weeks pay (for someone between 22 and 40).

You can't instead just pay the one weeks redundancy (<22) and ignore the notice period.

If this has happened to a friend, they can speak to ACAS to make a claim against the employer for not paying the notice period. See details here: https://www.acas.org.uk/your-rights-during-redundancy/redundancy-notice"
LegalAdviceUK,"Is there not a notice period that the employer must give in the contract? This is usually the same as what you must provide.

With redundancy they must provide you with notice PLUS redundancy, it usually makes zero sense if the employee has resigned."
LegalAdviceUK,Thanks :)
LegalAdviceUK,Thanks - it seems those won't even come up on an enhanced check unless its deemed relevant. Also not needed to be included when providing details of unspent convictions.

LegalAdviceUK,"In general this counts as 'changing your mind' where you are not entitled to a refund for a store purchased item. (It differs online where you have the right to examine and return).

You could try and argue that they are not fit for purpose as they do not fit as per Section 10 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and are therefore using your right to a short term right to reject."
LegalAdviceUK,"If it is considered as a youth caution / warning you do not need to mention it to an employer.

If the position requires a DBS, which for most non-children based entry level jobs should not, you are fine."
LegalAdviceUK,"The banning notice is irrelevant, it has nothing to do with the police. It is a notice saying you have no permission to be on some land so they can try and pin burglary on you if you were to return with the intention to steal.

Even if you had a formal caution, which I don't even think you got this far, it is spent immediately."
LegalAdviceUK,"Even at worse, it is a spent conviction - it does not need to be reported to college or an employer.

There are very few roles which require you to share both spent and unspent convictions (such as working with the police). I can only remember seeing one during my various roles which is when I had to undergo a national security vetting."
LegalAdviceUK,"Which don't need to be complied with. A police DPA request provides a reason to share data with the police - I have been on the receipt of enough of them. 

They exclude personal data from the provisions of GDPR under Schedule 2 Part 1(2) of the Data Protection Act 2018.

A requirement to provide information is by any rule of law or by order of a court as per Schedule 2 Part 5(2) of the Data Protection Act 2018.

Excluding my throughts on revenge porn which is that it is immoral and those sharing should rightly be investigated, the legal answer is the police request is that, a request only."
