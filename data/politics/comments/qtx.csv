That is what Russia does, spread and feed false information aimed at certain groups. They have noticed how incredibly easy it is to manipulate people who want to believe certain things and went full in on that.

This isn't some multibillion operation, this is an incredibly cheap way to cause major disfunction in a foreign country without any consequences.

ukpolitics,"> The French love us ? We've definitely gone into the twilight zone back up and find the entry point.

Why do you say that? Is it because the Brits always make fun of the French and always try and make them out to be the bad guys? Or is it actually based on facts? Cause the French don't really care about England, at all.

It's the UK that has a weird obsession with France and Germany but the opposite isn't true at all. The UK is the last thing they think about. Especially pre-Brexit.

The constant war jokes and innuendos, it's like the UK is still stuck in the 50s. France, Germany, the EU all moved on decades ago yet the English keep bringing it up again. For what reason?

Answer is pretty simple but recognizing the reason behind it is hard for anyone involved to accept since it will break down that invisible wall build around them; the recognition that the only reason for the jokes is to make themselves feel better about themselves and pretend to be better than anyone else while in fact the country they live in has been an utter shitstorm for decades.

Better to blame and make fun of others than to face your own problems right."

ukpolitics,"Ever noticed how England always tries to make its neighbors to be enemies? They 'hate' the French and the Germans and claim to be their biggest rivals in everything.

England loves to think Germany are their biggest rivals in football, when the Germans biggest rivals are the Dutch. They don't even remember 1966. QI had a great clip where you could see Sean have a complete mindfuck when he heard that for the first time.

His whole life he was told that Germany hates England as much as they do them when in reality they don't care about England at all. Not in the slightest.

Same with the French. They couldn't care less about England. Their media never makes jokes about them or tries to stir their readers up by some small thing England did.

England loves to be self-deprecating, loves to make themselves feel like the world is against them while in reality (up until Brexit) no-body-cares what they did.

Maybe that's the reason. They try and stir things just to be noticed by others."

It's not.

It was predicted at the start of this year that we would have a vaccine by the end of it. The procedure of making the vaccine was not rushed. The only thing that was rushed was the funding part and the red-tape you normally get when making a vaccine.

Normally it takes years to make a vaccine from start to finish but this is because of lack of funding and the endless bureaucracy needed to implement it.

This was the part that was rushed for obvious reasons. This is an emergency, people and governments threw cash at it and made the red tape disappear faster than normal."

photography,"It's with all art, if you add a BS story to the art-piece it will be worth more.

If two photographers make two identical images, like 100% the same, and one of them just shows the image without a backstory and the other makes up a backstory the one with the backstory will be more popular.

It's not about the art it's about the bs that the artists added to it **to sell it**.

Nothing wrong with that, everyone needs to earn, but once you realize that you will look at everything differently.

Being able to describe your art (even if it's completely made up) makes it more valuable.

Sad but true."

SubredditDrama,"A lot of parents have kids cause it's expected for them to have kids, social pressure, they will never admit that out loud but it's there in their mind, the feeling of being pressured to having kids and starting a family. So they use that build up 'anger (?)' and pressure other couples in doing the same thing just so they will feel better about themselves. Reaffirming themselves that they did maybe do the right thing having kids and succumbing to social pressure.

Again, they will never say it out loud but a lot of them hate that single person or that childless couple cause they see them having the freedom they have longed for for so long. And the only way for them to feel better about themselves is to try and make that other couple be stuck in that 'hell' with them.

Hey, don't get me wrong, having kids can be fun, it's just not for everyone. Especially with the complete doom hanging over us with climate change."

Double hung windows are typical to American homes but nowhere else.

> While double-hung windows are standard in the US, turn-tilt windows, which can be 10-30 times more air-tight, are standard in Europe. Instead of sliding upwards to open, these windows either swing inward or outward from its vertical hinge, or tilt inward or outward on its horizontal hinge.

This is how it's always been done. This isn't something new.

The media called Trumps election, Bushs election, Reagans election, but suddenly now you don't trust it? Not once has the 'media call' been *overruled* by the electorate meeting in December.  This is simple math, you count the electorates, if it gets over 270 you have a winner. You don't need to wait until the electorate says it outloud. We all know how to count.

The right have set up donation funds and what not to make sure that every bit of fake news they can release is easily accessible and readable for everyone. No paywalls, free for everyone to read.

Whereas every bit of actual journalism that will proof those articles to be lies are behind paywalls.

What use are all these high quality journalistic articles if it can't be read quickly by everyone?

Why hasn't 'the left' made it easier to share vital articles like their counterparts on 'the right' have done?

> Hi, a female friend of mine has been approached (by email and whatsapp) by an individual in possession of a group of photos of a pornographic nature, that she took approx 12 years ago. 

Surely she would know who took those pictures?

> The blackmailer has the photos as he sent her a large sample of the documents in question.

How does this person know who she is?"

unitedkingdom,"The problem you have is that your whole life is based on in which class you belong too.
