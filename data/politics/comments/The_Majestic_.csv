newzealand,Not center enough for the country and not right wing enough to keep there base in line.
newzealand,So Crusher gone Monday?
newzealand,The salt if Labour govern alone and Greens get there five percent.
newzealand,Some morning house work then some afternoon gaming I think might play some tabletop simulator with some mates.
newzealand,God speed mods.
newzealand,Like a knife in the back.
newzealand,They only care about the budget when the left is in power.
newzealand,Here Winston here is an actual blank check just no wealth tax.
newzealand,They told me people love Judith it's just Reddit and the media.
newzealand,Needing the greens or not is a knifes edge of sorts.
newzealand,Labour alone or with the Greens bye bye Judith.
newzealand,Which would be the same thing as last nights two polls said.
newzealand,The same as the last two polls the margin of error.
newzealand,The last few days have but the build has felt like an eternity.
newzealand,Thats a reddit thing nothing r/NZ has any control over and crying about down votes will just get you more down votes.
newzealand,Is Collins going to be hanging around after they roll her on Monday?
politics,I thought that was Hilary who was getting locked up any day now?
newzealand,Don't worry the government will step in to make sure the bubble doesn't pop.
newzealand,I will not quit said person who is getting fired.
newzealand,Ill also be wasted but not at a club.
worldnews,On the current polls its looking like a 20 point land slide for her and the election is over on Saturday thank god.
newzealand,That sound in the back round you can hear its the National Caucus sharpening its knifes for Judith on Monday.
newzealand,pretty much
newzealand,Well this will change no minds.
newzealand,Taking Judith at her word thats a good one.
newzealand,Shes gone on Monday and knows it.
newzealand,Judith needs to learn when its not her turn to shut up.
newzealand,Judith is going to be fucking pissed all week gunning for the Greens and the wealth tax and they go up a few points.
newzealand,Such an own goal but that sums up Nationals year.
newzealand,Bye Bye Judith.
newzealand,"Labour – 47.5%

National – 28.5%

Greens – 9.5%

ACT – 7%

NZF – 2.5%

TOP - 1.5%

Maori - 0.5%


Not One News soon"
newzealand,Watch them not care about the debt when its National in power.
worldnews,I wouldnt trust her but John Key and Bill English would have listened to the scientists.
newzealand,"She won't quit she'd be rolled. 

But imagine before Covid if a National leader had said yeah I am doing great on 32 Percent."
worldnews,Nah our elections on Saturday we need her to win in a landslide.
newzealand,Don't disrespect Tasmania!
newzealand,They let Judith be Judith and its gone over with a thud.
newzealand,Judith you won't be missed.
newzealand,Its going to be close ether way.
newzealand,"Every time Judith opens her mouth she puts her foot in it. 

Her argument seems to be vote for National cause it's her turn and people have always voted for National what else are you going to do vote for the hippies and commies?

The arrogance and entitlement really puts people of so I wouldn't be shocked if she gets under 30 on the day but National getting around 32 is probably a safe bet."
newzealand,"Given how Judith's Ponsonby walk about went avoiding malls for her is probably a good idea. 

People who get paid minimum wage or just above arent Nationals voting block."
newzealand,I wouldnt put money on that.
newzealand,"If National actually wanted to earn some votes with a traditional war on fat they had an easy way to do it Judith goes yes I am fat NZ is also fat per capita. 

Gerry goes yes I have been fat my entire life. 

They then go Covid hits fat people really hard as Borris Johnson found out this the hard way is how the National party plan to help things.

But going fuck fat people thats their own problem 3 days out before the election helps no one and changes no votes."
newzealand,"A Labour only government with the Greens at 6.

Labour would have a path to a third term."
newzealand,"Him 

DR Shane Reti 

Christopher Luxon

Simon Bridges again."
newzealand,Smart money would be Newshub doing one Friday its been a bit since they have done one.
newzealand,The last as the same three polls the margin of error.
newzealand,"I half expect her to do it on the closing statement of the last debate. 

Vote me you fucks it's my turn to be PM I am owed this ,  what else are you going to do vote for the fucking Hippies and Communists?"
newzealand,Imagine if the scripts were flipped and said Jacinda had been the one who said being over weight was a weakness Judith would not stop screeching about it being an attack on her.
newzealand,Take a shot every time Judith says wealth tax.
newzealand,"Why haven't you shown your cacaus your internal polls?

They show the same thing you lossing badly."
newzealand,Fat people hate fat people the most.
newzealand,Of all the things National could have been focusing on in the last few days of the election I did not think it be a war on fat.
newzealand,A couple bottles of wine I'd bet.
newzealand,Depression and addiction aren't choices we make.
newzealand,Lizard person.
newzealand,"National are not a government in wating but a party that's ripping its self apart.

Just over 3 days and it will be all over."
newzealand,Been a while since we have had a Newshub-Reid Research poll hopefully get one before the last leaders debate.
newzealand,Which she spent most of last month attacking.
newzealand,The pundits will say she won that one to.
newzealand,Worst of both worlds for National Labour would have a path to a third term as well.
newzealand,Shes getting under 30 percent on election night at this rate and getting rolled on Monday so she is just lashing out it's sad.
newzealand,Imagine if Greens got 6 and Labour got 50 the salt would be epic.
newzealand,Ouch I only just got over a Sinus infection bugger dealing with a lung infection on top of that get well soon mate.
newzealand,Looking at the fuckery that goes on in the US no thanks I'm happy to wait paper ballots all the way.
newzealand,Its going to be a short election night.
worldnews,And so far is looking like it might be a myth to get herd immunity from this virus as more and more reports trickle out of people getting re infected 4 months later.
newzealand,Who would have thought lower interest rates = more borrowing = higher house prices.
newzealand,Watch the party of personal responsibility and small government  all vote no if the Cannabis Control act comes up for a vote.
newzealand,Karma is a bitch.
newzealand,They took that away last census didn't they?
newzealand,"Got to love how the conversation has shifted from will Labour be a one term government to will they govern alone.

If it was just a rally round the flag affect that would have faded buy now Nationals implosion has kept the center with Labour."
newzealand,And pay for it them selfs.
newzealand,The only thing stopping Labour governing alone right now is the margin of error going buy the most recent polling the more she attacks this wealth tax the more people will jump ship from National to Labour to get them over the line and govern alone.
newzealand,I like Dr Shane Reti but I doubt he can navigate the loins den.
newzealand,I mean it's been more or less election season since coming out of the first lock down.
newzealand,I mean the only numbers I pay attention now to are people in the hospital and how close are we to 28 days without community transmission.
newzealand,"Every attack against Labour has failed to make a dent in the parties popularity so might as well try and punch down to the Greens. 

I do think it will back fire though as more of her core base jump ship and vote Labour to make sure they get over the line and govern alone on the day."
newzealand,She won't be the only one drinking election night party!
newzealand,"Judith Collins is just sounding more and more desperate as we get closer and closer to the election day.

When its looking like there will be multiple National MPs wanting her job after the election and are ready to roll her I can't say I blame her."
newzealand,Muller 2.0
newzealand,The knifes are out and at the ready.
worldnews,You do get a vaccine for the flu.
newzealand,Start drinking early.
newzealand,People in my neck of the woods just want this election season over and have known how they are going to vote for months.
newzealand,Start counting at 9am on the day
newzealand,It won't take us long to know the results on Saturday night and the polls this week will give us the best idea of the government will look like.
newzealand,Well a little hungover but not to bad nothing some eggs and a powerade won't fix.
worldnews,A fith of the population 1 million people live in the city where the second wave happend but yes tell me more how we all live in the country.
newzealand,That John Key fella I would have a beer with him.
newzealand,My family men going for ACT women Labour all life long National voters so it will be interesting to see how that plays out on the day nation wide.
newzealand,Well booked in for lunch at 130 at boneface then playing some board games afterwards so should be a pretty good Saturday.
worldnews,It's funny how the article doesn't mention America at all but so many Americans seem to see this an attack against them.
newzealand,"Judith Colin's and Gerry Brownle the only ones who have seen the internal polling the last month id bet.

If it was anything even remotely good shed share it to calm the party."
newzealand,The time trials gods I hate them so much.
newzealand,She wanted to start drinking early on a Friday?
newzealand,"Is Judith just using these winery policy's as an excuse to start drinking early on a Friday?

But sounds like how we end up like Melbourne."
newzealand,Yes.
newzealand,Chur
newzealand,I'd put good money on her never hitting 35 percent even on there internal polls.
newzealand,How much is that out of total voters?
newzealand,"Her caucus really doesn't seem happy and bridges floor was what 26 Percent?

They aren't doing much better now just depends on who gets voted out and who stays."
newzealand,"So who's going to be leader after Judith?

Dr Shane Reti

Simon Bridges again?"
worldnews,"Yup I voted Greens so do want them in there. 

National needs to kick the dregs out of the party and spend the next 3 years re building if they want a chance in 2023 take some time to build up a fresh face and with a smaller caucus should be easier to keep it under control."
newzealand,National are actually throwing this election aren't they
worldnews,"All over in just over 8 days and most people will be voting before election day so I really don't see to much changing.

I do think Adern and Labour will govern alone on the day though the chatter I'm hearing from a lot of traditional National supporters is they really don't want The Greens in government so they are voting Labour to keep them out."
newzealand,"Its not the party of John Key and Bill English anymore.

Hopefully they use the next 3 years to rebuild and let the adults run the party not the inmates."
newzealand,My internal polling is great you just cant see it.
newzealand,P is for Projection.
newzealand,Well derp.
newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/j772c0/1_news_colmar_brunton_poll_with_time_running_out/
newzealand,The only movement we  are seeing week to week is literally the margin of error not great for National.
newzealand,He might want to ask Peter Dunne.
newzealand,"If Judith never gets above 35 Id be so happy. 

Edit: and I'd add to that the only movement we are seeing week to week is literally the margin of error not a great place for National."
newzealand,Voted first thing Saturday morning my mates and family all will have voted before the end of this week if not already.
politics,We can only hope that they reject overwhelmingly so the courts cant steal it.
politics,Well when its looking like America might become a fascist oligarchy openly yeah the Overton is pretty right.
politics,Oh My!
newzealand,Having a beer going to cook some frozen pizza for tea pretty good Thursday.
newzealand,Only the best running for the New Cons.
newzealand,Trump getting a Nobel prize would be a fitting end to 2020.
newzealand,Id be so happy if National never hit 35 under Judith Collins her own target for quitting as leader.
newzealand,On Newshubs poll they did a break down 40 Percent were going Labour 40 ACT and 20 National
newzealand,NZ First won't be missed.
newzealand,Borders are closed and will be to at least 2022 going buy the treasury report.
newzealand,"At this stage I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually happening. 

It's going to be real interesting to see what the One News poll says tonight. The moves the National party are making are not one who is going to successfully make Labour a one term government but who seem terrified they are going to lose even more of there party to ACT and some fringe right wing parties."
newzealand,If that church had followed the rules we could have wrapped this up so much faster.
worldnews,I'm just above sea level here even in winter it never snows.
newzealand,The leaders debates taking place after most of us have voted seems really stupid.
newzealand,My predilection ill need beers.
newzealand,Not so much a fight as one party clinging on for dear life.
newzealand,Better for everyone involved.
newzealand,Whoever did the M&Ms masterful trolling.
newzealand,U block Origin is great but when I'm mobile it's all National adds.
worldnews,For me its when the lawns start getting cut regularly and the smell of fresh cut grass makes me think it's almost Christmas time.
newzealand,Greens are looking pretty safe.
newzealand,I always get the National adds.
worldnews,The white house has more cases than we do.
worldnews,Hopefully twice is enough for us.
worldnews,Diddnt you guys do it twice to?
worldnews,BBQ at Christmas time is the best sit outside drinking with the family.
newzealand,Own its own in a vacuum this would be nothing to worry about for her but it just adds to the story of National more concerned with their own parties internal politics than actually running the country.
newzealand,This is good news last minute surge when people are actually voting.
worldnews,We are totally a hellhole.
newzealand,And almost at full incubation to cycle go us.
newzealand,Him or Bridges again lol.
newzealand,She won't go quietly into the good night its kicking and screaming.
newzealand,Not a Prime Minster in waiting but someone who knows they are about to lose badly potentially up to 20 MP's.
newzealand,{x} For doubt.
newzealand,They seem to see any form of regulation as an attack.
newzealand,The crowd clearly rattled her early in the debate and she never really recovered from there.
newzealand,"I doubt the debates will have any meaningful effect on the election.

Most people I know are voting this week or already have voted so Nationald run out of time to get anything done."
newzealand,"They have been consistently looking for someone to be there savior against ""The evil Commie Jacinda"" In the process all they have done is shown how incompetent and petty they are to the majority of the country so will more than likely spend the next three years in opposition."
newzealand,Most of the Caucus probably has her on speed dial.
newzealand,They did the same thing before Muller rolled bridges.
newzealand,No shit but looking like she will get rolled shortly after losing.
newzealand,Probably why we diddnt get a One News poll.
newzealand,"I mean hes chipping away at the National party base and the best advertisement Labour could hope for. 

They really fucked up putting him in charge of the Covid response not someone like Amy Adams or Dr Shane Reti."
newzealand,I get the feeling shes seen some really bad internal polling and its spooked her.
newzealand,Manners for thee not for me Judith Collins
newzealand,Speaking  louder and faster does not make you more intelligent.
newzealand,No
newzealand,Yeah the only change we saw last week was within the margin of error
newzealand,"You always resort to the insults its sad.

Most of the  people I know in real life have voted for National there entire life's and are looking at this lot and are jumping ship to Labour or ACT so if National is losing its die hards they are  in for a bad time.

Edit Nice edit"
newzealand,If she gets 30 32 percent she won't be. It depends on how long the Luxon crew wait to make there move.
newzealand,I get the feeling she wont be leader for to much longer after the election.
newzealand,Or National consistently under 30
newzealand,There not advertising it at all odd.
newzealand,Well booked in some mates at boneface on Saturday its suppose to be fine so as long as the wind buggers off will be a pretty good afternoon.
newzealand,Its normally the National internal polling he leaks but going buy that TVNZ story today Judith hasn't had a caucus meeting in weeks about the polling so it's probably bad.
newzealand,I mean its just been a revolving door of disasters.
newzealand,Not her I reckon Mike Hosking will have a meltdown at a Labour Greens government.
newzealand,More infighting exactly what National needs right now.
newzealand,There fine with her taking the loss.
newzealand,Did she get out the whip?
newzealand,"If you know how the other half live and give a fuck then yeah you vote Labour. 

Everyone should spend 6 months on the benefit and minimum wage to see what its actually like to live on it."
newzealand,Which is why Judith wanted the election delayed to next year.
newzealand,"There is a One News poll tonight well tell us the real story so far the only movement has been within the margin of error which is in reality not a momentum shift at all. 

The media is trying to hype up National which is going over with a thud which seems to be why they have switched to ACT."
newzealand,Id say thatd never happen but if she goes scorched earth when they try to roll her for Luxon it might.
newzealand,"Flinging shit at the wall to see if anything sticks.

It'll be real interesting to see what this weeks poling looks like."
worldnews,Aside from the one delay we have already had from all the right wing parties going do this or else.
worldnews,She delayed it once she'd do it again.
worldnews,"Our government paid 80 percent of wages in lock down which is what got us through it.

The other thing that most kiwis seem to accepted is we are in for hard times with tourism shitting the bed for the foreseeable future but so is everyone else the difference is we don't have covid so we will bounce back quicker."
worldnews,We are totally a hell hole.
newzealand,National the peasants will get scraps and like it. And if we get the chance bye bye scraps.
newzealand,Shes proud of her religious up bringing was the only thing she added to that.
newzealand,Cause more tax breaks are what speculators and landlords need.
newzealand,She's agnostic
