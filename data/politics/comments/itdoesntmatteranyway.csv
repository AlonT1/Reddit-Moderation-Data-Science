He hummed along to music only he could hear whilst waving his small fingers in the air, as he conducted his own virtual orchestra in his head.  Suddenly, the televisions playing Fox news overhead changed to a breaking news alert.  President Trump's smile covered his face from ear to ear.

politics,"There's some interesting thoughts in here - things I hadn't considered before - that I'd like to talk about, with an open mind and respect.  

Politics is a disaster in the United States (one could comment that the entire state of the US is a disaster).  The system is truly broken, poisoned at the very root. Control, power, money, greed. Corporate influence. Prisons and healthcare for profit.  Militarisation of law enforcement. Racial inequality and tensions.  The destruction of the environment for profit.  An entire subreddit devoted to public freakouts - people are on edge. Is Biden going to be the one to change any of that?  There's no way.  No set of good intentions by any political party is going to fix that. There are glimmers of hope in the Democratic party, but they're often quickly painted as radicals. Bernie will be looked at kindly by history, I hope - for being the short, angry, fucking delightfully passionate man that he is - with a message that truly resonated with people.  Bernie and those inspired by him have shifted the entire discussion further toward the left, only to be amplified by the current state of political affairs. 

In four years, we've actively solidified the insurrection of news decrying, science denying, lockdown defying people that have seem to have lost their humanity, ability to reason, civility, and sense of community.  As an American who left the country one year ago next week, I've had a lot of time to reflect...and to be honest, it's hard to watch. 32% of US households missed their July housing payments.  COVID is out of control.  BLM protests faithfully continue, with no real or only incremental change.  Biggest GDP contraction in history.  Healthcare companies who have been *publicly funded* to make vaccines will sell vaccines at enormous profit.  The worst people possible for defending the law, the environment, our foreign relations, our regulations, our educational system... are the ones doing those jobs. We are witnessing, right now, the modern day fall of Rome.  I cannot imagine what four more years would look like.

I'll say it - I'm no Biden fan. He's been moved more left by the market forces of politics, and for that I'm extremely happy.  But who I think he is, at his core, is status quo. And as you mention, there may be some temporary restoration in there - until the next crisis. 

...so with that wall of text, I'm going to make my point, respectfully:  where's the bottom?  What would it take for people to get uncomfortable enough that real change occurs? Isn't that process starting already?"

* If you're in high tech, medicine, or even construction, the world is basically yours - many places have these jobs in critical skills lists.  Check out where you want to go and find their requirements.
* Education - as another poster commented.
* Digital nomad visas for people who work from home and have verified income from another location (Spain)
* Citizenship via investment for those who have a bit saved up (and in some cases, much more than a bit!)
* Family lineage (if your parents were a citizen, or even grandparents in some cases). 

There are a lot of caveats with many visas, though.  Right now, some countries have their borders shut to Americans.  You won't be getting through (for instance, I can't leave the country I'm in right now - because of COVID border restrictions, they won't let me back in since I'm not a permanent resident).  Age and health are two things that many countries are very picky about, as well.

pelletgrills,"Hi fren!

225f should be your smoking temp. Drop that baby in when she’s nice and hot, get some beers, and be prepared to wait. 

Be careful where you drop that probe. I’ve had a brisket with a point the size of a shark fin, and if you’re using that for your temp guide, you will have jerky dry flat when you’re done. 

When your bark develops - somewhere around 170 or 180, which will be about 6 or even 8 hours - pull it and wrap it. Don’t go by temp, go by looks. Otherwise, you’ll have a steamed piece of meat with no character or crust! Wrap that baby tightly with some good Alu foil or paper, and slap it back in. 

Somewhere around 201-205, your brisket will start to jiggle when you shake it. That’s when you pull it. 

I put my brisket on a cookie sheet just in case the foil leaks (hope it doesn’t, you want those juices to absorb! Drop it into cooler full of towels, and let it rest for two hours. Don’t skimp on the rest. 

Pull and slice. Hopefully you do that steer justice tomorrow. Good luck. Let us know how it goes."
pelletgrills,I usually pull mine between 200-205 and wrap it for about two hours in a cooler. Four hours seems kinda long - you don’t want your meat to dip below 160f

VOIP,"With Avaya, you’re still looking at a lot of on Prem technology. Traditional route switch would be a better path, in my opinion - going from a CCNA to a CCNP - so you could better collaborate with the networking teams as you’re troubleshooting issues. Firewalls are also the bane of any VoIP engineer, so understanding those, their logs, log aggregation software like Splunk - then we are talking! I’m not currently versed in any of Avaya’s cloud solutions, but even then, if it’s running in AWS, you still have on-Prem requirements and networking, but maybe direct connect?


However! If you’re interested in pivoting your career from Avaya to a cloud solution such as Amazon Connect, AWS Contact Center as a service, you could leverage your many years of contact center operations knowledge and the -why- things are done a certain way and bring that into AWS with a certification. A Solutions Architect Associate would give you a lot of the building blocks, not specifically Amazon Connect though, but some of the services and design tenants surrounding it - then you pick up a language like Python or NodeJS, learn how to use Lex, and you’d have the skills you’d need to be a Amazon Connect badass.

In our society, radical expression could be synonymous with honest expression.

No one can tell you how to radically express yourself. Do you know who who you are? Who do you want to be? Here’s a chance to do so. Be the person you want to be but are afraid to because of your family, your friends, your job, society, or you’re scared of what people may think of you. Identify what it is holding you back, stare it in the face, and tell it to fuck itself. Be uncomfortable. Cry. Be miserable. Want to go home. Walk around with your dick in a watermelon. Scream at the Universe in deep playa. Question yourself, your life, your job, your relationships, the little loop you run every day. Tear it all fucking down.  

...then take some time to sort through the mess, what’s real and isn’t. Don’t make any big decisions. Find people to talk to about it. Process.  Get to know yourself. And love it. Or hate it, and change. It’s up to you. 

Then, express yourself honestly, openly, and fully.    And don’t let that stop on the road back to Reno."
politics,"...we do.  In fact, it's more expensive (for the citizenship by Visa route):

politics,"I hear over and over from some folks that if I don't like living in the US I should GTFO - but honestly, it's *not* an easy or cheap thing to do.  

You can buy visas (""golden visa"") in some countries (Greece and Spain) but they're extremely expensive - to the tune of between 250k-500k EUR.  If you don't have that kind of money to invest, Europe is pretty much off the table.  Even that kind of investment in property stipulates you can't do it with a loan - you have to pay completely.

Spain has a non-lucrative visa - if you have decent income from another source (working remotely, for instance) you can live up to five years (but cannot work!).  After a period of time, you can apply for residency and citizenship (five or 10 years, check google for most recent info).

Thailand is a pretty obtainable one - and is much more reasonably priced.  They have good English in Bangkok, Chang Mai, and in touristy islands like Koh Samui.

Beatmatch,"I learned at a roller rink in the late 90s. I took two records that were the same BPM, and started working them back and forth. They were almost the same song - different enough, but by the same producer, so I learned the mechanics of it. (Stay in Love and Take my Love by the Kromozone Project - Shout out to the Tampa breaks scene!) I did this every weekend after the rink closed up, and then started mixing different records in.  I eventually started DJing the slower sessions - learned to “program” a crowd - control energy levels, tell a story, and give people a good experience. 

TLDR: Learn the fundamentals. The mechanics. The music theory. Get to know your music collection. When things break. What sounds good together.  The energy levels and feelings in the music. Too many DJs miss these basics, and it leads to a bad set. "

I don't run either of your vendors but here's some general advice:

Having access to firewall logs has REALLY helped our voice team troubleshoot in our PCI environment.  All of our logs get sent to Splunk, and are quickly searchable.  I'd estimate 25% of our problems in our environment are firewall related :-/

UDP isn't stateful, so as long as the full range of ports used by your vendor are open, I don't know why it'd have an issue and drop the session.  TCP, though, is a different ball of wax, and firewalls are notorious for closing sessions/dropping packets if it's received a FIN from the other side.  I see a lot of denies for TCP No Connection in my logs.  

This may not be a firewall issue at all?  Do you allow mid call signalling?  Your PBX may be sending a reinvite to make sure the call is still active, and if that is dropped or ignored, your call will fail."

Beatmatch,"I spend two to three times the amount of time putting together my track list than it takes to mix it - I don't generally pull things randomly while mixing live (except those times where someone yells at me to keep playing!!)  (most) anyone can beatmatch, but really curating your music in sound, energy, and telling a story is the difference between a good and a great DJ. 

I line up stuff in iTunes first and order it there (I find it easier from a workflow standpoint).  Listen to the start and end of each song.  How similar are the beats? Do you have beats at the end, or does it end quietly? How will the intro of your next song fit into the previous song's ending?  How similar are the energies of the songs?  That's pretty much it from an execution standpoint, but consider the overall feel: Where are you in the lineup of the night - are you opening, or closing? Who are your listeners? Think about the mood you want to convey, the story you want to tell, and then be thoughtful about the order you put them in so that it performs as a cohesive piece of work."
VOIP,"I've done outbound dialing (for an evil collections company) using records piped into Asterisk's AMI.  Do some research about this, and figure out ways to send data to it!"
VOIP,"...and you're right, it's a bit of an simplification.  I also forgot min-se timers. :-p  There's a lot of things that can go wrong in SIP!"
VOIP,"You'll probably have to span the port from your switch level, if your switch supports it.  Some Cisco routers support a traffic export as well."
VOIP,"Sounds like a mid-call reinvite.  SIP carriers do this often to make sure the call is still there - it's basically a ping, and as long as they get an OK, your call continues - and most likely, your equipment is blocking the mid-call signalling. Or there's a mid-call codec renegotiation that you're not responding to, which causes a codec mismatch and a eventual drop.  

Pop up a wireshark, if you can, and check to see who is sending the BYE message.  See if you get a reinvite at the 15 minute mark from your carrier, and see if you respond with an OK or an SDP."

Beatmatch,"Thanks :) Being a dick gets no one anywhere, especially when prompted with an honest question.  Technology has evolved and has made our lives easier and allowed us to make our shows more interesting, and there's nothing bad in that at all."
Beatmatch,"Fuck, I guess I am the first ""back in the day"" comment.

Back in the day, all you had was your ear...and that's okay...because you'd never be perfect.  Vinyl didn't tell you the BPM, nor did you have a readout of what it was.  You had to cue, come as close as you could while your other song was playing with your tempo control, and then manually work the record with gentle nudges or sliding your finger along the bottom of the platter to slow it down while you were transitioning to get it spot on. I listen to live mixes I did at clubs in the early 2000s, and can sometimes hear where I nudged the wrong record the wrong way and had to quickly fix it.    

It's okay.  Don't fret :) I don't use the tempo sync button (but fuck if I don't love that pitch sync!), but if I know that one song is 135bpm, I move the tempo control so that it matches.  The software isn't exact all the time (95%+ though) so sometimes you may have to gently work it to get it perfect.  I also like the visual readout of the waveform, so I know which one is slipping and in which direction.

The tools have made things easier so you can do other fun stuff.  Like good set construction, artistry, and performance.  "

AskReddit,"I used to work in a call center of about 400 call center agents.  I was the IT guy.  For April Fools, I wrote the sheep virus - it was a small sheep that walked around on your desktop, you could pick it up, throw it around, and it would eat your icons (it was a commercial piece of freeware - scmpoo.exe).  I wrote a listener app that ran on all the desktops, and a control app that would allow me to launch the sheep on individual desktops, ranges of desktops, start and stop them on a timer, stagger launches, etc. One command started a sheep, another command killed all the sheep on the desktop (kill /f /im).

I okayed the plan with my GM and my IT Director - they thought it was a riot.  To really play up the impact, I started it on one particular computer illiterate supervisor's desktop who was always reporting stupid shit to me.  She called me over, amused, and said there were sheep on her desktop.  I walked over, pretended to be extremely frightened, and told her that it was a virus.  I asked her if she ever took disks home - she said she did - so I convinced her she introduced the virus to the network.  

About this time, a timer went off, and a few sheep in her pod launched.  I ran around like an idiot, ""checking stuff"" all day.   It slowly spread to other pods, supervisors, managers, etc.  I sent out emails about viruses, told folks that I was working on it, etc. At 3pm, peak for our site, I fired off sheep on everyone's desktop.  I pretended to panic, ran around for about 15 minutes as people amusingly played with the sheep.  I logged into a desktop on the main call center floor, sent out a kill command to all the sheep, and then sent an alert to all desktops that I had identified the source of the virus - and it was me.  Everyone had a good laugh about it, and for weeks, people asked me to bring the sheep back.

Call centers suck.  I had to amuse myself somehow."

VOIP,"Setting up a hunt group for each extension sounds like a management nightmare... especially if you're the one running the thing :-D That solves the ""if you know your party's extension"" line from a technical standpoint.  If you're doing ACD work, I have no idea... cuz I don't know how to queue a call in two separate Avayas at the same time. 

...and I like said, reporting will be a nightmare.  Your supervisors in CMS will have to switch which CM they're pulling reports from and may have to combine a report from each side to get the full agent performance.

I'll run this by one of my Avaya buddies.  Like I said, I'm a Cisco Contact Center Enterprise architect by day, so my Avaya has become more and more dull over time :-p

Are you 100% sold on Avaya? I just support it, I don't sell it... but Cisco has an active/active topology, one shared brain.  You could light one side on fire and the agents will reconnect to the other side.  Reporting doesn't skip a beat, and generally, the failover (from the agent standpoint) happens within 500 ms. The call is not lost.
"
VOIP,"I haven't done Avaya in awhile (I can tell you exactly how to do this in a Cisco UCCE environment!), but I believe using an ESS/LSP is the way to do that.  IIRC, that's one Avaya CM, centralized in a data center, with an ESS in a separate location for failover. There is no need for two separate Avaya CMs. 

No matter the technology:  If you leave it up to the agents to get right, you're going to have a bad time.  They're going to log into the wrong switch every so often. They're going to get confused during an outage window.  Will they continue to log into the B ACD after the failover, or do they need to sign out and go back to A?  Your reporting goes to hell because your intervals could contain agents spending 20 minutes on one ACD and 10 minutes on another, requiring a human to potentially mash those reports up to be meaningful.  Supervisors will get confused, especially if one of their agents is in the wrong ACD. WFM? My head hurts thinking about the implications."

VOIP,"I'm a long time UCCE guy, not a UCCX guy, but speaking in generalities, the best way to get data to your outsourcers is to have them on your platform.  

If this were a UCCE environment, you could hang a PG off the outsourcer ACD (Avaya, Aspect, Nortel, etc.) and then actually get the reporting, the data integration, and the CONTROL you need as a vendor manager.

How many agents are you currently running concurrently?  UCCX tops out at 400 (by spec, in practice, I'm not sure) but Packaged CCE picks up at about 250 and goes up to 1000.  At that point, you could hang phones off your CUCM cluster and route to your outsourcers like they're sitting on your network.  You could also balance calls between internal and external sites, automatically route by thresholds, etc. 

You can tell I'm a UCCE evangelist.  

For your outsourcer, what tech are they running?  In the solution you provided, I think you could probably write the details to a temporary database -- I'm not sure why you'd need to modify the ANI, though. I think you'll also need to write some kind of middleware to display the information.  When the call arrives at the outsourcer, a Finesse action could screenpop with the ANI to a webpage that /you have created/ -- something like http://your.company.website.com/pop.aspx?ani=4155551212 that will display the information.  It's not elegant, but it will work.

He always seemed clean, was willing to help out around the club, and I had given him sandwiches before -- I figured I'd give it a shot.

I parked my truck right next to the club, told my security to keep an eye on it, and let him get to it.  Somehow, he found tools, and when I came back outside to check on it, he had the door completely disassembled.  Each trip outside yielded a ton of progress, and at the end of the night, he came up to me and told me he needed to go find some silicon sealant.

I had a friend who's uncle drove a tour bus for a major band playing on the tour that year.  We all had backstage passes waiting for us, but we had to get through to this guy to get them.  There was no will call, and we definitely had no credentials.  We left Seattle that morning, but we couldn't get in touch with him while we were driving.  I started getting nervous.

We pull up to a big field where the busses were pre-staging, and there was a guard there.  I thought we'd never get through.

exjw,"As I sit around my decidedly pagan Christmas tree and celebrate the non-actual birth of someone named Jesus, I'm happy too.  

Life is good.  Cheers, OP!"
exjw,"My family has been in for their entire lives -- and I've been ""out"" for 14 years.  It was a little touch and go at first, but the worst thing my family ever did was leave the occasional timely Awake! magazines on my pillow.  I got lucky."
exjw,"If you get baptized, you can be disfellowshipped.  
If you're disfellowshipped, you will lose your family.
...and if you get baptized, don't want to lose your family, and don't actually believe? You're going to have to live a lie your entire life.

It's a trap to lock you in.

My folks started in on me at around 14, too.  Luckily, I was able to postpone it until I was able to move out of my parents house.  Once I got out of the house, I was able to fade away gracefully.

Luckily, I was never baptisted... I knew it wasn't what I wanted, so I sat back,  and plotted my escape... luckily, I did it in a way (faded) so that my family eventually got over it (quickly, even) and still love me and associate with me freely. My family kicks ass, and I love them dearly. Since I moved the eff out of town, I never have any old stuff come back to haunt me.  I still flick off every Kingdrone Hall, though.

I had been convinced that college wasn't important (because the system of things was passing away, duh!), and even though I had a full state scholarship, I didn't go.  I missed the boat on that one, which probably led to me spending more time in the IT Trenches.

After high school, I started working at a call center in my home town.  I smoked cigarettes with the IT guys, and I had a lot of informal IT background at the time, so they gave me a chance.  I worked there for two or three years doing light PC work, while always clawing after more responsibilities. I worked a ton of hours, did pretty much anything and everything I was asked, and taught myself ways to make myself more valuable to the company and to the department.  I made a lot of friends, and had a *lot* of lucky breaks... it's going to take hard work and persistance (I guess that's required whether or not you have a college degree).  Use that charm, persistance, overcoming objections, and public speaking ability that you've been trained in by the Theocratic Ministry School *gag*.  It's the only thing I credit the JDubs with.

10 years later, I architect complex systems for major F500 companies. I've worked in both pre-sales and post-sales, and am great at giving presentations!  I've had a six figure income since the age of 24.

I dated a lot of women.  I lived in a small town, and I had probably dated them all.  I had big parties, indulged in as much promiscuous sex and substance as I could get my hands on.  I went to raves, learned how to spin records, worked security at clubs, spun records at clubs, and was even featured on a rave circuit. I went absolutely nuts between 18 and 23, and had a near brush with a lot of bad things... and it was my wakeup call.  Have a good time, enjoy it, be dumb, in fact... but remember that some decisions have life-altering consequences.  Figure out who you are and what you want in life and if what you're doing will either help or hurt your chances of attaining those goals.  "
AskReddit,I bought the cake vodka as a joke because my wife hates the thought of it -- but it mixes incredibly with OJ or lemonade (lemon or orange cake) and would probably be awesome with some chocolate milk.

One Part cake vodka!  

It's called an apple pie... and it's delicious.  "
exjw,"The JDubs are so quick to give reasons as to why folks shouldn't be celebrating things, usually based on the pagan dates or meanings or symbolisms that the secular holidays have become.  Why not Thanksgiving?  I don't remember this being taboo growing up... and I don't think the pilgrims sacrificed things to the Satan while carving fertility symbols in Turkey carcasses or anything."
AdviceAnimals,You dated her before you introduced yourself to her before it was cool.
exjw,"I flick off every Kingdom Hall I drive by. :-D

I still feel a little weird singing the national anthem at sports games or saying the pledge.

I'm agnostic.  When you're taught that all other religions are wrong, and you come to accept that the religion that taught to you itself is wrong... 

I love Christmas.  I think it's frickin awesome.  It took several years to get there, and I was ""bad at it"" for a long time, but I've actually developed some of my own happy memories to associate with it and enjoy Christmas as much as normal ""worldly"" people.

Bonus:  no one tried to steal and hold Satanic rituals with my cats last night!  :-D"
exjw,You'll get there... and it will be great. 
exjw,"What I like the best about being an ex-jw?  *everything*.  

No guilt, no shame, the ability to have real friendships, real relationships, date freely, to celebrate, to love, to be included, to sleep in Saturday mornings, to not have to put my future children through the humiliation and loneliness I had to go through as a child in public school, to value women and believe in their equality, to not be afraid of the world!

I'll give them an iota of credit though -- I came out a damn good public speaker.  :-D"
exjw,"My mother burned my Magic: The Gathering cards... I had a sweet green deck, too.  She said she could feel evil coming off them.  

She also destroyed my Nintendo (with a hammer) because she said it made my little brother and I violent.  "

exjw,"I was talking to my JW great grandmother (who is 97) about the Democratic Convention.  She stayed up to see Clinton and Obama's speeches -- said she'd vote Clinton back in if she could.  After talking about how screwed up our political system is, she said ""...I think the only person who can fix things is Jehovah.""

Facepalm.  I just smiled and nodded."
exjw,"Awesome, and good for you.  This is a real way you can save people's lives... what good has any of those damn tracts done for anyone?  

It wasn't until I donated blood the first time that I knew my own blood type."
exjw,"Halloween is sold as the Devil's holiday where people mutilate animals and have seances and get blood transfusions.  Lock your doors and stay inside! I think it's the ultimate taboo.  

I went out my first EXJW Halloween as Jesus.  It was the most awesome sacrilege.  

Behind HW, my favorite holiday is Christmas... and that's because of all those years coming back to school on January 3rd with no new shoes and no Christmas presents while everyone else did."
exjw,"I'll tell you two sides of the story -- as an EXJW dating normal people, and when I was an EXJW dating a current JW.

Being an EXJW myself, I can tell you that I've been a real fun time for a few ex girlfriends.  People that don't have a strong attachment to holidays, through years of good memories of celebrating these times with their families, generally have a hard time understanding the importance of them to others.  I've had a few girlfriends get pissed off that Christmas and birthdays don't have the same importance to me as they do to them.  There's really no way to fake it.  I have truly sucked at holidays.  Only now, 15 years later, am I any good at them.

I dated a JW shortly after I had faded away.  There was a lot of pressure from her family to get me to come back to the church.  My family also used this as a tool to get me to come back -- I wouldn't.  Luckily, she was a point where she was ""weak in her faith"", so I didn't get much pressure from her.  The not having sex thing was difficult -- there were plenty of other things that usually just left me frustrated and wanting it even more.  The entire thing came to a head one night when she decided she wanted to (to which I responded, ""if you care anything about your faith, you don't want to do this"") and I actually talked her out of it.  I loved her too much and knew the church was too important to her to do that.  After that incident, she started floating back toward the church.  One night, I asked her if I wanted to marry her, if she could given her position.  She said that it would cause too many problems in the church and with her family... so we broke up. She started pioneering, and we lost contact for years.  It was hard, but it was something I had to do (unrelated to the story:  she seems to be doing well now, we talk occasionally, and I don't think she's associated with the church anymore.  Maybe she reads /r/exjw?)

Another point:  People like us, the outspoken EXJWs, get branded as apostates.  JWs are literally taught to believe that we're insidious, crafty, manipulative, divisive masters of Satan.  Trying to convince her of anything contrary to her faith could have disastrous results.  You have no idea just how brainwashed these people are.

TLDR:  JWs get wired differently than normal people.  In the end, the success of your relationship will come down to what she values more -- your relationship, or the church."

exjw,"I once got into an argument with my grandfather about this (I faded when I was 14, luckily my family still loves me and associates with me) -- I was talking about the subject and asked my grandfather why women aren't allowed to address the congregation directly and have to wear head coverings and address only each other when they're on-stage.  He answered, plainly, ""To show submission to the men.""  At that point, I had to bite my tongue and walk away as no amount of logic, reason, or humanity could have convinced him otherwise.  "
AskReddit,"Worst for me was when I was 15 -- worked at the high school football game on a Friday night and then went across the street to party with some guys I knew.  That night, I smoked a lot of pot.  A metric fuckton of pot.  After everyone else had passed out, I was still up smoking with this guy and finished another blunt.  I was a kid... didn't know better (and it was probably in the first dozen times or so I had smoked.).  I started feeling funny... my arms and legs started tingling.  I could feel my breath, and it felt like my heartbeat was pounding in my ears.  My chest was tingling at this point, and I started freaking out.  I went upstairs and woke up one of my friends and said that I was having a heart attack and needed to go to the hospital.  I remember it with crystal clarity... he said ""You're just high and freaking out.  Go downstairs and watch some porn.""    I went downstairs, went outside into the cool night, and walked around slowly in the apartment complex trying to calm myself down.  It felt like hours before I was calm enough to fall asleep without thinking I was going to die.

That's the only time a panic attack ever happened to me -- I kept smoking, just was a bit more careful of how much I smoked.  I moved out of my shitty little town to Seattle where I found some really good bud, and probably got that high (or higher).  After the one episode, though, I knew what it was and wasn't freaked out about it.  I never enjoyed getting *that stoned*, though.

It's only now as an adult that I've given it up because of my career.  I'd much rather smoke pot than drink (no calories in pot, people don't do stupid things like get in barfights while stoned), but since it's illegal, I don't.  If it was legalized tomorrow, I'd be sitting on my stoop right now smoking a J.
  
TLDR:  Have you ever freaked out.... ON WEEEED?"
