cringe,"Yeah literally anyone who is a democrat is now labeled ""far left"" and ""radical"". I know it makes for good scary soundbites but its a bit ridiculous. 

Both of these candidates are moderate candidates which is the only way Dems win in states like Georgia."
JoeRogan,I wouldn't necessarily say it was a landslide (although Trump did call his 2016 win a landslide and Biden won by more than that) but it was a decisive win. It definitely wasn't a close race like some want people to believe.
JoeRogan,I can't tell if this community will love or hate this but either way I'm here for it
AskTrumpSupporters,Would you join and ask questions? I’m totally down to answer questions
AskTrumpSupporters,He’s the one who said he was invited. So who’s the liar here?
AskTrumpSupporters,What do you think they should do? Ignore the electoral college and the voters and use martial law to keep Trump in the WH?
AskTrumpSupporters,What is fake?
AskTrumpSupporters,In what way am I gaslighting the sub?
AskTrumpSupporters,"So I just read that the WH says he was on a public tour and was not invited by the WH or the president. I’m actually willing to believe that and am considering taking down this post. 

If he was invited, why would it concern you?"
JoeRogan,Name something more important than this. I'll wait
fivethirtyeight,"Ah yes, that makes total sense haha. It’s early and I interpreted the comment as sorta saying “Nate is a sell out and these unfortunate things are to be expected because of it.”

Sorry OP if that’s not what you meant."
AskALiberal,"I don't know, will that be the recommendation from health experts? If so, then yes. 

Don't quote me on this but I think there's still an open question of whether or not someone who has been vaccinated can still pass the virus onto other people. If I can still pass it onto others after getting the vaccine, I assume it would make sense for me to continue to wear a mask."
fivethirtyeight,"I don't really know if you can call that ""selling out"". Nate and his team built this nerdy company from the ground up and singlehandedly made data journalism cool.

Selling a company and getting to run it is always the end goal plus they get funding, resources, advertising/marketing, and other perks from being a part of the ABC network."
JoeRogan,"Yeah that comment is insane and the fact that it has positive karma is troubling. You don’t even have to follow politics that closely to know that it isn’t true at all, not even a little."
JoeRogan,What even is this comment
fivethirtyeight,"Yeah absolutely, huge loss for the 538 podcast and journalism team. 

But to your point about layoffs, that's right. I was once the most junior member of a small consulting firm and one day they had to let half of our company go. All of our star employees were let go, people who were incredible consultants, but I got to keep my job because I was paid so little.

The company undoubtedly didn't want to part ways with those people but it was the only way to keep the company running and to save what jobs remained."
fivethirtyeight,"As someone who has seen layoffs like this upfront, it’s worth keeping in mind that it’s not usually as straightforward as just laying off the worst employees."
fivethirtyeight,Same. I actually had been thinking lately that there was a good chance Clare would leave 538 soon to go somewhere like the NYT
AskTrumpSupporters,"What case? Can you link me to the lower-court case which asks the court to ""reinstate Donald J. Trump as president""?"

JoeRogan,I think you lack a fundamental understanding of what 538 does
JoeRogan,Nate Silver and 538 doesn't do polls
JoeRogan,It's kinda hard to suggest that the House didn't want this to pass when they * *checks notes* * did pass it
JoeRogan,ya they are the party of personal freedom
JoeRogan,Odds that the GOP Senate passes this let alone even votes on it?
JoeRogan,"I honestly thought I liked this Matt guy but after learning that he occasionally deletes some tweets, I've completely changed my mind. It's hard to imagine a more unforgivable action."
JoeRogan,"It's when you think and talk about ideas on a deeper level, going beyond ""owning libs"" and shit like that"
JoeRogan,"I’m glad people here are somewhat enjoying this episode. I haven’t listened yet but I’ve followed Matt and Ezra Klein’s work for a little while now and although I don’t always agree with them, I think they genuinely try to think hard about our problems and have smart things to say. 

The Ezra Klein podcast is good if you like this sort of content."
JoeRogan,"I get it, it looks like I'm sucking up to her. 

My point is that I don't think anyone can in good faith suggest that she was nothing more than Bill's wife. Unlike Michelle Obama, Hillary actually held real positions of power."
JoeRogan,"Is the implication that Hillary was nothing more than the wife of Bill? 

If you want to say her policies would be bad for the US or whatever then that's totally fine, but she was a two-term Senator and Secretary of State for 4 years. She had all of the qualifications to be president.

That's over a decade serving at the highest levels of the federal government in both the legislative and executive branches. Secretary of State is the highest-ranking cabinet position in the executive branch and is 4th in line for the presidency."
cringe,"> a really good actor and this is all for entertainment purposes

Unless she's in on the joke, then this whole ""bit"" is still making a woman feel incredibly uncomfortable and unsafe. That shit doesn't get to be dismissed by saying it's just a joke."

AskTrumpSupporters,"Sure, precedent exists, but what do you think of it? Do you like it?"
news,Ok but dems do not control the senate. How do you pass lefty legislation without controlling the senate and while completely ignoring republicans?
news,"Yes I am stupid. Can you walk me through how progressive or even leftist policy gets passed through the Senate that is controlled by Republicans? 

Seriously, walk me through it step by step and tell me how it happens while ignoring Republicans."
news,"I didn't say they represented all Republicans, but they are indeed a part of the Republican party and caucus, no? 

The point is that the actions of Republicans shouldn't be used by dems to bash other dems, it makes no sense."
news,"I generally agree with the sentiment but it always boggles my mind that the left is willing to shit on itself for things the right does. Here the Republicans are acting in bad faith and beyond stupid yet somehow we have to use this as a way to attack the Democratic establishment.

People do realize that unless you have control of the executive branch and sizable control of the legislating bodies, you can't pass anything without working with the other side, right?

So we can play this feel-good game where we say we will never work with the other side but then you can't pass literally anything."

AskTrumpSupporters,"Every audit so far hasn't changed the vote counts at all, they've actually for the most part ended with Biden gaining a few votes. Can you play it out for me how these rulings would ultimately make Trump president?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"270 is constitutionally required. Are you in favor of throwing out the constitution to make Trump president?

Also can you link me to the lawsuit that is asking the Court to rule that the entire election is a contested election? I’ve only seen individual state lawsuits."
AskTrumpSupporters,"No but what exactly are those remedies? How does Trump get to 270?

Does the Supreme Court toss out enough ballots in key states to hand Trump wins in all of those states? Does the SC simply tell states to ignore the votes altogether and to award electors to Trump just because? Does the SC simply say that the electoral college vote doesn’t matter, to ignore it, and declares Trump the winner?

I keep hearing Trump supporters suggest that the SC will help Trump but nobody actually says how."
AskTrumpSupporters,Can you explain exactly how the Supreme Court would rule in such a way that would make Trump the president?
fivethirtyeight,"No, many Republicans think she's secretly a liberal. Don Jr has a huge following and appeal within the Republican base.

If any of the Trump kids are going to run and be successful it will without a doubt be Jr."
fivethirtyeight,"Yeah seriously, he's the president right now and he just ran a huge campaign, of course he's top of mind when Republicans think about who they would vote for in 2024. 

We also just spent 4 years where every prominent Republican supported him unconditionally, completely embarrassing themselves to defend everything he did or said. Those people likely did it because they themselves want to run for president one day. Do you think those people who want to run for president are going to sit on the sidelines for 4 years because Trump wants another go at it?

Donald Trump is about to spend 4 years out of politics, at least in an official capacity. He'll stay at Mar-a-Lago, tweet, and maybe try to get some reporter to show up at his driveway to listen to him rant every now and then. Peoples' attention spans are low these days, Trump could very well be old news in a couple of years."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Exactly. And he just lost as the incumbent! He lost while doing 5x as many campaign events as Biden, got to use all the powers of the presidency (put his name on stimulus checks, promised cash to seniors, etc), and was running against a very boring candidate. 

Trump has almost no chance of winning in a normal year against a more exciting candidate."

Conservative,"If there are fraudulent votes, why hasn't the Trump campaign presented evidence of it or even *alleged* fraud in a single lawsuit? As it stands right now, in all 30+ lawsuits, the Trump campaign hasn't even alleged that a single ballot was fraudulent."

JoeRogan,"""Free climbing El Capitan is tough. You know what else is tough? Not getting to do comedy at the Comedy Store for a bit."""
AskTrumpSupporters,"This would be a pretty clear example of fake news, right?"
JoeRogan,"You don't get to allege that Clinton had some dude killed and when challenged on that claim say ""well you don't have any evidence that it *didn't* happen"".

I guess I could say the official story of you not being a pedophile is based on circumstantial evidence. How can I be sure that you’re not a pedophile? I haven’t seen evidence that suggests you’re not."
JoeRogan,"Is this satire? 

Joe Rogan is a great podcaster / interviewer, he's a fairly awful comedian. Of course all comedy is subjective but to me his comedy just isn't smart or clever at all, it's like the drunk dude at the party who is trying to make people laugh by saying really over-the-top, ridiculous, and vulgar shit. 

I'd probably go as far as to say that if it weren't for the podcast or the MMA commentary, Rogan wouldn't have a comedy career at all. I think his comedy career is artificially propped up by his fame from other areas."
JoeRogan,"I'm listening to the Tom Green episode now (5 hour episode takes me a few days to get through) and I can't help but laugh every time Joe says ""back when Kanye was running for president"" in this serious tone. 

Does Joe think his run for president was serious? Does Joe not realize that his desire to run for president was likely due to a manic episode and further fueled by bad-faith actors within the Trump campaign?"
JoeRogan,"Yeah I mean I kinda see 3 sides here: 

* People who think he committed murder 
* People who think he acted in self-defense 
* People who think it's awesome that he killed people they don't like 

I was listening to Joe's most recently episode with Tom Green and Joe says that anyone who owns guns prays that they never have to use it in self defense. If you are treating the Kenosha shooter as a hero, then that just isn't true for you."
JoeRogan,"haha ok thank god I'm not the only one. When I listened to that part, I was like wait, why is that a good question? And of all the examples Tom could point to as good JRE episodes, Kanye is certainly not one."
JoeRogan,I can buy that it was self defense. I can't for the life of me understand why he's being propped up as some hero. Anyone doing that is telling on themselves.
JoeRogan,I think both sides are wrong in different ways but I think the people who are propping him up as some sort of legend or hero are objectively wrong and shitty people
Conservative,We don’t have a system where you make claims first and then you get time to go and find evidence to support it. If there is evidence of mass voter fraud then for some reason the Trump campaign hasn’t presented it yet.
Conservative,"Just to be clear, you don't get to withhold evidence until you reach the supreme court, that's just not how our system works. If the Trump campaign had evidence of voter fraud then they would have presented it in these lower court cases. As it stands right now, the Trump campaign has not presented evidence or even *alleged* voter fraud in any of their cases. 

In needs to be repeated that what you're hearing from the Trump campaign on TV and via tweets is not what they are presenting in court."
JoeRogan,"This was exactly my first thought too. I have to imagine that if so many US companies are willing to publicly fight this bill, then there's likely a lot more nuance to it than this headline seems to suggest."
Conservative,"Yes and no. Some states/counties inform you if your signature doesn't match and then you're allowed to come in with additional proof of identification to prove that the ballot is yours. This process is called ballot ""curing"". 

Regardless of state, if a ballot has a mismatched signature and it's not cured, then yes it is indeed tossed out."
pics,"Hero worship? When folks start wrapping up their entire personality and identity in their support for Biden, then we can talk. Some people are happy that he won and are now discovering some of these nice Biden moments for the first time, that’s not “hero worship”"
AskALiberal,The inauguration crowd size thing is amazing. It was how they kicked off the *very first* daily press briefing during the Trump administration. Literally the first thing the Trump admin did was try to convince the press and the public that *actually* Trump had a big crowd. It really sets the scene and will be a great opening for any tv show / movie that is made about the last 4 years.
cringe,"Geraldo? That 77 year old man who hypothesized on twitter that 14 year old Barron Trump would become a heartthrob? What's wrong with him?

>If @realDonaldTrump comes from behind & beats reclusive @JoeBiden, 14-year old #BarronTrump is going to be the heartthrob for the next generation. I hear the still growing, already very tall kid loves basketball. Maybe he & #LeBron's son #Bronny can play some pickup & make peace."
AskTrumpSupporters,So it comes down to you think Biden supporters are deplorable but Clinton was completely wrong to say the same of Trump supporters?
JoeRogan,"> had continued with Hillary the difference wouldn't be just 400.

You can assume this how? Just because? Gut feel?"
JoeRogan,How exactly did Obama destroy democracy? Trump is in court right now literally trying to get hundreds of thousands of votes thrown out in key states in order to overturn the results of an election. He is trying to convince state legislators to ignore the vote in their state and instead just hand him the win. How on earth is Obama the one destroying democracy?
JoeRogan,"I have no idea, maybe he shouldn't have. I am simply pointing out the fact that Trump has dropped more bombs than Obama but Obama is known for being a bomb dropper and Trump isn't."
JoeRogan,I'm just saying it's ironic that Obama is known as the drone striker when Trump has dropped more drone strikes and killed more civilians at this point.
JoeRogan,"Fun fact - one of the first things Trump did when he took office was remove the requirement to report on deaths from drone strikes outside official war zones (most of the middle east). [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47480207).

>President Donald Trump has revoked a policy set by his predecessor requiring US intelligence officials to publish the number of civilians killed in drone strikes outside of war zones...

>The Trump administration said the rule was ""superfluous"" and distracting.

>**During Mr Obama's eight years in office, 1,878 drone strikes were carried out, according to researchers. Since Mr Trump was elected in 2016, there have been 2,243 drone strikes.** The Republican president has also made some of the operations, the ones outside of war zones, more secretive. As a result, things have different today: under Mr Trump, there are more drone strikes - and less transparency.

Drone striking is pretty shitty whether its Obama, Trump, or anyone else. But I do think it's funny that this talking point that was huge during Obama's admin has since been forgotten."
JoeRogan,"Well you see they’ve been used for decades but now that my guy lost because he told people they were bad to use while in a pandemic, they are now not cool and we should get rid of them"
JoeRogan,"You can’t prove something isn’t true, you have to prove that something is true. This idea that we can’t rule out mass voter fraud because we don’t have evidence to disprove it is complete nonsense. 

The Trump campaign has not presented evidence of a single instance of voter fraud in the 30+ ongoing cases they have in various states. Not one. They’ve literally had to go on the record during these cases to tell judges that they actually aren’t even alleging fraud. 

So no, it’s actually not a problem."
PoliticalDiscussion,"I never suggested that Trump firing him should disqualify him, not at all. My point was simply that Biden should do his best to find the absolute best person to do this role. And I think a lot of people here want Krebs to be hired because he is ok at the job and was fired by Trump.

I’m saying ignore all of that and simply hire the best person for the job. And maybe that is Krebs! I don't know. But I hypothesize that there are better people out there and in my opinion, it would be beneficial to just start fresh if there is indeed someone better."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Yeah of course I don’t have someone in mind, I’m not a cyber security expert. But it seems a bit silly that everyone is suggesting that this one guy is the only one who can do this job well."
JoeRogan,Totally agree. Episodes like that are what make JRE great.
PoliticalDiscussion,Why wouldn’t it be a positive thing for Biden to choose someone who is equal or better than Krebs but who doesn’t have the baggage and who’s selection wouldn’t be a news story?
PoliticalDiscussion,Is the suggestion that Krebs is the absolute best person for this role? That there is literally nobody who could do the job better? I just think its a net positive for Biden to start fresh and choose his own guy.
PoliticalDiscussion,"Why? I get it, it would feel nice to hire back people who Trump fired as a fuck you to Trump, but is that it? Biden can find better people to fill these positions."
JoeRogan,"The GOP is literally trying to get hundreds of thousands of votes in some states thrown out, to get some states to not certify results, and to ultimately overturn the results of a presidential election. But yes, it’s them darn libs who are authoritarian."
JoeRogan,"Exactly. If a private company says “I don’t want that content on our site” and the federal government comes in and says “too bad, you have to keep it up or else”, what would you call that?"
JoeRogan,"I know we have a lot of issues going on in this world, like a global pandemic and an economic depression larger than we've seen in our lifetime, but you're right - Joe needs to talk more about why people have to click an extra button to retweet something. Or why Steve Bannon can get banned from Twitter for saying he wants to behead Fauci."
JoeRogan,"I know I'll probably get downvoted for this but yeah, of course, he's in charge of a publicly traded company. One wrong word and the Twitter stock could tank and he could face some serious SEC investigations. 

I'm mostly talking about the referring to his lawyer part, not the blaming the artificial intelligence thing."
cringe,It's a cult. I don't know how you watch this and listen to these people and conclude anything else.
cringe,I think we're all so fucking exhausted from all of this. Donald Trump has successfully brainwashed half of the country and now he's convinced them to completely distrust our democratic institutions and to believe he won all because his ego can't take the loss. It's insane.
JoeRogan,"I know this sounds like a nice edgy gotchya comment but it doesn't really have any logic to it. 

What exactly is your argument? That congressional Democrats should have refused to sign any bill that funded the military? That they should have shut down the entire government indefinitely? 

Its possible to deeply disagree and even despise the president while also recognizing that you have constituents that will suffer if you don't sign a spending bill. 

Not a single Democrat, or Republican for that matter, have ever suggested that we simply don't fund the military. Congrats, you've built a strawman argument."
JoeRogan,"Sure, I don’t necessarily disagree. But I don’t know how anyone can deny the reality that Republicans are very open about their love of military spending when Democrats have openly called for cuts. 

I mean I don’t hear AOC or Chuck Schumer calling for more spending on military weapons and tanks. I do see Trump and co doing exactly that."
JoeRogan,"> And during all of that, Pelosi and the Dems helped Trump pass a record Pentagon budget?

Isn't this just how negotiating spending bills works? No side gets all that they want, both sides have to make compromises in order to pass a budget. If they don't pass a budget, if both sides dig in and refuse to pass a bill unless it removes everything it doesn't agree with, then the government shuts down. 

I remember after Trump signed these budget bills, he often had press conferences where he celebrated the huge military spending. I don't remember a single democrat celebrating that."
JoeRogan,Ins't it Republicans who always want to increase military funding while Democrats have constantly suggested we make cuts and use that money elsewhere?
JoeRogan,"Exactly. Not wanting to yank troops out completely all at once isn't a left thing, it's bipartisan. Yesterday a handful of GOP Senators openly said this was a very dumb idea. 

Keep in mind that Trump had 4 years to pull all of our troops out but he didn't because his team knows what the consequences might be. But here we are, just days after Trump lost the election, and he clearly just wants to make good on a campaign promise regardless of the consequences because he won't be around to deal with them. 

If Trump pulls these guys out, and shit goes down in the middle east, not only are those problems now Biden's problems, but Trump will get to tweet about how Biden caused it to happen in the first place.

And for those who want to suggest that Trump actually cares about ending these wars, it was reported just yesterday that Trump has been asking military leaders this week for options for him to attack Iran."
fivethirtyeight,"I think wrongly interpret the 90% chance of winning as a 90% chance of having the stated polling average. No, it’s a 90% chance of winning."
JoeRogan,"Did Carlin ever stool hump? If not, that may be your answer."
AskTrumpSupporters,Why do we have to assume that? Can you name a single other time that Trump has used rhetoric to try to unite people?
JoeRogan,Nothing actually stops anyone from running 3rd party. But the reality of our political system is that running a serious 3rd party campaign guarantees a loss for you and the major party you’re most closely aligned to.
JoeRogan,oh wow I didn't realize Alex was that hilarious!!
AskTrumpSupporters,"So if Trump said he wouldn't have time for golf, but actually ends up playing golf every 4 days for 4 years straight, you think those 2 things aren't contradictory?"
AskTrumpSupporters,Trump said that Obama golfed too much and that he himself wouldn't have time for golfing. Do you think he lied?
cringe,"I honestly don't think she's delusional at all, I think she 100% knows that her argument is nonsensical and completely lacking any merit but it's ultimately her job to make those arguments on national TV because her boss' ego demands it."
cringe,You can tell that the reason she is mad and frustrated is because she put herself in a position to make what she knows are idiotic and nonsensical arguments on national TV
AskTrumpSupporters,"Trump has now spent 305 days playing golf since taking office, he is on track to have spent 1 out of every 4 days of his presidency playing golf. Do you think that's a lot of golf?"
JoeRogan,"Whenever Joe says this, I try to imagine how I would act if one of my friends did what Alex did. 

Imagine some 5 year old kid in your hometown was shot in the head. And a few weeks later you and your buddy are drinking and he says to you “I’m pretty sure those parents are just libs who faked their kids death to push some agenda”. That would be weird, right?

Then imagine he tells you that he’s actually been calling and emailing the grieving parents to call them out on their bullshit. And that the parents are taking him to court to make him stop. 

You’d be throughly weirded out, you’d hopefully question why you’re friends with that dude. But not Joe, Alex is just another funny guy who kills!!"
JoeRogan,"Well to be fair, in your friends' defense, Trump did ""hereby declare"" that he won Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. And I think *hereby declaring* a state overrides the actual vote."
JoeRogan,"It 100% is a cult. It's now at the point where the only person who they believe is being truthful is Donald Trump. Everyone else is a liar.

The media is lying, Fox News is lying, all of our intelligence agencies are liars, all politicians are liars, medical experts are lying, Dr. Fauci is a liar, scientists are a liar, climate experts are liars, everyone is a liar. 

The only person who knows everything about everything and is telling the truth is Donald Trump."
JoeRogan,"For sure! A few years back I was listening to him, and it was getting kinda crazy, but then he started talking about how all them kids at Sandy Hook were actually just crisis actors so he started harassing the grieving parents and it was hilarious!!!!

It was even more funny when the parents had to take out restraining orders and fight Alex in court to stop harassing them, adding to their stress of having to cope with having their children murdered. Honestly hilarious!!!"
JoeRogan,People say he's a nazi but he's kinda hilarious! Would def kill at the store
AskTrumpSupporters,What does this have to do with anything? Hillary conceded after the news outlets called it.
AskTrumpSupporters,"What does this mean?

Hillary conceded because the networks had called battleground states and the race for Trump. A concession is an informal admission of defeat, it doesn't stop the news outlets from calling states, it doesn't stop states from continuing to count and certify results."
JoeRogan,Qanon must be up in arms about this!
JoeRogan,Trump and Bill Barr's DOJ again looks the other way on Epstein related issues
AskTrumpSupporters,What has Trump been doing since the election? He’s had quite literally no events on his calendar since Election Day.
AskTrumpSupporters,"Again, what does conceding have to do with anything? Conceding is an informal recognition that someone has lost. Clinton conceded once the media outlets started calling battleground states. Conceding doesn’t stop states from continuing to count and certify results."
AskTrumpSupporters,">There's still a sitting president and the next two and a half months of the sitting president's term is almost nullified even though he's still around for a while after November 4.

How is this true? Trump can work, he can hold press conferences, he can govern just the way he has. Is he somehow unable to work because some media outlets are calling Biden president-election? Something that has happened in literally every single presidential election for decades. 

Is there something about Trump that makes him uniquely unable to govern during the lame duck period?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"Conceding is an informal thing, it doesn't mean anything other than admitting you have lost. And she did so after the media outlets called battleground states and the race. What exactly is your point?

Conceding doesn't stop states from counting all the votes, from certifying results, etc."
AskTrumpSupporters,"Sure, but isn't that what they do? They *project* the winner."
JoeRogan,"Going by this logic, nobody anywhere would be entitled to a critical opinion about anything. It's lazy and nonsensical. 

When Trump said that we needed to make american great again, did you want to tell him to leave the country? 

When black people complained about not having the right to vote in 1850, should we have told them to leave if they didn't like it?

If your boss tells you that you can do better at your job, do you tell him that he can leave the company if he doesn't like your work?"
JoeRogan,*If you don't like this country then leave!!!!*
JoeRogan,"I've been a fan of the podcast since 2013, I've listened to probably 4 or 5 episodes each week since then. I used to tell friends that what makes the JRE great is that Joe simply has really interesting people on, asks them questions that the average person would ask, and through that process we get to learn really interesting shit from interesting people.

But now? It's all right-wing politics, anti-science as it relates to covid, and just hours of Joe talking at people. 

And for those who are going to be like *hurr durr stop listening if you don't like it*, let me be clear - I'm complaining because I love the show and am sad to see it change for the worse so quickly."
JoeRogan,"Also be careful on that highway, nobody needs a drivers license to drive! Anyone, at any age, can drive because the government shouldn't control those things."
JoeRogan,"I just don't get it, like it's super clear that what is going on is that Trump is sad that he lost, his ego is bruised, and the people around him are yelling fraud to make him feel better.

Trump in 2012 said Obama beat Romney because of fraud. In 2016 Trump said Ted Cruz beat him in some primary state because of fraud. In 2016, weeks before the election, Trump said he might lose to Clinton because of fraud. And now that he's lost in 2020, it's because of fraud. 

Trump can't handle losing and his narcissistic brain demands that he come up with other conclusions to explain the loss."
AskTrumpSupporters,"There are Trump supporters in this thread arguing for exactly this, to ignore the popular vote and appoint electors themselves. What do you say to those people?"
AskTrumpSupporters,So you'd be fine if state legislators could just ignore the vote? What would be the point of even having a vote if the state legislators would just decide anyways?
JoeRogan,I've said this a few times over the last couple of months but I genuinely believe the JRE is just months away from being an outright right-wing talk radio show.
JoeRogan,"Yep, Joe got his brain pickled by Fox News, Ben Shapiro, and Tim Pool. And unfortunately you don't really come back from that."
JoeRogan,"FWIW most advertising isn’t done with the hopes that you’ll hear an ad for x product and then just go out and buy that product. It’s more subtle than that. 

And you may think you’re immune from advertising but all evidence points to the same conclusion - advertising works."
AskALiberal,"In 2016 he was indeed hated by all the other GOP primary candidates. Even after Trump was the nominee, people like Graham, Cruz, and Rubio called him vile. It wasn’t until late in the election did some of them get behind him. 

In 2020 he was the incumbent, you can’t primary an incumbent president. Anyone who tries ends up embarrassing themselves. 

These GOP senators probably decided early on in Trump’s presidency that they would play nice so that they’d have their (right-wing) reputation still intact whenever the next true GOP primary came around."
AskALiberal,"I think many GOP Senators tolerate and support Trump solely because they want to inherit his base and have his support when they themselves run for president one day. 

I think if Trump comes out wanting to run again in 2024, you could see a very real effort to stop that from happening. 

Basically ""we ate shit for you for 4 years, it's our turn""."

Conservative,"I think NC will indeed stay red but I think the rest of your analysis is spot on. I follow a handful of quantitative election analysts on twitter and to them it's not really a question of if Biden will win PA, it's about when it'll happen, tonight or tomorrow morning. Looks like PA will be Biden +2% by the time it's all over with. 

This could be wrong of course but it seems to be the accepted consensus amongst those who know how to analyze these things."
Conservative,"I'm a dem who lurks this sub quite a bit but I always thought I would be unwelcome / banned if I commented here. I guess that's not the case?

I'd love to be able to come here to chat every now and then"
AskALiberal,I think Tim Scott is exactly right. I think he's palatable to people across the aisle while being a reliable conservative. I think he would have a very good chance to win if he ran.
fivethirtyeight,"I'll take the unpopular opinion that at this point, with just 3 hours before the model freezes, who cares? We're going to get the real results tomorrow or in the following days, whether the 538 model has PA at +6 or +4 isn't going to matter much other than to make us feel temporarily a little more relieved"

whatisthisthing,This has been guessed a few times but this house isn’t located near an earthquake zone at all. It’s on the East coast.
whatisthisthing,There are a lot of guesses but I don’t think we’ve solved this one yet!
whatisthisthing,"No, nowhere near an earthquake area tbh"
whatisthisthing,"A few reasons I don't think it's just a bed:

* The planters. If you put a mattress in this thing, you would be flush with the planters. Meaning the blankets and sheets and everything would regularly interact with dirt and plants and flowers. That seems...odd.

* There's an outlet on the inside sides where the mattress would go. That would be covered up by a bed mattress. 

* And the Skylight is pretty blinding to anyone sleeping there, mornings would be awful. I sat up there and it was super duper bright, I couldn't imagine sleeping there."

So on Saturday I helped my friend move into a new house and a part of helping her move was getting furniture from a house across the street. The woman who lived across the street just recently committed medically-assisted suicide and lived in the home alone. She planned ahead and donated her furniture to my friend.


Anyways, this is one of the bedrooms we found. It’s small and has a giant wood bed built into the room. The bed is probably 5 and a half feet tall, made out of thick wood, has candle holders on both sides of the bed, the bed sits directly below a giant skylight, there are planters next to the bed for flowers and plants, and there’s a stairwell right behind the bed that runs to the basement.


I do know that the woman’s daughter died at a young age in the house. What in the world is this?"
pics,No the lady who owned the house recently died and I didn't know her. So I only know the few details that were provided to me
pics,I'm honestly wondering if it was a place to keep her daughter's body who died decades ago.
pics,"So yes, actually, the woman’s child passed away at the age of 30 about 15 or 20 years ago. She died in the house."
pics,So I do have an answer for that - those open up and are just shelves
pics,"As far as I have been told, only one person lived here"
pics,"Yes, they are"

Over the weekend I helped a friend retrieve furniture from a home that was recently put up for sale. The owner was an elderly woman who has lived in this house for decades. 

This bedroom that was found contains one massive bed, built into the floor, that sits directly below a large skylight. The bed has to be about 5 and a half feet tall, built out of thick wood, has two candle holders attached to it, and has planters running along the sides of the bed for plants and flowers. To the left of the bed is a stairwell that runs to the basement. 

It all just feels so strange. Why is it so large? Why right below a skylight? Why would you plant flowers alongside your bed? Why the stairwell right behind the bed going to the basement? 

Does anyone know what this is?"

But sure, point taken."

Slapping campaign signs on the front lawn and having a political rally here is an absolute disgusting break from norms and expected ethical behavior.

JoeRogan,"I think thats the tricky thing. You can't both say ""vote for me because I'm going to be tough on crime"" and then go and say ""don't vote for Harris because she's too tough on crime.""

The whole Trump campaign has been fixated on building the narrative that Biden is just a puppet of the super far left people like AOC and Sanders. So if you do a 180 and now try to convince voters that you shouldn't vote for Biden/Harris because they're too far in the middle....well thats just weird."
JoeRogan,Where in any of my comment did I say I think it would be a landslide?
JoeRogan,"Their prediction 2 months earlier likely gave Clinton better odds because she was polling better. The most accurate prediction is going to come closer to the election. What’s your point?

Biden is doing better than Clinton right now, he has a higher polling average than she ever had. But like I said, the race likely will tighten and there’s loads of time for Trump to come back and win this."
JoeRogan,"Brilliant, face based analysis. 

Yeah, he can win, but it’s not guaranteed or even the most likely scenario right now."
JoeRogan,"Laughably wrong?

On election day in 2016, their model predicted that Trump had a 29% chance of winning and [wrote an article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/) just days before the election saying Trump was within the margin of error of winning. 

>Still, Clinton’s lead is small enough that it wouldn’t take more than a normal amount of polling error to wipe the lead out and leave Trump the winner of the national popular vote.

A 29% chance is not 0%. Would you put a gun to your head and pull the trigger if there was a 29% chance it would fire a bullet?"

Using gloves to handle the turmeric (everything that touches it will turn yellow lol), I cut it into thin slices and just pop those into the bottle. I then do the same thing with fresh ginger. Then I squeeze and strain the juice from a single lemon and add that to the 5 bottles. And I usually add a little squirt of honey on top.

Each bottle probably gets 6 or 7 turmeric slices and 3 or 4 slices of ginger. 

And then yes, I just add the kombucha from the 1f and let it sit for 3 days."

How are these two things different? How is Biden dumb/weak when he wears a mask but Trump is awesome when he does?"

solotravel,Yeah Americans are technically on the list of people who can’t go. Canadians and (most?) Europeans can.
AskTrumpSupporters,"Yes of course, absolutely. That sort of test would be amazing. 

But Donald Trump had a press conference in the Rose Garden where he brought up the CEOs of Walmart and Abbot and said that these were about to be sent to every parking lot in Walmart. 

Why would Trump lie about that?"
JoeRogan,"It's not that I think lying about sexual assault or rape should go unpunished, its certainly something that should have real consequences. The point is that lying and rape are not the same, one is significantly worse than the other. 

If you lie about someone committing murder, should you also be eligible for the death penalty?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"Right, but your comment argues that Trump is a stark defender of the rights of state and local governments to make decisions on their own. 

But there are countless examples, maybe even more than the former, of Trump attempting to force states and cities to do as he pleases. 

So how can Trump be such a strong advocate of state's rights when there is so much evidence against it?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"Public schooling is in the federal domain? What does that mean?

Do states and local governments not have full control over when they decide to open, what they decide to teach, and almost everything involved with the running of a school?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"Is this always how the Trump administration approaches things?

When it comes to opening schools, why isn't the WH message that it should be up to states and local governments? Why is the message that schools need to reopen or they'll lose funding?

And when it comes to protests in American cities, why is the Trump administration sending in federal troops against the wishes of local and state governments?"
politics,"I will weigh in. 

Here at r/politics, we have spent a lot of time trying to define what is and isn't on-topic. This is what a story needs to be about to be considered on-topic:

* The running of US governments, courts, public services, legislation, and policy-making


* Elections and candidacies


* Political movements/demonstrations discussed explicitly in connection with advocacy for specific policies or political candidates


* Lobbying and funding, groups, and donors
Opinion and analysis articles that explicitly and significantly discuss the above


Herman Cain is not a sitting politician and hasn't been for a very long time. We can't open up our on-topic definition to include stories about the health of individuals who are not politicians. 

If we were to expand our definition to include any story about the health or death of anyone who was at any time connected to politics or someone who was vocally politically active, where would it stop?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"No, he did not say that part was fake news. He basically said so what, we did something similar a long time ago. Did you watch the video?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"ok so just to confirm, you are presented with 2 options:

* Talk to Putin about the allegations and take steps to protect American troops based off of unverified information (but verified enough to make it into the President's written briefing)

Or

* Do nothing because we can't 100% verify it, leaving US troops at risk of being killed. 

You go with option 2? Essentially protecting Putin's claim to innocence rather than protect American troops from being killed?"

JoeRogan,Dude Trump might be awful and sure he maybe kinda supports those who have trafficked children for sexual abuse but he’s hilarious! He kills on stage.
JoeRogan,"Exactly this. If Trump really has nothing to fear, it would have been a slam dunk to say something like “although we’re all innocent until proven guilty, she’s been accused of some seriously vile acts. I hope this results in the victims finally getting some justice”. 

But no, just “I wish her well”. 

If you want to put on a tinfoil hat, you could easily make the argument that Trump wants her to believe he’ll throw her a bone if she stays quiet."
JoeRogan,"It is both possible to like something and be willing to poke fun at it. This idea that nobody should ever be critical of Joe is so laughably childish. 

I suppose you’re one of those “if you don’t like this country then you can just leave” folks?"

AskTrumpSupporters,You’re not responding in good faith. What is the right response given this exact situation then?
AskTrumpSupporters,I don’t understand your point. You and I agree that Maxwell is awful but you’re giving Trump a pass for wishing her well and having literally zero ill words for her?
AskTrumpSupporters,"Can you name a time that Trump treated anyone other than a political ally with this gentle of a tone? 

A few times a week Trump tweets that this and that person should be tried with treason and thrown in prison. But with someone who has trafficked young children for sexual abuse, Trump simply ""wishes her well?"""
AskTrumpSupporters,"Can you name a time when, in the context of being thrown in prison/going to court, Trump treated someone other than a political ally with this gentle of a tone?"
JoeRogan,Look below in the comments. Anyone suggesting that this doesn't have to do with Epstein is getting double digit downvotes.
PoliticalDiscussion,"> I can scarcely imagine a Biden statement that would be plausible and break through the Trump/COVID noise.

I agree with most of your points but I think you are underestimating the GOP's ability to turn a small blunder into the *scandal of a lifetime*. Remember Clinton's deplorable comment? Trump said 1,000s of vile, repulsive, incredibly offensive things but Clinton makes one small mildly bad comment and thats the thing that defines the race."
AskTrumpSupporters,"Wallace asked because Trump recently mentioned it out of the blue on a Fox News Interview with Sean Hannity. 

How is this the media’s fault?"
AskTrumpSupporters,I think the belief is that Republicans think Obama largely created significant policy with his DACA executive order so Trump now believes he can create complex and significant policy alone without congressional approval. How do you feel about that?
AskTrumpSupporters,"I...agree with you? 

I don’t think he can do much of any of this with an executive order however. Also I think you’re describing the system that Germany uses for the most part. 

What are the odds of him doing this you think?"

What evidence would you need to be convinced that this is wrong?"

If we spot them elsewhere, we will pick them up elsewhere. And if we have a question about somebody's identity, like the first example I noted to you, after questioning determine it isn't someone of interest, then they get released. And that's standard law enforcement procedure, and it's going to continue as long as the violence continues.""

They are grabbing people they think are responsible for graffiti and questioning them. 

The DHS can't just send in federal troops without Trump's approval. 

What do you make of this now?"

politics,"It's probably because for the most part, it's a theory that a large portion of the public wants to believe in. And to add fuel to the fire, elected officials, including the President of the United States, routinely share content from Qanon folks and give credibility to the whole thing."

AskTrumpSupporters,"Biden did poorly in the primaries but won it by more than any modern dem?

How did establishment Dems conspire?"
AskTrumpSupporters,The same was true for Biden during the primary. His opponents had huge rallies and Biden’s were mostly dead but somehow he won the primary easily. Do you think social media follower count and audience size are the best predictive measures?
SonyAlpha,Nice spot. I worked right near here for years
userexperience,"Absolutely, that’s what I’m seeing. And to be honest, if you’re at an established company with some sort of design system, the UI part becomes quite easy."
userexperience,"Sure, they might be stronger in one area or another but it doesn’t mean they can’t or won’t do the other. 

Yeah maybe companies do want people who can wear multiple hats at once but here’s the secret - lots of people can do exactly that. 

I might be cynical but my experience is that those who “just want to do UX” usually just don’t have the UI skills or willingness to learn them."
userexperience,"I think it's funny that you're getting downvoted when you're 100% right. The industry is moving towards one person handling these two things and you can either stick to your ground or adapt.

I've been at 3 different companies so far and none of them have had separate UX and UI. We have had research and product designers however which seems to be the new default state."

Nobody says you have to apologize when you make a mistake, you just need to correct it and move on."
PoliticalDiscussion,"This is a good point. One other thing about this, he was a challenger, not the incumbent. 

The ""law and order"" messaging is harder to pull off when you're suggesting you'll bring law and order to a chaotic society that you now control."
cringe,"I think this is the definition of whataboutism. We’re talking about Trump, this has nothing to do with Biden. 

And yes, whenever I listen to Biden talk I hold my breath because he stumbles too much. He also has had a lifelong stutter and he corrects himself when he fucks up. I’d rather vote for someone who corrects his mistakes than someone who is narcissistic and completely unwilling to admit wrong."
cringe,"Why would you cover it up instead of just correcting yourself?

Let’s think about Biden’s gaffe last week when he said 150 million Americans are dead instead of 150 thousand. He quickly corrected himself but imagine he didn’t, he just ran with it and was like “now people say 150,000 are dead but it could be 150,000,000, nobody truly knows!”

It would be entirely nonsensical. Strength isn’t never admitting wrong, strength and leadership is admitting wrong and doing whatever you can to do right."
JoeRogan,"Right. But people were saying we shouldn’t consider candidate trump to be seriously able to win. When people said this, Trump was a formal candidate. 

I’m saying Kanye hasn’t launched a website, no plan to get on ballots (you can’t just get your name on ballots), nothing. Im saying he hasn’t actually entered the race yet."
JoeRogan,"Maybe, but not a chance that anyone over the age of 35 votes for Kanye. Plus Kanye has spent the last 2 years wearing his MAGA hat and being very vocal about his support of Trump. It's not necessarily obvious who would suffer more from a serious Kanye candidacy. 

It's also worth keeping in mind that Kanye is promoting an album at the moment and has used publicity stunts in the past to promote things. Until he has a website and takes serious steps here, we should not consider this to be serious."

worldnews,"I’ve followed this case closely and Biden’s name comes up nowhere. Nothing. 

And keep in mind that the SDNY is handling this case and the AG on the case is a respectable prosecutor. The person Barr tried to install there, someone who was never a prosecutor, wasn’t able to be put in place. 

So I do have some faith."

boston,"Thanks! This was taken with a Sony A7r3 camera and a 24-70mm lens. I shot it on my tripod at about 5 seconds. 

This bridge is actually a bit tricky for long exposure shots since the train and the cars that run on the bridge actually shake the bridge quite a bit. Any shot longer than 3 or 4 seconds seems to get camera shake regardless of how secure your tripod is."

Most people who mass like your stuff are actually just trying to get noticed and to get more followers."
PoliticalDiscussion,"How were the polls wrong? 

The polling average, just days before the election, was Clinton up 3%. Clinton ended up winning by about 2.5% but lost a few states by razor thin margins.

And X is never something that you should be murdered for."
JoeRogan,"I'm really just at a loss with this argument. You concede that masks are indeed effective, its just that people can't be expected to wear them so they aren't effective at the population level? 

It's perfectly circular logic - we shouldn't wear masks because other people won't wear masks so it won't be effective so don't wear a mask."
JoeRogan,"No the correct analogy would be condoms. You’re saying they’re not effective at stopping pregnancies because some people just won’t wear them. 

Masks work on the individual level. If you have COVID and wear a mask, you’re significantly less likely to pass it on to others. Do you disagree with that?"
JoeRogan,"What? This is like saying antibiotics aren’t effective because if you stop taking them early they don’t work and nobody has the patience to keep taking them. 

Masks and social distancing is fucking effective. Had we not done both we’d have like 2 million people dead but instead we only have 120,000. 

This is just such nonsense."

These kids on TikTok did nothing to stop people from getting into the venue, the only thing they did was willingly give their data to the Trump campaign. This venue is empty because not that many people showed up and this is further backed up by the fact that the Trump camp had an outdoor stage ready for the “overflow” of attendees which they tore down right before Trump went on stage because there was no overflow."

I shot on a Fuji camera for years up until just a few weeks ago.

AskTrumpSupporters,"Again, that’s not how this works. 

It’s not that you can’t fire someone who is transgender (or gay, a woman, etc), it’s that you can’t fire someone simply for being transgender. 

If you’re doing poorly at work, and you to try to prevent being fired by saying you’re trans, it doesn’t matter at all, your company can just fire you for doing poorly at work. Case closed. 

You would have to prove they only wanted to fire you for being transgender and nothing else. Do you get it?"

boston,Thank you
JoeRogan,"I think people are completely missing the point. I'm not here to talk about whether or not you agree with Drew Brees or BLM or whatever - the point is that the exact same people who tell black athletes to ""shut up and dribble"" are the same people who are like ""Drew Brees is a person and deserves to be heard."" 

People deserve to be heard, that's fine, people are also free to criticize their words too, thats also fine. What's not cool is to selectively decide who should and shouldn't get a right to say something and its doubly uncool when the people you think shouldn't have a right to say something are often black men."
JoeRogan,"I’m not making or sharing my opinion on the matter. I never said anything about what whether I agree or not with Drew Brees. 

The point is that there’s a difference between having the right to say something and whether or not people will face consequences for saying it."
JoeRogan,What is political about kneeling in the name of police brutality? How is that more political than the military
JoeRogan,"We're talking about people silently kneeling during the national anthem, not people giving speeches about social justice or whatever. The actual national anthem isn't even sports! 

During sports games for decades we've had military plane flyovers, politicians throwing out the first pitch, honoring the military during halftime, singing the national anthem - all of these things are political, none of these things are about sports, and all of these things are much louder than silently kneeling without saying a single word.

It's fairly clear that it's not the act of kneeling which bothers people no matter how much they say it, it's who is doing it and what they stand for. Watch the video I posted and tell me I'm wrong."

NetflixBestOf,"If someone doesn't know the story, which I assume almost everyone who watches this documentary doesn't, then you absolutely can ruin a documentary for someone. Half of the documentary builds up to this moment and you really don't know if it's going to end this way."

userexperience,"UX is about solving user and business problems through design. You should be focus on learning the basics of user experience design first. Get the books **The Elements of User Experience**,  **Don't Make Me Think**, and **Hooked**. All 3 will help you begin to understand the UX process and thinking that goes into our work. 

You solve these user and business problems with design by using design tools like Sketch and prototyping tools like InVision. There are processes before and after the actual design step, those will be explained by the books I recommended. 

I have been doing this job for 6 years, with 3 different companies, in 2 countries, and I have worked with probably 50 UX designers - not one of us spent any amount of time learning Javascript, HTML, or CSS. We maybe knew the basics, enough to have a basic conversation with developers, but thats it.

Read the books I suggested and then go from there."

>The special note said that if this “misclassification error” had not occurred, the “overall unemployment rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher than reported,” meaning the unemployment rate would be about 16.3 percent for May. But that would still be an improvement from an unemployment rate of about 19.7 percent for April, applying the same standards.

>In the interviews, conducted by navy investigators looking into Gallagher’s conduct during a tour of duty in Iraq in 2017, fellow platoon members told of a ruthless leader who stabbed the captive to death for no reason then forced his troops to pose for a photograph with the corpse.

>At his court martial, Gallagher was acquitted of murder but demoted in rank for the lesser charge of posing with the body – a decision Trump reversed.

>**In a lengthy criminal investigation report, the navy detectives laid out other allegations against Gallagher, including shooting a schoolgirl and elderly man from a sniper’s roost.** Members of Alpha Platoon’s Seal Team 7 alarmed by their leader’s conduct said they were initially shut down by military chiefs when they first spoke up, and told their own careers would suffer if they continued to talk about it.

It's not in this source but allegedly his platoon members started messing with his gun so it would be less accurate, hoping to stop him from killing more civilians."

AskTrumpSupporters,Was that actually the question I asked? Is it not conceivable to accept criticism and still vote for the person being criticized?
AskTrumpSupporters,"Yes definitely inspired by Mattis' article. 

As far as I can tell, Mattis for years was loved by Trump and people on the right. When he left the WH, Trump offered praise and said he had done a great job. 

Yesterday, after his article, Trump said he was always awful, did a terrible job, shouldn't have hired him. Do you think thats actually the case?"

JoeRogan,Why are people not realizing that the comment you’re replying to was a joke?
JoeRogan,"And what’s not being talked about is how Trump is doing more drone strikes than Obama. What’s different is that Trump loosened the reporting standards around drone attacks, they are no longer forced to report on them.

Why aren't we talking about this anymore? Because the GOP's guy is in charge and he's not only doing the same thing, he's doing more of it. Killing civilians in combat zones is no longer a politically advantageous thing to point out. In fact, Trump not only [pardoned a man who killed civilians in war zones for fun](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/27/eddie-gallagher-trump-navy-seal-iraq), but that man is now campaigning with Trump."

Saying antifa is a terrorist group is the same thing as saying conservatism is a terrorist group. Would that make sense? No of course not, it’s not an organization."

The job market is just completely saturated with junior designers from these sorts of programs. 

Even half of my class, which graduated when bootcamps were a new thing and the UX job market was HOT, ended up in non-UX roles. A lot of them ended up giving up after a while."

They’ll remove comment sections, you won’t be able to see your posts on Facebook or twitter until they’ve been manually reviewed and approved by a moderator. 

Remember when Trump said Scarborough committed murder? Yeah they’d have to remove that because it could be libel. 

This wouldn’t discourage censorship, it would very actively require it."
Conservative,"If you make social media companies legally liable for the content on their site then no, the only option is for them to very strictly moderate all content and to remove anything that might come close to getting them in trouble. I really don’t think people are getting what the EO is trying to do which is a bit disconnected from his words."
Conservative,"Ok so play this out - twitter and Facebook and all other social media sites are now liable for user posted content. 

What do these sites do? Remove comment sections, don’t show tweets or Facebook posts until they’ve been reviewed by a moderator. Remove anything that might get them in trouble. 

This doesn’t prevent censorship, it very actively encourages it."
AskTrumpSupporters,Did you not read the body text where I explicitly call that out?
boston,"I don’t know, do you like it?"

This gatekeeping around what is and isn't real photography is dumb."
photography,"lol yeah what? What are these rules? Who wrote them? Who enforces them? 

The idea that there are ""rules"" in photography and that your photos can be ""disqualified"" by some unnamed entity for doing something in post is preposterous.

As a photographer, you learn to understand where people’s eyes go on an image and in what order. My eye, and I would guess most others, immediately goes to the billboard. 

It’s a great image, OP does great work and is probably one of the better photographers in all of Boston (I follow them on insta), but to say that the billboard isn’t distracting is just not true."
JoeRogan,"Exactly. Of course it would be nice of Joe to do that but it's just not how things are done. If someone moves on from a business, and they sign no sort of contract or put into place any sort of measure to reap future profits, then you simply aren't owed anything."
JoeRogan,I think this is right. People should keep in mind that this is the same as a startup going public or being sold and people asking if employees who left long before should get some of the payout. The answer is no unless they have some contract in place.
userexperience,They also wrote a book about all the data which was super interesting.
photography,"Thanks for the response. I just want to again reiterate that I’m thankful for what you do, you’re very thoughtful with how you mod this sub."
photography,"I like this sub, I appreciate the work that clondon has and continues to put into it, but I've also had bad experiences with some of the others in charge. I posted something, it was removed, and then when I inquired about it in modmail, I got an incredibly rude and aggressive response from two mods and was then muted. Super disheartening and frustrating."
JoeRogan,"I'm pretty liberal and I listen to the show every now and then. I find some of the stuff he says to be reasonable but more often than not I find his arguments to be inconsistent with his past opinions or moral principles. He very obviously ignores his own principles and panders to the base every now and then. 

I remember an episode quite a while back where he was bashing some Democrat for being ""morally bankrupt"" but then a few episodes later he was talking about how although Trump fucked a pornstar while his wife was pregnant, that's just consistent with the Trump that we know, so therefore we can't be all that mad about it. 

Things like that where if Shapiro truly was this fair, logical, and principled thinker, he wouldn't say shit like that. But he does. All the time."
JoeRogan,"Listen, you're right. If people really don't want to get covid, or want to easily survive it, they need to stop flying first class (travel is hard on the immune system), sauna more often, take your vitamins, and listen to Jocko. 

If you get covid its your own damn fault at this point. Covid is for immunobetas and grandmas."
AskWomen,"Killing Eve is one of the best TV shows out right now yet it’s flying under the radar for most. It’s so well done, so unique and refreshing."

AskTrumpSupporters,"When you were a little kid and got into fights with others, did you ever find “well he started it!” to be a good excuse?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"So the Chinese unleashed this virus first on themselves, and then the rest of the world, as some sort of plot to destroy America?"
AskTrumpSupporters,So you agree that Trump is politicizing it?
AskTrumpSupporters,Today he said any study on the drug that concluded it was ineffective or harmful was probably done by Democrats. How is that not politicizing it?
AskTrumpSupporters,Did you know that the virus has effected other countries besides us?
JoeRogan,Oh I get it. You're allowed to voice your opinion on Rogan but only if that opinion is the right one.
JoeRogan,"Ah yes, a good faith analysis of what I said. I usually don’t finish an episode all at once, I listen to half a day. And I obviously skip some podcasts and some days I don’t listen. 

But damn did you get me with that edginess."
pics,Yeah I do photography as well and this photo just doesn't sit right with me. It just looks...off.
JoeRogan,"Every day listener for 8 years here. It’s us who have been listening for years and years who have become frustrated with the direction this podcast has taken. 

It used to be just Joe asking really smart people questions so the viewers got to learn something new. Now it’s just Joe entertaining conspiracy theories for hours."
AskTrumpSupporters,"That user is indeed wrong. The documentation provided by the hotel lists the room rate, as its own line item, with the rate being $397. [source](https://twitter.com/Fahrenthold/status/1261332011857448966?s=20).

This cost per room is what the hotel charges regular guests. You can say you'd be willing to pay more but thats not what they charge. Why are they charging market rate when they said they'd only charge the government ""like $50""?"
JoeRogan,"Every day I tune into the latest episode assuming he's moved on from it and is able to have a regular episode. But nope, episode after episode it's the same rich man complaining about regular Joe's not getting back to work."
AskTrumpSupporters,"I'm not asking you to support Biden or anything, just asking about whether or not the Trump businesses are intentionally profiting off of their situation. Do you think it's possible that Eric Trump and the Trump properties have simply chosen to charge full rate because they can?"
JoeRogan,Oh you got COVID? It’s probably because you’ve been traveling a lot and your immune system is down.
JoeRogan,"Yeah this is refreshing. I'm only a few minutes into the podcast but for the first time in weeks, I'm hearing a guest and Joe talk about the virus actually being dangerous for once. I love Elon Musk but damn, his episode was hard to listen to, he's just so out of touch with reality."
photography,I’m only now realizing that’s not the case. Was v confused for a moment.
AskALiberal,"Because Trump would have to face the hard reality that the country saw him as president and decided that they didn't like it rather than giving him this opportunity to be a martyr and to scream ""DC elites removed me from office!"""
AskALiberal,"When the Senate decides whether or not to convict a president after he is impeached by the house, they shouldn't be thinking whether they want the current president or vice president to be president, they should be asking themselves if the president is guilty of the acts he was impeached for. The answer has always been yes with Trump."
TrueAskReddit,"Sure, we can understand more complex things with the help of language. That doesn’t mean we’ve eliminated our intellectual ceiling, however. 

It’s still likely that we’ll never be able to see the big picture, it’s still likely that we’re just too small and simple to understand the entire thing and it’s meaning."
cringe,"I'd argue a better example is Russia. And the whole not wearing masks thing is similar to those photos of Putin riding a horse while shirtless. 

The point is to project this hyper macho masculine persona. The point is to project that the people in the WH are so amazing, so macho, so superhuman, that they don't need masks because they can't get the disease."
TrueAskReddit,">	If both those are true then we can in theory eventually discover how this universe works and understand any meaning it has.

I think this conclusion is very flawed. We as humans almost certainly have an intellectual ceiling which will never allow us to comprehend our universe fully and any meaning it has. 

Here on earth, every single species has an intellectual ceiling. The smartest animals on earth, no matter how hard you try, will never understand economics, how a car engine works, or even what a road is for. These concepts are just too complex for non-human species, they are literally incapable of understanding. 

We should assume that we as humans also have this ceiling. We should assume that even if we conduct an infinite number of studies over an infinite amount of time, we almost certainly will never fully grasp our universe and it’s meaning if it exists."
userexperience,"I've been doing UX for about 6 years now, I've worked at three different companies in two different countries, and all of them have used UI and visual design interchangeably. If you want to make that distinction then of course do so but let's not try to argue that it's not ok to say visual design instead of UI."
boston,This is what Drizly does but with alcohol and the stores in your area

photography,"Funny to see this video here, I actually followed this video 2 days ago and made my own which turned out great. 

I will say that as someone who hasn't used premiere pro before, I had to google a lot of things about using it to make this work. My computer, which usually handles video fairly well, also struggled to process the image sequence in Premiere Pro. 

Overall a really fun and unique thing to make."
userexperience,How exactly do you plan on “shaming” companies?
AskALiberal,"I’ll probably take a more nuanced opinion than others here, I hope I don’t get bashed for it. 

I think it was a bad idea to cancel it, I think it’s a good thing that it’s back on, but I also don’t think the court has any right to tell a political party how to conduct its nomination process. 

Keep in mind, political parties can select a nominee however they want, they are private organizations. They could just draw names out of a hat if they wanted to."
news,"A man is jogging and two guys are waiting for him with guns. He’s shot and killed before he can get around their car. 

The fact that you can’t see the injustice here is exactly why racism and race fueled violence still persists today."
news,"The white guys were trying to “citizens arrest” the jogging black man. The person filming is a friend of the two white men in the truck, giving weight to the idea that all of this was planned. 

What would you do if you’re a black man in Georgia and two white guys with guns pointed at you try to stop you?

This is planned, calculated murder."
NetflixBestOf,The 2nd to last episode is one of the better episodes of TV I’ve seen in a long time
userexperience,"If you are looking to get permission to share the work then yes by all means do this. 

But as a UX designer, building a case study out of work you did at a company is as expected as putting the job on your resume. 

You wouldn’t contact your old company to say “by the way I’m going to put my experience here on my resume, thanks!” If Someone did that you’d probably think it’s strange."
userexperience,No I’ve never done this and never even thought about it. My first reaction is that it sounds strange?
AskTrumpSupporters,"Is his MO to praise an authoritarian and murderous dictator who starves his own people while building up nuclear weapons that are pointed at the US?

SonyAlpha,"Thank you :) 

First tip is good light. Light is everything, there's nothing more important than getting the right light for a shot. 

I shoot strictly at golden hour, both at sunrise and sunset. The light is soft, colorful, and really gives the whole scene a nice punch."
JoeRogan,What? Is that what I said? I said we should all have equal say when electing someone to represent us equally.
JoeRogan,"They just seem unable to consider the idea that maybe some folks work an office job that they truly enjoy? They seem to think office job = dead quiet, cubical, boring meetings with monotone managers, everyone wearing a tie, awful work environment."
JoeRogan,"That's why we have the Senate - arguably the most influential and powerful body in our government which gives equal representation to all states. California has exactly the same level of representation as Kentucky, for example. 

Yes, I agree that whats good for cities isn't always whats good for rural areas, what's good for Texas isn't necessarily what's good for Ohio. But we have both the Senate and even the House, both give representation to all areas. 

The President is the president of all people equally, we should all get an equal vote."

pics,"I just got back from living abroad for a few years and this sentiment is widely shared. The rest of the world largely looks at America now as some joke reality show gone wrong. 

I know there’s some Americans who think the world takes us seriously now but that couldn’t be any further from the truth. We’ve entered into a new era where the US isn’t looked to for leadership anymore, we’re laughed at and seen as a warning for how things can go wrong."
pics,Yeah all the time
pics,It’s a game in the sense that I also don’t know which one exactly. I believe it’s the middle left blue one but I’m not confident
userexperience,"> UI design isn’t the core responsibility

Maybe not responsibility, but core output. 

It's great that some UX designers get to focus strictly on research and wireframing, and they have a UI designer to hand things off to, but that's a luxury for most. Using the example of photography like someone did below, this is like saying you can get by as a photographer by only taking photos but never editing and actually sending files to clients. That's a picture taker, not a photographer. 

I know many UX designers who only want to focus on this big picture stuff and don't necessarily want to do UI work but those are the people I've seen struggle to get jobs and move up. At the end of the day, companies want people who can produce assets in addition to the big picture thinking."
boston,"I left my house for the first time in a few weeks to take this photo. The Park was FULL of people including many large groups (8+ people) with no masks. When did people just give up on social distancing?

travel,Same. I’ve seen and done a lot but this was the best thing I’ve experienced yet
itookapicture,"It’s all subjective so differing opinions is expected, but I’ve personally found that adding humans like this can really effectively add a sense of scale and relatability. Viewers can more easily seen themselves at the scene because of it."
itookapicture,Taking pictures with people in it? That trend has been around for a while now.
boston,"Just because you can, doesn’t mean it’s financially wise. If you’re young and single then sure, but that 2.5k extra a month won’t get you far if you’re interested in saving, have other bills (like student loans, car insurance) and want to travel."

Boston is expensive but if you hold a decent job and live with roommates, you can find apartments in Cambridge or Somerville easily."
JoeRogan,"In my real life, in conversations with friends, family, and even people online, this isn’t a topic of conversation at all. It’s a non-issue. But whenever I listen to this podcast it’s like I’ve entered this new reality where the biggest issue facing our country right now is Political Correctness."
photography,"Yes vantage point absolutely plays a big role too, I didn’t mean to discount or ignore these other contributing factors. But as someone else mentioned, telephoto lenses compress the scene and make things seem much closer together than they really are."
userexperience,You can set up a screener survey and then they’ll give you a pool of people to choose from who answers your questions a certain way.
aww,That's illegal
SonyAlpha,I’m just switching over to full frame but shot on a 35mm prime for a while (55mm full frame equivalent). I like the compression that gave me so the 85mm feels like it could be right
SonyAlpha,How do you like the versatility of this lens? I’m debating on picking it up for night street photography but I don’t want something that I’ll rarely use
AskReddit,"Eh Germany is a bit complex (lived there as an expat). 

Some cities like Berlin are very diverse and accepting of other cultures and people, but many parts of Germany are very much white and not all that accepting. 

And either way, regardless of where you are in Germany, it never feels like non-Germans are ever seen as fully in the circle, they’re always outsiders."

""True, but he sells out arenas and he kills"""

He says he asked it sarcastically to own the reporters. And he says he never asked his medical experts to look into it. 

Do you think he was being sarcastic? Should we and the media have assumed he was being sarcastic? If so, is sarcastically saying we should ingest disinfectant a good idea?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"Trump just said he asked this as a form of sarcasm. If he didn't say it, why would Trump say the thing he didn't say was sarcasm?"
AskTrumpSupporters,Trump says he was being sarcastic. Do you believe him?
AskTrumpSupporters,Trump just said that he was being sarcastic. Does that change anything?
AskTrumpSupporters,Do you believe Trump is for Universal Basic Income?
AskTrumpSupporters,But you're saying Trump out lefted the left when literally everyone on the left voted for this bill to give people money. How is what you're saying accurate?
AskTrumpSupporters,"How did Trump give everyone “free” money?

(1) congress is the one who wrote the bill for that, a bill that was passed with unanimous consent 

(2) that’s not free money, it’s our tax money."
AdviceAnimals,"Trump, just an hour ago, suggested that because heat may slow the spread of the disease, that we should try ""injecting light into the body"" to see if that works. And if that doesn't work, he suggested we try injecting disinfectant into the body since that works on surfaces.
