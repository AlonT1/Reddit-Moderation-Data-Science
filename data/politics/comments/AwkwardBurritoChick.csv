politics,"Hm. COmpared to the rest of the speech, this was just a sort of short section.  I didn't highlight any section of it because it's well written.  

The TLDR is pretty much that in AUgust this DepAG who is replacing Barr temporarily said there was no way for fraud to happen in our election and that we shouldn't bite into attempts to get us to be divided or lose faith in our election integrity."

>^Washington, ^DC ^~ ^Wednesday, ^August ^26, ^2020

>The 2020 Landscape

> At this point, I want to touch briefly on the current threat landscape as we head toward Election Day.  ***The department of Justice, DHS, and other federal agencies, have engaged in an unprecedented level of coordination with and support to all 50 states and numerous local officials to ensure that their election infrastructure is secure.***  We have yet to see any activity intended to prevent voting or to change votes, and we continue to think that it would be extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to change vote tallies.
> 
> We do, however, continue to see malign foreign influence efforts relevant to the 2020 presidential election.  Some foreign actors are covertly trying to undermine confidence in our elections because they are authoritarian governments opposed to representative democracy.  

>As the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) recently made public on August 7, some foreign governments have preferences about our election — and have taken or planned malign activities in support of their preferences — including efforts by China and Iran to undermine President Trump and his Administration’s policies and efforts by Russia to undermine former Vice President Biden.  

>***The Intelligence Community, including the FBI, have briefed Congress, as well as both presidential campaigns, about these threats.  ODNI also has also taken unprecedented steps to educate the public about these threats to “better inform Americans so they can play a critical role in safeguarding our election.”***
> 
> We are working to counter all of these influence activities. ***But it is important to remember that there are times when drawing attention to the threats can be precisely what the bad actors want, to generate concern and distrust, division and discord.  And as Americans, we need to avoid the temptation to seek political advantage from the revelation of influence activities that were meant to divide us.*** 
> 
> Instead, the right response is for our electorate to be knowledgeable and careful about the sources of information they rely on, to look for accurate information, to inform themselves about the candidates, and to cast their ballots accordingly.  In the words of Thomas Jefferson, “I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves.”  So let me offer some final thoughts about what the historical records tells us that Americans can do to protect ourselves from the malign influence efforts of foreign governments, in addition to the strong measures being taken by the Justice Department and other government agencies."
politics,"OHhh yes... I see.  I've been following Mike Dunford
@questauthority on Twiter as he gives really good breakdowns."
politics,"Or ""The one with"" descriptions, like the episodes of Friends or dates on the state pages. 

""The one with Trump requesting recount of 2 Counties""

""The one with Sidney Powell and Lin Wood aka Kraken 2 of 4: Arizona Case""

""The one with Rudy Guilliani""


LOL but really, amazing job and work."
politics,"Yea, been following him and a few others.  Elias and his organization, democracydocket.com is a great resource uploading all the filed documents.  Just wish they'd date or explain a little better which case is which though that's a petty annoyance considering the work they're doing! 

At this point it seems the Krakens are all about to die in their second rounds which is fine by me.  Powell and Lin need to just stop all their bullshit on and off line."
politics,"And of course, these constant sticky situations are because Trump is a victim, I'm sure.   Trump can't escape this election as the election system was put in place to prevent what he is trying to do.  The whole reason for states to manage their own voting laws is to prevent any one person like the President from trying to tip the scales too much.    

The other thing Trump can't manage to escape is COVID. While he ignores it, the virus isn't going to be tweeted away or over litigated into oblivion. 

It's also amazing if it takes THIS much work and effort for one person to win an election, it's definitely not stolen.   The Texas lawsuit was more overt collusion to steal an election than any one precinct or county.   

Seems amazing that thousands of officials, judges, clerks, volunteers, observers were or are in the Biden stealing a win, they did so in a manner so covertly that it's almost like.... it doesn't exist.   I mean so many thousands of people and incredible at covering all their footprints! (/s)"
politics,"Not so much the media as it's been the GOP and Trump who have been and will be fighting every step of the way, 55 cases to try to invalidate tens of millions of votes and/or ""deceritify"", the pressure and humilation on Kemp and other Governors/states,  not conceding and overtly trying to challenge and obstruct.  Trump truly thinks he won and that it's stolen.  So the public interest is to make sure the process is happening.   This anxiety isn't from MSM, it's coming from Trump and dripping down with his rants of 'fraud' for the past few months, the litigation and the GOP adding to the shit show rather than just accepting Biden has won."
politics,No he cannot be an elector nor can active Congress people (State and Federal).
QAnonCasualties,I didn't know that.. and explains why he brags about being able to read Chinese.  I knew he was in Japan as it was indicated in his affidavit..  The guy - I have no idea how he's not been banned on Twitter. he was doing overt calls to action for people to harass delivery drivers to 'protect' the voting machines so they could be impounded and investigated even though there was no such thing happening since the GA early voting for the run offs were being prepared.
politics,"This PDF from Congress explains the entire process pretty clearly. https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641

Mind you the votes were certified by each Governor as to the votes and assigned electorates. Copies of the Certificate of Acertianments sent to the National Archives.  The Electors vote today and their votes sent to Congress for the Joint Session and VP counts out loud the votes from each state. 

At the Joint Session to challenge electors will require at least a written objection by one House member AND a Senate member. Then there is 2 hours to deliberate.  

This is normally not such a show or event. It's normally just a procedure but as usual, Trump and the GOP are obstructing at any and every opportunity in desperate attempts to keep Trump in place.  Yet failing to realize it's this chicanery that caused many to vote for Biden."
politics,"I have a theory or belief about this.  Originally when the Constitution was ratified, the 'compromise' of allowing POC men to vote but at a 3/5 and in many states simply enslaved, that now 240ish years later that the whole women and POC voting is simply going to ruin this centuries old system, designed to be only and primarily for rich, powerful white men, is losing it's power. 

I cannot help that the fear of more people voting meaning minorities, women, the LGTBQ community - means they lose their power.   And a few years back there was an amazing post breaking down how the Republicans aren't' for liberty, equality, justice - it's all power though I didn't save it on Reddit. But the theory stuck.

Especially as this year made me dig a little deeper into Black history in our country, and definitely was amazed by the 1619 Project last year, that when you look at reconstruction, Jim Crowe, Civil Rights Movements, then seeing the most prominent Civil Rights leaders assassinated (Lincoln, JFK, Bobbie Kennedy, Malcom X, MLK Jr) it's apparent that there is a strong disdain for all men (and women) may be created equal, but apparently not intended to having equal rights.   

The fact that in 2020 that the Voting Rights Act has been gutted and if there was any time to say that voting is a sacred right, is now.  The Senate can just pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act - instead, it's on McConnells stack of bills intended to die on his desk."
QAnonCasualties,"I have been going in deeper in the Twitter Q rabbit hole and I'm finding the spreaders and creators are these sort of toxic masculinity military LARPers and the most confrontational consumers are older women (Well, my age and I'm in my 50's).. who just don't really even have much understanding in general of politics or civics. 

One woman seemed to have a moment in which I said ""These these are only true in three places: Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube"".  The MSM doesn't report this stuff because these things do not exist anywhere else where there would logically be proof if true.   

She had a few tweets back to me showing she was processing this blunt statement then blocked me. 

IN regards to the topic, I've been following the post election legal cases.  So this was a rare moment in which the Quniverse met with the legal world.  One based on allegations, conjecture, misinformation, etc to a world based on facts, evidence, rules, procedure and a process that is well documented in Court rules and laws. 

The Kraken cases were a gift in that regard. To see Q spreaders, including a lawyer in Trump's orbit who was also Flynns orbit, see how she promoted bullshit on Twitter and watch how it was processed in Court.   For those unaware, not well. 

She and Lin Wood have done such a shitty job, it will be amazing if they do not get any sanctions, disbarred or another reprimand.  The cases were handled poorly, typo-ridden submissions to Federal Courts, and even uploaded a blank form to the court, asking to appeal an emergency order they requested and were granted level stuff."
QAnonCasualties,"These fuckers are relentless.  Ron Watkins was literally scraping for any photos of Democrats with any Chinese official and even tried to pass off some redheaded woman as Amy Klobachar.  

Seems people like him will dig up shti like Governors, COngresspeople, Senators (State and Federal) with Chinese DIPLOMATS and just make a very ambiguous caption and then people makeup shit and run with it. 

As to the whole ""Chinese military training in Canada"" that's also been strongly exaggerated or no longer true.  

I don't know what to tell your Mom since she thinks it is true, but you can maybe make up shit saying that they were infiltrated with a Chinese virus that only kills Chinese people. Definitely a lie but telling her it's not true maybe too confrontational - or perhaps that we have TRUE PATRIOTS stopping them and Trump would never let that happen and to trust the plan."
politics,Florida requires 7 years of residency to run for State Senate. It's apparent she's lived in DC for the past 4. So nothing will happen soon.
Qult_Headquarters,"Good point - though it's really sickening that if there was a Spy involved with anyone in the HOuse or Senate that the reaction isn't ""shit is real.. let's huddle and figure this out"" it's this partisan attack of ""he's compromised, get the bastard off that committee"".  

I'm skeptical that Biden who thinks he can get people to be more bipartisan and bilateral is just a joke.  It may have been true in the past though we now have a beehive mind that is fed with Newsmax and OAN disinformation with 24/7 social media feeding."
Qult_Headquarters,"They never admit anything didn't work out. They either simply change the goal post; repeating something only with a slight variance or disqualifier; out right denial that what they tweeted/said was misunderstood, ignore it and move on to something else. 

Last night when the last 2 Kraken cases were denied and again, with scathing opinions in the orders, nothing. The narrative was all Swawell should be kicked off the House Intell Committee due to the Chinese Spy Lady even though Nunes was involved with Russia, Ukraine and how many were with Maria Butina socially? 

It's perpetual outrage, constant drama, and bullshit.  And god the whole ""what do you think it is?/what's going on here?"" type questions when it's like a photograph of an empty box in a random place."
slowcooking,"a twist on this is white chicken chili which is pretty much the recipe OP listed only with cream cheese which makes it more 'dippier'.   Highly suggest and big on pantry items.  Good for a snow day or just because days!

PoliticalHumor,"It's true.  Nunberg has been on MSNBC as a guest at times and indicated as such. He more or less snapped out of the Trump love when he got subpoenaed by Mueller about Roger Stone stuff and realized how cut throat the circle is.  He's still a conservative, a bit weird, but definitely not like the group Trump has around him now.  So he sometimes provides insight and 'translates' the bullshit."
politics,Seems it's a one way flight. I'm okay with that.
QAnonCasualties,"> Hypernormalization

I need to watch the videos people linked to but this seems spot on at a glance. 

>Adam Curtis explains how, at a time of confusing and inexplicable world events, politicians and the people they represent have retreated in to a damaging over-simplified version of what is happening.

That's the IMDB description and that's exactly what's happening.  In Qanon Twitter there are all these ""simple answers"" as to this election bullshit when election and voting laws are very complicated.  

Even with the dates to the Safe Harbor for Electors (tomorrow, 8 December) and the day of Electors voting, 14 December the talking point is ""They arent solid dates because they aren't in the CONSTITUTION! READ IT"" 

Uh, yea, and it gives the power to Congress to set the dates and they are in United States Code, which is the Federal Laws.   

This oversimplification and disregarding that things can be complex get dismissed so fast - not even an effort. 

Even this morning I'm seeing an article about the AZ legislatures who shut down the BUILDING to self isolate due to Rudy Giuliani's recent contact with a Committee that people are tweeting or retweeting asking ""Don't they have Zoom!!!!?"" 

Yea, second paragraph, a standing sentence states that the legislators and staff will work and conduct meetings remotely. 

Like for fucks sake.  Read the article.  Tihs happens so often - not even reading the articles they link to which is not what their hyperbolic comments reflect and in some cases, opposite."
politics,"Yet that also causes the legislators he met at to quarantine for 2 weeks and anyone they came in contact with.  That's pretty extreme for a party that doesn't take COVID seriously and puts a big challenge in their hopes of trying to get Article 2 Sec 1 plan XYZ to overturn the certifications at risk. Not that any of these Governors, Lt Governors or Secretaries of State/Commonwealths were entertaining the idea anyway."
politics,Outlets are confirming that he did test positive.
politics,"I think it's likely true and confirmed on MSNBC through their sources. Seeing how many people Rudy has been around, those people need to quarantine -which he was in 4 states, met with hundreds of 'witnesses' and in the hearings with state legislators.   I think it was the easiest way to inform a bunch of people, those he had direct contact, around and those around them. Like literally, hundreds of people."
politics,"76 and obese, so he's prone to comorbitities."
politics,"No. You're confusing him with the other 48 or more people in the WH orbit who got COVID.  His Son, Andrew Guiliani got it from the Election Night Party and works in the WH though.

ETA: I recall that Rudy was doing a precautionary self isolation but decided the election fraud was too important and decided to do his road show with Jenna."
politics,"It's also illegal.  Federal code set by Congress which is in Article II Section 1 of the Constitution, which the alt right groups keep waving around, dictates that the election needs to be on the same day in the entire nation, the date set by Congress.  The date set by Congress is the Tuesday after the First Monday in November. 

So one state cannot hold a separate election and shows how much bad legal advice Trump is getting from Rudy, Jenna and any other people around him.  Not that he'd listen or comprehend if someone showed him an infographic explaining this."
Qult_Headquarters,"I had a very interesting exchange on Twitter with a Qanoner about the Martial Law shit.  I asked how or why Martial Law was needed as there's specific criteria to be met, one being rebellion as in mass rebellion.  ""Yea! That's why Trump needs to do it. NOW!"" 

I asked where the mass rebellion was. ""You'll see it! The Storm is coming!"" Which I countered with ""well, it's not here yet.   Who are the people that will be doing the storm? will it be Trump supporters that will be storming?""  ""YEa, we have to take to the streets and ARREST these corrupt communist democrats and judges!"" 

Which I asked ""So doesn't that mean Martial Law is going to have the Military come after you for your civilian rebellion against these government officials?"" 

Blocked."
Qult_Headquarters,"Did they also do the ""the evidence is SECRET! Sidney can't show the evidence because only the JUDGE can see it!""  Yet there's also the ""How can they lose in court? Did you SEE the MOUNTAINS of EVIDENCE!?""

Yet explaining to them that there is a discovery process in which evidence has to be available to both parties, sometimes a review of the evidence, and then it's cross-examined or can be thrown out or deemed meritless is ""But it's EVIDENCE"".   They think these are sealed legal cases and it's like ""no, they're publically available and you can read them in PDF"". 

The funny trend now is in the Kraken cases is the redacting of names though Kraken Team has the names above the redaction.  I assume the reason is they fear the same type of harassment they provide government officials, UPS drivers that they're doing in these affidavits."
PoliticalDiscussion,"I've been following this closer than I should.  There's a lot of things going on that overlap. 

The TLDR of all of this? THe ""don't vote"" is super loud noise caused by 4 actors not the party. 

Powell and Wood: They have the four ""Kraken"" cases in Federal Courts in GA, MI, WI and AZ.  So far these complaints are riddled with typos and procedural errors.  For instance, uploading one motion request in an online form that was submitted to the court entirely blank. It was filed for public record. 

Lin Wood put out to the Twitterverse two emergency draft orders with a stamp of the Judges signature, naturally pissing off the judge.  The request was to impound and/or investigate the Dominion voting machines in GA. Note their early voting starts on 14 December for the Senate run off. 

The complaints are copy pastas of each other. Some of the cases refer to locations or witnesses from others.  An ""expert"" witness claiming fraud in a county that does not exist. 

Regurgitating the same ""expert"" witnesses who seem to have military or federal agency backgrounds but nothing related to election anaylsis or knowledge.  Just a bunch of dudes who get datasets and one expert, a former Colonel, basing his entire theory from the time stamps from the NYT election live update charts. 

The affidavits in some states were reviewed by a state judge, I believe in MI, and deemed meritless, moot, irrelevant and that the witnesses were misinformed, and did not even attend the orientation provided which would have educated the group of witnesses as to what and how the process worked.   We're talking the level of ""The counter wouldn't let me talk to them. I was an observer"".   The instructions for an observer clearly indicates they only watch and do not communicate with the counters, for example. 

So basically for these Kraken cases, there's a whole lot of barking and not one instance of reporting actual fraud, mishandling or ballot or voting errors. It's all theory and in essence ""some guy read a manual and in theory these ballots could be manipulated by people in China and eliminate 6 million of them. For Biden only."" 

That is not an exaggeration. 

Keep in mind Powell and Wood are working ""Independently"" so they're being objective even though they're doing rallies, and Powell was on the Trump team, and Wood is a Trump fan girl. Both are consumers, spreaders and now creators of Q disinformation.

So, where does this overlap? 

Rudy and Jenna Ellis who is now the Trump legal team.  They've been doing their tours to PA, MI, GA and AZ to the state representatives where they can, literally. Sometimes in hotels and with a few select state assemblypeople since the state party leaders and speakers would not allow formally and/or out of session.  The State Senate ones just happened and they did not take kindly to being asked legitimate questions.

The witnesses have the same sort of complaints, usually long and drawn out like a break room rant and the 'expert witnesses', well, oh my... the same ones that are from the Kraken.   Also note, in some of these ""hearings"" Rudy was given the floor and presented his witnesses as if he was back in a court room. 

The reason for this is because he failed to get an evidentiary hearing in PA and Kraken case judges are unlikely to have the same shit show in their courtrooms and would mean that their witnesses could be cross examined and allow for their own expert witnesses.  You know, a fair trial and not a one side propaganda show. 

Sad thing is, anyone who pushed back on Rudy, his witnesses, the Qanon twitter accounts immediately would start looking the names and social media accounts of these people. In real time.  They don't wait to swarm and attack. 

The Rudy goal is to get people to rescind certifications and push for the whole faithless elector ""Article 2 Section 1"". 

The goal for both is to get these states to flip for Trump.  They may not be working together officially but this is the strategy. 

The one aspect I found interesting though is how little these legislators actually know about their own election laws though there was a strong awareness about this. I found some of these state reps saying ""we could have done this better and faster if we followed how xyz state processed theirs"".  Mainly that they could have allowed early processing of mail in ballots when it was known they'd be in mass numbers... the Republican reps stating this which was hopeful. 

So, why the whole ""Don't vote for Loeffler and Perdue""?  That's mostly Lin Wood.  The man is unbalanced.  In watching his Twitter he will go on Twitter rants on unrelated topics for hours on end.  Turns out in one rant in which a law suit from his former business partners came up and he said to look it up to see how fake their lies are. 

So, I did.  The lawsuit is based on how Wood (Wait for it) caused a disruptive work enviornment and impacted the company based on excessive emails, texts, and rants on nonsensical associations and/or highly religious preaching tones. 

Wood is calling for the whole ""Don't vote for them"" because they're not 'doing enough' for Trump. As US Senators, they cannot interfere with the GA state officials as 1. It's a conflict of Interest and a US Senate ethics issue as we are seeing with Lindsey Graham.  2. They have little to no power of what the State officials do so it's not their jurisdiction. 3. He favors Doug Collins who is one of the louder people in US Congress who is an avid Trump supporter.  4. He feels if they don't support Trump enough so they're not worthy.

The other reasons is that He feels that the Dominion machines will not provide a valid election. Missing the point that as a lawyer, he hasn't proven in a court that the election was NOT valid.  He also has a slew of ""experts"" that can find the fraud, so why not move eforward and then if in the Run off any irregularities, do another investigation and/or legal challenge, right? 

Wrong.  He'd rather allow the two US Senate seats go to the Democrats to punish the GOP for not fighting more for Trump so they aren't worth fighting to keep the seat and to suffer at the mercy of the 'communist' democrats. 

Does it make sense? No.  The man is not seeing it as a party issue, he sees it as a Trump issue.   Any one who comes out against his ""don't vote"" plan he's personally going after on Twitter claiming to block them, and now victimizing himself.  And the man has 700K followers on Twitter who are echoing these sentiments. 

It's not a political play. It's not a strategy for the party. It's four people trying to get something for Trump that is simply not going to happen - Trump will not be re-elected.  

ANd they're giving Trump who is not versed in how election work, how governments work, how judicial systems work, can't see the writing on the wall.  It's all ""POTUS"".  THe goal is to get to POTUS. 

Rudy in PA lost a Federal Appeal and that was his moment to submit to SCOTUS.  IT's been a couple weeks; time is running out as Safe Harbor day for Electoral College is on 8 December. But no SCOTUS submission -oh, turns out Rudy is not on the Supreme Court Bar. There is one person in the PA firm he's working with but still, no submission.  It's likely he knows that Alito would reject the case since the Federal judges have deemed that the case was out of jurisdiction, had no proof, evidence and lacking merit.  SCOTUS won't take a case that is basically lacking in merit. 

They will do anything to achieve this with little to no recourse. Though these Kraken cases may be enough for a Bar sanction as they are being handled so poorly. 

I dont have a conclusion and this is all still going on with drama unfolding every day and mostly nonsensical.   If anything the real message is there's players in Trump's orbit that need to be held to some level of legal consequences and/or get some professional help and out of the public light. 

I do also wish that social media would take more action on these rumors.  Items are tagged by officials, like Jenna, Trump and Rudy, but when there's a twitter storm from Ron Watkins, yes, the son of the 4chan/8khun site saying that votes were changed remotely by the Chinese communists for Biden because he read the Dominion users manual and is one of thse ""expert witnesses"" should also be removed. 

These Qanoners have been called ot action by Watkins and others on Twitter to talk locations with voting machines.  They're stalking UPS delivery trucks thinking a box of surplus and unused ballots and information packets are somehow committing felony for violating the chain of ballot handling.  

There are some calls to form a new MAGA party since they feel abandoned by the GOP, and if this is the case, it may benefit the GOP which they think are all now ""leftists"" and ""RINOs""."
PoliticalDiscussion,"Seems the DIA wasn't happy when he was the Director there either.  If anything he was a chaotic wreck and even had a video of how woman should dress professionally while still being 'attractive'. 

He worked a lot with General McChrystal with Iran and Iraq hostilities but seem to have gone off the conspiracy theory train too far.  Eventually McChrystal denounced Flynn publically after he was fired from the White House.  I recall listening to his denouncement and you could tell he was genuinely disturbed by it. 

Now that we know directly or indirectly how people lose family members to conspiracy theories it's understandable the sense of loss."
politics,"The case was unsealed meaning that the public could access it, as once unsealed it goes on the public record for anyone to see.  Hence the strong level of redactions which is to cover up any information related to an ongoing investigation of another party in the criminality and/or grand jury information, as I understand."
politics,"I read something today - I wish I would have bookmarked it or something.  I can't shake it.  It was most likely on Q-twitter in which there is so much anger at the GOP for not sticking up more for Trump in fighting the perceived fraud, that they feel that it's worth losing the Senate to PUNISH them.  You won't help Trump? We won't help you. 
That if the country goes to socialist-communist hell, it's because they brought it on themselves. 

This was also the message that Lin Wood managed to convey very strongly in a Trump turned preacher with a Georgian drawl that was in a way, captivating. Insane, off the charts? Yes.  But unlike many other people who have tried to ""Trump"" it up, like DeSantis, today he came off as the best runner up as far as to rally stage presence.     He had a tone and energy like a preacher, only using the tone, the speech rhythm with words of mostly politics peppered with religious overtones which is another appeal to Q's.  

IT's not about party loyalty now. It's about Trump's loyalty. They feel betrayed that a GOP Governor and Lt Governor in Georgia isn't flipping the state.  They cannot understand how Red Georgia has turned blue. That there is ""NO WAY"" Georgia turned blue!  Not really aware of how Stacey Abrams played a huge role in that along with some voter reforms. 

That the only one out there fighting for Trump is Rudy, Jenna, Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood.  Everyone else is just letting Biden ""Steal"" This election... they feel abandoned and so they'll abandon them. 

That sure, the goal should be to win the majority and it's literally down to these two seats to determine which party will win the Senate. But they feel they can win the majority back in 2022 and for 2 years to just let it all go to shit, or rather what their version of letting things go to shit is. 

That it will teach the GOP aka Republicans in Name Only since they aren't being as Trumpy as they want... that it's up to them to determine who can and will win by their vote or lack of voting. 

While this seems highly unconventional, weird, shitty, bombastic - whatever word you choose - it's about on point for this very vocal group that pretty much exists in social media, with the capability to spread shit like this through one tweet to 400-500K people instantly, and they just blindly cheer and retweet, like, comment - that it just spreads and goes viral. 

But it's also stupid. So stupid, outrageous, self-defeating, petty that it actually fits this new Q-MAGA brand of Trump Supporters.

THe most amazing thing that happened today in this fucking whirlwind of Trump shit (TRump's video, Rudy's Michigan hearing, this ""We the People, Stop the Steal"" rally?  [That the Trump War Room tweeted out a Brietbart article calling Lin Wood a DEMOCRAT.](https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1334347919219175424?s=20) And even supported a Pro-Choice advocacy group and candidates.... oh the horror! 

[The link straight to the article is here.](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/02/records-lin-wood-decades-voted-donated-democrats-including-barack-obama-david-perdues-2014-opponent/) If you normally do not read Breitbart, put the bias aside, this article is worth the read, even if it's the only BB article you ever read.  There's no other way to understand this little fucking civil war going on in MAGALand. 

The political and legal drama right now is definitely a glorious shit show worthy of being Trump's Finale of his one season run of ""The Apprentice: Special President Edition""."
Qult_Headquarters,"""The Generals"" are old batshit crazy retired ones that basically are creating conspiracy theories like McInearny and Flynn. 

These are not active duty generals and this amazes me because alt right conspiracy Q followers are so ""But the CONSTITUTION"" but hey, lets suspend part of it to literally use the military to just do some pretty unconstitutional shit in the name of an Act that doesn't apply to anything at the moment.  

BUT OH MY GOD.. COMMUNISTS ARE THE SPAWN OF THE DEVIL. 

Like using the military to patrol people isn't some how.. an infringement of rights?  I mean how does one read this, think wearing a mask is ""but muh rights, muh liberty"" and think THIS is okay.

They ARE the terrorism now.   And this shit about an ""oath of allegiance to our President""??? What a fucking load of bullshit.  It's to the Constitution."
politics,"FBI falls under the DOJ.  So Director Wray reports to AG Barr.  The FBI does the investigations of crimes, like detectives. The DOJ is the US Attorneys who prosecute."
politics,"Durham is a lifer in the DOJ and proir to Barr had a good reputation.  We don't know much about him, what his investigation will conclude.  At this point in the game, it's an eye for an eye.  If we start poking eyes out then we're going to have a DOJ with only one eye for several adminstrations.  

If he's fired, it should be for good cause, but he seems like a normal DOJ lifer.  No reason to McCabe him at this point.  The New AG or DepAG (if AG has to recuse if it's someone like Yates) can meet with Durham and review, just like Rosenstein did.

I don't think firing a SC is a good precedent especially with the protection in place.  I do agree to having redactions not related to any grand jury information removed from the Mueller report though."
politics,"They keep getting dismissed in court and deferred to county courts and to address with the county clerks, especially the stories of hearsay or double hearsay.   Issues like Bobby and Linda not getting along because he wanted MdD's for lunch and she wanted Subway, and then Bobby said mean vulgar things, is not going to impact how a voter intended to cast their ballot. 

The orders have been pretty scathing  - and by about 6 or more judges.  That's in the cases in which the Trump ally organizations or Trump campaign complaints that were not withdrawn voluntarily."
politics,"In any election there's going to be a minute percentage so he couldn't say all.  many of the conspiracy theories and rumors going on social media and Trump are promoting wide scale fraud and as a result the lawsuits asking for wide scale voter invalidation and trying to decertify the votes. 

Also I wouldn't be surprised if people are calling the FBI to report voter fraud because ""I read on twitter... "" calls to arrest people or demand investigations.   Qanoners tend to ""swarm"" when they feel there's a justice to be made or had.   They're not exactly idle or passive."
politics,"When you have a bunch of Qanon pepole going ape shit to stalk the Dominion voting machines in Georgia, Governors, SoS's, County Clerks, their families getting death threats, it may be a good time to try to shut down the crazy. 

I'm sure the FBI this past month has been creating and adding to a great many watch lists."
politics,I overlooked that obviousness.  My oversight was bad and now I should feel bad.
politics,"The whistle blowers are not really whistle blowers since they could have provided their grievances according to their instructions.  They aren't really harming an agency or body.   So they are more accurately disgruntled volunteers.    

Several cases in state and federal have deemed these occurances as not any valid or warranted reason to deny or overturn a ballot or vote.  That not being within the 6' distance for COVID safety has no impact on the merit or validity of a ballot. 

Also many of the judges are indicating clearly that these observation disuputes are not required by federal law and should be local issues, some cases not even state but county issues and addressed with the local county clerk. 

So I'd say pretty much very low on the scale.  Though I think with the level of passion people feel, it's been wise to give them a forum to vent and be heard out at these faux hearings and real hearings.  Just keep them out of the cases that are using as a vessel to try to segue into invalidating an entire states mail in ballots, which is what's happening.  ""Joe, Linda, David and Diana were all maltreated, yelled at, made fun of so we ask the court to invalidate 2 million votes."" is such bullshit."
politics,"Yes, these THEORIES are in the in the Kraken cases, but in all three complaints there is not one mention of a specific incident of actual proof of a vote being manipulated.  The several witnesses, exhibits, and so on are all basing their conclusions on speculation, conjucture and data set points that come from sources that they dont' fully identify.   It's conjecture. 

There's no specific case of ""Mary Jane Doe in Putnam County, Georgia in which it is verified that she intended and voted for x and her ballot print out came out Y, was brought to an onsite poll supervisor as did with persons x,y,z"".  

Then of course there's the one ""expert"" Ron Watkins whose testimony is based on reading a manual and watching videos.  These are great to show some level of possibility. 

But does not prove any of these theories were actually executed or even occurred. 

Bill Barr's comments today pretty much have indicated that some of these theories, especially that of Matt Braynard who openly stated he provided his research to the FBI is now easy to dismiss as being meritless. 

Again, it's about proving actual ""injury"" to voters, not that it's possible, likely, plausible, can be done in theory. 

I also did not see any references to the alien sexual acts in any three of the cases.  I feel cheated."
politics,He wasn't retired.  He was working for Kirkland and Ellis.
politics,"Considering that Rudy has been asking for an invalidation of the entire Commonwealth of PA of 6 Million people or absentee/mail in Ballots in PA, about 1.3 Million people, and Powell/Wood cases also trying to invalidate millions of votes in three states, this statement was geared more towards those allegations and claims."
politics,Trump has a history at these junctures in always picking the worst possible decision and/or one that wasn't remotely imaginable prior.
politics,"There are allegations but no real reports of actual fraud except two people both in PA.  They were both arrested. 

Early civil litigation that initially were filed for fraud, which has a high bar to meet in court, the cases were dismissed and walked back in court as the lawyers if they claimed and pursued fraud with evidence that did not meet the legal standard could be sanctioned or lose their license to practice.  So the allegations then turned into the claims of mistreatment of observers which mostly did not indicate any votes being effected, hearsay or without merit or relevancy."
politics,Not really.  Barr by his comments just eliminated the possibility of several active lawsuits and a dozen cases that could be appealed by stating there's no evidence of fraud or tampering of machines.  For three cases this was their entire argument.
politics,Normally it's the Deputy AG who becomes the Acting AG just as Sally Yates was when Trump took office. However Trump has also sidestepped that rule and put Whittaker in after Sessions was fired until Barr was confirmed by the Senate.
politics,Bill Barr is FBI/DOJ. Not CIA.
politics,"I think with several Secretaries of State stating they've received death threats and threats of violence, that he had to put a foot down with a public comment."
politics,I think all of them are true and can happen at the same time.
politics,"he's a consumer, spreader and generator of conspiracy theory. He also made a report on Hunter Biden, for example."
politics,Trump's been tweeting since the meeting. So I don't think anything happened.
politics,"I think the FBI may have gotten so many flags of reports of officials getting threats, the internet rhetoric escalating to incitement, people demanding arrests, etc that Barr realized it's gone too far.  Plus if the litigation keep escalating he'll have to have his US Attorneys in court having to debunk at some point since this has gotten so out of control."
politics,"One problem.  No actual proof or evidence of any of the items you listed has been provided. It's all rhetoric, theory and assumptions. 39 times, so far courts have ruled that allegations without evidence is meritless.

Though I admit the aliens engaging in taboo sexual acts is new. Will that be in a supplemental to one of the Kraken Cases?"
politics,"What i'm seeing on Qanon Twitter is pretty much focus on some sort of ""Whistleblower"" testimony of a mailman in Arlington VA of mishandling of ballots or something. I didn't watch the video and Trump tweeted it out...  so I guess Barr has a job.

Comments on Barr are mixed.  It's like the two button meme. 

Press left for: Barr should be fired; fraud did happen

Press right for: Honey Badger is amazing - he made Durham a Special Counsel and can't be fired"
politics,"I would not support Biden firing him. He's doing his job and now as a SC that means Biden firing him can be an issue, especially since he could be a party in the investigation.  

However, this means Barr is now in charge of Durham and also means whoever the next AG is also.   If Yates is the next AG she may have to recuse like Sessions did. 

But Durham doesn't seem to be a bad actor, he's following orders.  I mean that in the sense that we do not know what, if any, intentions he has other than investigating the investigators."
politics,"This is absolutely stunning news in the aspect it completely undermines the basis of the now the THREE Sidney Powell & Lin Wood ""Kraken"" cases based on Qanon Conspiracy Theories.   One ""expert"", Matt Braynard was bragging how the FBI asked for his reporting and research, thinking it would be to make arrests but now we know to debunk. Braynard yesterday stated by his ""mathematics"" about 1.3 Million votes are 'illegal'.  Then of course Rudy pushed to ask if it was feasible in a state like AZ with so many ""Illegal aliens"" if they could have voted illegally and that the count could be higher because of that demographic. (Oh Rudy!) 

The other massive blow out from this Barr comment is that it totally hinders the Rudy Guiliani/Jenna Ellis claims as the same ""expert witnesses"" for the Kraken cases are the same they've been using at the Dog and Pony Circus Tour with these fake hearings with State Senators in PA and AZ.  

Seeing the statement from Rudy and Jenna is special as they claim that Barr isn't familiar with the evidence they have. Yes, Jenna, they are.  Listen to your witnesses brag over and over how they were asked and gladly provided their research to the FBI.  Also, shame on you for implying an AG doesn't know what has been investigated when you can't even get a Four Seasons venue right. 

This comment from Barr also puts water on so many of the conspiracy theories: 

>He said people were confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits. He said such a remedy for those complaints would be a top-down audit conducted by state or local officials, not the U.S. Justice Department.

> “There’s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don’t like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and ‘investigate,’” Barr said.
> 
> He said first of all there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate.

As there is a theme that people are going to get arrested for the fraud, not people like the Forty Fort, PA guy, but like Biden, Governors, Secretaries of State going to be arrested for the illegal laws they made (which each state passed through their legislative bodies). 

This also means it puts a big huge wall to Rudy's path to SCOTUS even though the PA case if it was to go to SCOTUS probably wouldn't hold up. 

For the Kraken case, this timing is perfect.  The Kraken in GA was pushing to impound ALL Dominoion voting machines in GA citing manipulation, even though the early voting is to start in GA soon.  They did get an emergency order for 3 county machines to be 'investigated' but it's hard to know exactly the status since Lin Wood put into the Qtwitterverse several unofficial drafts of opinions and it's been changing almost everyday."
Qult_Headquarters,"Craigslist???  Do I want to know? 

This kinda is the jist of it.  Has a General, Alphabet soup, secret election servers... 

I swear they'll believe anything from anyone ""General"" in their name.  If anything watching Flynn being vocal again on Twitter just validates why he was booted off the friggen DIA and out of the Army.

Qult_Headquarters,"I still laugh when I see these ""To understand Trump, you need to read the Art of War.  He's a tactical genius!""   

No.  No, no he's not.  He would never read the book or even understand it."
Qult_Headquarters,Its now mostly election fraud.  Seems the whole save the children was dropped due to TOS violations etc.
Qult_Headquarters,"The whole Qummunity is so bizarre.  I kinda ge the LARPing military style of some of these super spreader on Twitter - the toxic masculinity. 

But man, the older (50+) church ladies are... wow.  The level of dismissing anything that may be informative (even when told in a polite or neutral manner) to the amount of insant ad hominem personal attacks is.... they'd not do well on Reddit. 

The amount of outrage, hate, dismay, before really learning anything is like the perpetual wheel.  They thrive on the hate and energy - and in this sub, it's so sad to see this overflowing into personal lives."
Qult_Headquarters,"Or I dunno... Secretaries of State and County Clerks are now uploading our election results abroad because...??? 

Based on what happened in the Iowa Caucus app Failure, that County Clerks are both bumbling and major international cyber experts transferring data on super-duper secret back channels."
Qult_Headquarters,"I'm still stuck on when the DIA was removed under the DoD umbrella and that this seems to be a friendly fire situation in which measures, extreme measures are usually taken to avoid. 

I just am perplexed if this is just people trolling or that stupid."
law,"That's correct.  So the talking point being parroted in the Q-Community is that people were blindsided in GA and that's why the hand count audit/recount didn't show any discrepancies or variances - that ""of course the recount didn't prove fraud- the paper ballots were reflecting the altered vote since it happened in the software"". 

So again, the lack of proof of fraud actually occurring IS the proof that the fraud happened.  

I wish was kidding and just a comment or isolated user - but the Q-community, if one says it, they all do hence why their motto of WWG1WAG is true, just not in the way they intend.  Powell and Lin Wood is basically just giving a voice to this collective vault of disinformation.  

And only happened in these keystates Trump knew he had to win for his very narrow path to 270 that he yelled and touted in rallies and twitter ""If I get PA, I have them ALL and I win!""  is so damned transparent 

Just like both of Powell's arguments only indicate ""fraud COULD happen, and here's a bunch of things from the internet that says it can"" and not any ***actual*** fraud that happened."
law,"It's amazing to me that the avid Trump supporters/Qanon who seem to be LARPs of being some sort of group of warriors taking oaths, being digital warriors, and having a military fetish, fail to realize how poor Trump's relationship with the Military is. They are blinded by their own false patriotism and bite into Trump's marketing brand that the military is about ""super-duper rocket missles"" and air shows. 

It took nearly 2 years for Trump to go abroad to visit the Troops, whereas it took Obama about 4 months.  

The first day literally in office he disparaged the CIA memorial at his rant about his inauguration crowd size.  This year alone the reports of calling them ""losers and suckers"", trying to use the Military as crowd control and attempting to use them further under the Insurrection Act, the poor handling of COVID on Naval vessels, reports he was going to fire Esper prior to the election, etc.  

So it's a bit surprising ""why would AD Military not vote for me?"" being a shock. Especially with consideration when the other candidate has a long history of respecting the Military and his own son who died decided to serve the country. 

I think the other variance is the votes are not just for a President, but their own CIC and boss.  It's not unfair to think that the chaos management style has worn thin as they are directly impacted by policy."
law,"Thank you - the Trump Twitter supporters are floating out there that the paper ballots changed the votes in real time and didn't get to review the print out, so voters never knew or could know their votes were altered.  

Like if a person selected Trump, the print out would indicate Biden, and the voter wouldn't know at all."
politics,"I was able to capture some of this too.  I have to say there is an advantage of being in a ""Zoom"" environment now.   I've been keeping tabs on some of the other cases.  It's a surprise to me that she's including this information in general seeing how other cases have ruled on these observation witnesses in several states. 

Though in the same regard I'm not surprised either."
law,"Also those who are conservatives, Qanon supporters, Trump supporter - whatever name you choose, they've already heard and seen these arguments, accusations and 'proof' which is in the exhibits.  They have been making the Twitter and Facebook rounds and being told in the gorrilla media of ""independent journalists"" that have thier own 'news sites' which are just blogs, repeating this stuff as news because ""MSM"" won't tell these stories.

In Trump's time, these lawsuits that pose new information to us have already been trending on social media for about 2 weeks or so.  This was apparent during the debates with Biden and Trump. 

MSM doesn't tell these stories because it's internet bullshit with little to no credibility, easily debunked or just outrageously bullshit based on conjecture.  

With these two lawsuits, the difference is that Trump, who doesn't really have the ability to do critical thinking, and his 2016 campaign pushed disinformation in which Mueller even admitted Junior didn't get charged because he engaged 'unknowingly' with the Russians with the pushing of conspiracy stuff made by the IRA. 

So it's a weird cycle. Trump touts ""Rigged"" and absentee is okay, mail-in ballots are fraud, you can vote twice (curing but he presented a method which is voting by mail and in-person), Trump has USPS-PMG delay or slow mail to try to delay mail being on time, and then the social media supporters believe it.  

Trumps whole overt attack on mail-in and absentee voting causes for people to vote early, by mail due to the pandemic while GOP and his supporters voted in person on Tuesday, 3 November causing the ""Red mirage"" that even Jim Jordan revealed in the House hearing with DeJoy (Trump will look like he won on election night but having mail in votes will cause for the tallies to change and that's cheating)...

So then the trump supporters see this wave that was ""predicted"" an already labeled and branded as cheating...so they dig into their little bubbles of theorizing how the cheating happened, and then people like Powell and Lin Wood (another lawyer on the case who just got slammed down in his own solo suit asking for 1M votes to be invalidated in GA) and then they pass it back on to Trump 

Trump whines and brands> SUpporters believe him and 'research'> Trump sees this 'research' and it validates his own version of reality. 

THen throw in these other 'media' outlets of independent media 'journalists"" and OAN, Newsmax and it's a full sort of terrarium.  

Other added ingredients are Qsupporting sons like Eric and especially JUnior promoting this idealogy of Trump Army, which the Qanons love as they consider themselves ""Digital Warriors"" for Trump and pushing their narrative to 'red pill' others.  Trump isn't politics, it's an idealogy. 

They can't handle if Trump loses since he's always fighting, winning or a victim of 'hoaxes' like the Impeachment.  Which...was caused by Rudy and John Solomon who made Ukraine shit up. 

Well, that was a wall of text, but glad to have typerveniliated.  I've thrown myself into the Trump social media world and it's...  a very dark place."
politics,"Thank you for that clarification.  

This is the order that addressed the sticky note and other allegations argued by the Trump Campaign.  Being 3:30 AM I am a little slow, though I'm surprised there was no indication or reference in Sidney's complaint to this case. At all.  

https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/20201106-Opin-and-Ord.pdf"
politics,"I'm seeing legal Twitter saying she's risking getting serious reprimand for: 

Rule 9
>Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters
> 
> (a) Capacity or Authority to Sue; Legal Existence.
> 
> (1) In General. Except when required to show that the court has jurisdiction, a pleading need not allege:
> 
> (A) a party's capacity to sue or be sued;
> 
> (B) a party's authority to sue or be sued in a representative capacity; or
> 
> (C) the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party.
> 
> (2) Raising Those Issues. To raise any of those issues, a party must do so by a specific denial, which must state any supporting facts that are peculiarly within the party's knowledge.
> 
> (b) Fraud or Mistake; Conditions of Mind. ***In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.*** Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.


And Rule 11: 

>(b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:

> (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;

> (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;
> 
> (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and
> 
> (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.

This is why when the early lawsuits were having oral arguments lawyers for GOP/Trump were walking back when Judges pressed if they were alleging fraud. 

Sidney is pretty much saying ""hold my beer, my purse, my cell phone and I'm going to take my heels of"" ready to go full speed into a wall."
politics,"Many of the affidavits in her Michigan complaint were in a separate state lawsuit in Michigan which were debunked and deemed moot and primarily misunderstandings, hearsay, or not relevant.  Four people didn't attend the orientation in which the process was clearly explained, what station was to do what, nor did these observers bring to attention to supervisors in real time. 

Sidney didn't indicate these affidavits were previously submitted and the final order from that hearing and case. 

Also, Sidney had a website with an online form pretty much asking anyone with any information to submit claims, much like the Eric Trump fraud hotline.  Seems instead of having proof of wrongdoing, she's insisting wrongdoing was done and scrambled to find anything to fit the narrative to help support the other rampant qanon theories"
Qult_Headquarters,As if a legal case that was attempting to completely change the election or just a state's final tally wasn't gong to be covered.  The whole point is to make a landmark case - to win.  Not for media coverage unless... oh that's right. Court of public opinion!!
politics,"I picture him just asking and blaming people ""How could this happen? Why did you let this happen?!""

Mind you he dropped in approval polls after the 1 June attack on protesters using secret federal agents.  He ignored COVID.  He abandoned people in the cold and heat at his rallies, the RNC convention was lackluster and even surreal at times. He put in Dejoy to slow the mail while touting lies about mail in voting.  They changed the RNC venue several times, the campaign manager is alleged to $40M from the campaign funds.

I dunno what could have gone wrong?!"

politics,Georgia already certified.  I don't think it's fair to Georgia for their taxpayers to spend the money and time to entertain Trump.
politics,"It just seems redundant, unnecessary, desperate, and waste of time, money, and resources.  It's at the cost of GA and there's not really any reason for a third recount or a reconciliation of signatures.  The signature verification is a two-step process and has a method that is fair and can involve up to half a dozen people for one signature."
politics,"Seems the focus is now on the signatures on the ballots which are checked when someone requests a mail-in ballot and again when it is received.  Then once the signature is verified (or not) the ballot is removed and separated as GA has a private voting law. 

So even if there are some signatures that may be deemed unverified, it's not going to be many and there is literally no way to know what candidates they voted for.

I would not be surprised if this request is denied as it just seems to be for theatrics and not for any valid reason or injury."

politics,"Trump keeps thinking Rudy is the Rudy in the 70's and 80's.   Both Rudy and Trump seem to be likeminded and don't realize that they are both... out of their rightful minds and just making seriously horrible and bad decisions.

This opinion even goes into it as well as the Defendants lawyers went into in good detail in oral arguments, that the PA laws allowed counties the discretion to allow curing or not. 

THe counties that did not do or offer curing of ballots were Red counties.  So in a way, they played themselves by being so strict and making it more likely to not count ballots for disqualification, they instead took away votes for Trump.

Opps."

Though in coming across what she feels is evidence is from an affadavit from a witness who started with ""of sound and strong mine"" (not mind), that the affidavit indicates this witness back in the day during an election for Chavez that he heard that the election machines were Dominion and were altered to make Chafez look like he won.

So Trump's proof of massive fraud is that these two heavily Democratic counties.. voted for the Democratic candidate.

politics,"Love how this was done to ensure that there's no issue with the Certification, which is on Monday, 23 November for PA and MI


https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-election-results-trump-biden.html
>Monday is the deadline for counties in Pennsylvania to certify their totals and send them to Kathy Boockvar, the secretary of the commonwealth, who will certify the state results. Pennsylvania doesn’t have a hard deadline for when Ms. Boockvar must sign off, but there is no reason to expect a delay.

Same with MI

Despite Republican protests over the certification of results in Wayne County, which includes Detroit, the state is expected to certify on time."
politics,"The current count of 2020 Election litigation is 2 W to 34 L.   

One of the wins was more or less the Trump campaign asking that the PA ballot processing require the separation of the ones received from 4 to 6 November be set aside and counted separately which PA county clerks were already doing. 

Also, not 28 Judges, as many of these cases are being filed in counties or federal districts that have the same judge. One is a Trump appointee so, that's also pretty much an indicator that these cases are just failing.  Many of them are almost the same just different 'witnesses' with bullshit stories that are deemed meritless. 

Waste of time and money, honestly."
politics,"Yes, she's definitely not credible. Though the fact she's using Q based theories as her legal argument is concerning in the aspect she's not only making this disinformation and misinformation into national attention, these followers are totally backing her.  They even went after Tucker hard when he was skeptical of her due to lack of any evidence. 

If she does file anything, it will lose.  Then the next attack will be on the integrity of the court system.  So this demographic of people already running on emotions, ideas, and disinformation are going to be even more fueled that Biden ""stole"" this election."
politics,"This has been litigated in several cases with different opinions from judges.  Last was with Trump tweeting out that he declassified ALL Russian related information which, well would be bad for national security and even himself in the Mueller report.  Mark Meadows had to appear on Trumps behalf to insist it wasn't an order but just commentary. 

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/20/mark-meadows-trump-declassification-russia-430316 

>A pair of tweets President Donald Trump sent earlier this month complaining about the slow pace of the release of information about the origins of the Russia investigation did not amount to a direct order to make public any additional information, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows declared in an unusual court filing Tuesday.

....

>“I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax. Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!” Trump wrote on Twitter two weeks ago. “All Russia Hoax Scandal information was Declassified by me long ago. Unfortunately for our Country, people have acted very slowly, especially since it is perhaps the biggest political crime in the history of our Country. Act!!!”

Edit to add: This article is from 20 October, so a month ago.   It feels like it was 3-4 months ago.  I want my sense of time back, please. 

Trump is literally the nightmare of any leader anyone could ever imagine.  Half this Administration is walking shit back or putting in hours of work for something to be changed or moot at a moment's notice if not overtly ignored, and general elephant scooping."

politics,"I'm following the Sidney stuff and I don't know why.  She told Maria Bartiromo that her most impressive evidence is some Military or DoD person knows how the possibility of coding the Dominion machines can be done.  Not that it was done, but that it can be done.   

Why the DoD and not say, the DHS, CISA would be her strongest peice of evidence, I have no idea why.  She's gotten her leads from the internet like twitter and a trump supporter post forum, and is scraping up 'hundreds of affidavits"" though if they are anything like what has been submitted in several (dozens?) of other lawsuits, they hold no merit.  The affidavits especiall in Detriot were deemed meritless or inadmissible since the witnesses either were speculating, reporting hearsay or simply uneducated and did not attend the orientation to explain the document processing stages and what each station was doing in the assembly line. 

It should also be noted I don't think it's a coincidence Rudy and Powell had their presser on the same day they hoped to have an evidentiary hearing in the federal PA case that the judge canceled and the case was denied. 

At this rate, Powell has exposed herself to many right wing media outlets such as Newsmax, Fox, OANN, Glenn Beck, many asking her ""whats the evidence"" and she in a very Trumpian manner keeps saying ""you'll see"".  Seems she's making an allegation before she can prove there was any actual evidence that these Dominion voting machines were somehow utilized to change votes. 

I think I'm watching because it's such a train wreck and she's just setting herself up, and her supporters up, for a major humiliation while ruining the integrity of our elections - at a time they need to win the GA senate run off election. 

I also remind she's the lawyer for General Flynn in his case which is ongoing since he pled guilty, rescinded, then the DOJ got involved.. blah blah blah and Flynn is a huge Q Anon supporter. I wouldn't be surprised if he's a major influence on her with this basically shitty information."

The rest were claims that the ballot processing was not transparent (it was) and were denied or wtihdrawn for being meritless. 

So now the next on the list is Rudy and Sidney Powell coming up with conspiracy theories to prove that the machines used are somehow programmed by the left.   There's a lot of barking but nothing provided to any courts yet."
politics,They need his base for the Georgia Senate Race.  Loeffler has associated herself with the recently elected Qanon candidate and they need both Senate candidates in GA to win to get House Majority.
politics,"Short answer, yes. 

Long answer is Trump has always said for years, going back to 2015 with the Primaries and Caucuses being rigged whenever he wasn't the winner.  Then said the same thing about Hillary, then in midterms in GOP campaigns in Congress, and again this election that the system is ""rigged"". 

Trump and other top GOP people like Graham have said on record that they know if more people vote, the more likely the GOP would lose.   

Now, there's two things at play this election - COVID and a lot of states have changed their voting laws prior to COVID, such as PA and VA due to new state leadership and assemblies (state version of house of reps and senate).   More states have rid of GOP laws that made it very difficult to vote, requiring limited ID, difficult absentee/mail in voting.  So with COVID a lot of states modified to allow people to vote by mail for safety. 

This pissed off Trump as he knows it was a threat to his incumbancy and then he installed a new Post Master General who immediately started to slow down the mail, removing machines to help expedite the processing of mail, to slow down the election process.  This pissed a lot of leaders off as with that goes checks, medicines, etc.  

So then people were like ""shit, we can't trust mail"" but many of these states who changed laws as a revision or due to COVID also allowed early in person voting and mail drop boxes.  

Texas knew that due to changing demographics that the state could swing for the first time in decades, so Governor Abbott limited the number of ballot drop off boxes to one per county.  One county with a major city had one box for 4.7 million people, this was challenged. 

SO the whole time, Trump and many GOP people were saying that the mail in ballots would be ""Fraudulent"" because come election day, it would show Trump was the winner when the mail in ballots needed to be counted, and that Trump would be the winner on election night but would ""lose"" because of the mail in ballots.  

Mind you GOP in states pushed for the delayed ballot processing... if PA GOP didn't push for that, we would have seen the PA Biden lead before the election. But the reason to force states to process mail in ballots was to make Trump seem like he was winning and an attempt to make them be disqualified, which the courts have been saying ""hahaha, no. The ballots and votes are valid"". 

So this was called the ""red mirage"" since most GOP people voted in person on Election Day, 3 November.  The states still being watched took a long time time to process due to the sheer volume due to COVID, but all are within their own state deadlines and going accordingly. 

So there is no 'fraud' but as often done, TRump will say something untrue and based on nothing other than his own fear and speculation (and often misunderstanding) then there's a scramble to show he was in fact correct. 

Also, Trump always cheats, at everything. So he also thinks that people are like him and also cheat. He does not understand that people will and do play by the rules since to him, rules don't apply to him.  

It's a mess and hard to understand why he thinks anything he does. But thre is no fraud and so far of 25 cases, Trump's campaign won one in PA, and was to enforce a process that PA was already in compliance with. So the one case won for Trump was just more or less for nothing."

Mind you Rudy's bullshit is now focused on a conspiracy theory by some guy on Twitter and that Rudy's disinformation is going to 1 Million of his followers. 

I really wish that Twitter and Facebook would just delete these accounts with 100K followers or more that are spreading overt disinformation. 

The people most deep seem to be middle aged or older women who just don't really know how to weed through internet bullshit.

It's frustrating to see these accounts still saying Trump can and will win, when he has no chance.  The ""large amounts of evidence"" are pretty much what one would expect that was gathered together and thrown at the court without really checkign the validity of the claims and the legal merit.  So they keep losing cases. 

Even then, we're talking about 500 or so challenged ballots in several states where Biden leads in over 10K votes.  So a few hundred isn't going to flip enough states to hit 270.  

The false hope is what upsets me.  These people in denial are getting validation of a truth that doesn't exist and will make it harder to cope with when they see Joe being sworn in."
politics,"yea, the whole ""4-D Chess"" to me never was plausible.  Like you said, it implies strategic thinking.  He's not strategic, or not intentionally. He runs on instinct only - he knows if he says things, people get pissed.

politics,"I don't think Trump does it to distract the media. I think it's a way of not coping with difficult situations, topics.  Like that's his personal defense mechanism because he doesn't really have many emotions. Rage, chaos, anger, seem to be the only emotions he feels on a scale. 

Like when he does it, I feel it's his brain shouting squirrel because he just can't handle whatever it is.  He can't process, he's not really a critical thinker - so he just reacts."

Also early in the DHS program there was no tracking methods being made to reunite the children to the parents.  Some of these children are/were infants at the time of the separation so they don't have any information to provide as an older child or teen could provide. 

Which by the way, the DHS had one executive level who made spreadsheet to track the periods of all the female minors which is extremely uncalled for.

politics,"I said I'm undecided.  I'm not for or against.  While I think it would be wise to balance the court system out, and I am so well aware of the wrongs done - 1. Denying Obama of Garland; 2. Going ""nuclear"" with Gorsuch to get him through. 3. Not allowing more time to investigate Kavanaugh's possible perjury; 4. Changing the rules to rush through Barrett ***during*** an election. 

I'm not saying any of this is okay.   I also know part of the problem is there's no recourse to McConnell for the amount of unilateral power he has and can violate the Constitution. 

However, it seems there is now what is a politicization of the one branch not meant to become a partisan playground.   I also haven't seen a scenario that wouldn't come back to haunt. 

The GOP packed, so now the Dems pack, and if GOP gains control again, it gets packed again... 

Also there's no guarantee that the Senate will flip to Democrat majority and if it does, not a super majority of 60.  So it's not likely that such an amendment has an actual chance of being passed, in my opinion.  Of course, also contingent if Biden wins. 

This is why I think Biden has proposed the idea of a bipartisan committee to review.  It seems if there was going to be a restructuring of Article III via an amendment, the process should include something as balanced and fair as possible.   Like considering a nomination limitation (2 per term for example). 

And then there's the issue, if there is support - how many is fair? Is it based on ""one jurist per district"" to 13?  Or go something like Buttigeg proposed which is more complicated that there be a total of 10 appointed and they choose 5... adding a whole new level to Article III and opening more partisanship internally to the SC?

I need more information before I can be on or off board for the SC.

ETA:  I am on board for the Senate to review their Rules and also have some sort of way for a Senate Majority Leader who has total control over the floor to have some sort of an appeal process.   What enabled the obstruction of OBama's vacancies, nominees (jurists, PLUM and cabinets) was all due to the Senate Majority leader unilaterally saying ""Nope I don't want to do this"" and same goes for the House bills that Mitch is sitting on.   that's the essence of all these evils..one person in the upper chamber who can go without recourse or even be formally challenged."
politics,"I'm undecided on the SCOTUS packing of jurists. 

HOwever, I do wonder about unpacking the Federal level jurists (judges) that were run through this Administration that were deemed unqualified and consider impeaching them.   Going to SCOTUS takes a lot of money, time, and a strong case.  Most don't push that far and not always a guarantee the SC will take a case. 

But to me while Barrett being approved - is a high concern, I still have concerns as to the McConnell packing which started in the Obama Administration handing Trump a huge present of open vacancies."

I can tell you she is NOT all there.  I did follow her closely in 2017-about this summer.   The closest she came to getting help was when after postponing her cyst removals by trying homeopathic means (grape fast diet, fasting, etc) and they did not only fail to shrink, they grew much larger and the reason she had to have a full hysterectomy. 

During that time she also managed to push herself into getting into a food disorder treatment, the whole ""I ate a block of cheese meltdown"" citing she was hopeless which is the precise wording to cause for an emergency - then failed to listen to the doctors (a team of several specialists) who also put her on mood stabilizers - which she couldn't figue out a fucking routine time to take them and just quit cold turkey.  Meds that one needs to be tapered from and she of course flipped the fuck out. 

So seeing that she couldn't get her self together with a team of people, can't take any meds on a routine level, which her brain will still do inner negotatoins with, failure to accept responsibility, over 300 pounds overweight, and can't figure out what ""Fair Use Act"" is after several eposiodes of channel strikes and being told if she wants to truly go after someone for Copyright infrigement she'll not only need a lawyer, she needs an international one since she's in Canada and most reaction channel creators are in the US.

Then they tune in to the First debate and just turned that stuff off.  In 2016 the campaign team (Priebus, Bannon, Kellyanne) managed to get Trump to stay off Twitter last 10 days.  That would be a blessing now.  

He's done this to himself."
politics,"I am skeptical.  The issue with Hillary's email October situation was that the emails were related to an already ongoing investigation with her server usage and then the 33,000 emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner who her Exec Assistant, Huma Abedin, was married to.    

The update of the new emails found on a separate device through another FBI investigation (Weiner having internet comms with an underage female with pics) had to be reported to the House Oversight Chair, Jason Chaffetz, who tweeted about it.   That's when the public lost their minds.

I remember vividly that it was likely the 33,000 emails found on Abedin's/Weiner laptop were already sorted through and they were - they were just duplicates of the same emails and nothing new was discovered.  But didn't matter - the damage was done. 

The other aspect is the FBI is already supposedly investigating the laptops and nothing that seems credible for Director Wray to waste his resources on.  

I also think Barr knows that if Trump keeps pushing for 'anything' to be prosecuted, the Biden lawyers can simply state the charges are not bonafide and just a political attack and abuse of power.  

What will be interesting is if Trump loses the election, the FBI - DOJ looks into the criminal activity of himself or adult children, how that will play out since the only political power he will have if he loses may be Twitter."

PoliticalDiscussion,"In living through all of these as a young adult to now middle aged person - I think these scandals are a bit reflective of the change of views of my generation. 

The Boomer generation, my and our generations parents grew up in a 'traditional' sort of upbringing, the whole mom, dad, 2 kids, white picket fence ideology.   Infidelity did exist but turned the other cheek to it since women were dependent on men; women did not have many rights or career options and divorce was rare and only for those in Hollywood. 

Then comes the 70's and suddenly women had more work opportunities (still limited and with challenges) but more self sufficient and divorces became more common - usually as a result of infidelities. 

So by the time Gary Hart, Clinton scandals came about there was a level of understanding these issues as human ones. Personality flaws not exactly directly tied into being leaders or their ability to govern.  

The evolution over the decades has been a more open minded generation saying ""I don't care who they have sex with"" and politicians realizing their entire approach of being ""highly morale"" can lead into hypocrisy. 

Other cultural shifts also happened in the 90's.  For instance, take Eminem who shook the country up. A white guy from Detriot doing rap in a manner that was unique, appealed to middle class white teens? Wish shocking and offensive lyrics?  To the point that OMG the Vice President's wife was clutching pearls and then Congress got involved and resulted in the music ratings? 

That was Tipper Gore.  The wife of Al Gore.  Democrats, not conservative Republicans.  Yet that was pretty much the whole cookie cutter politician lifestyle of being a bit too pious and moral. Our generation saw through that shit too. 

Sure even to this day, there's some ""well if s/he can lie and cheat to their family, they'll do it to the public"".  Perhaps, but it's hard to say that hiding an affair from a spouse is an equivalent of an elected official's relationship to constituents.   

Partisanship definitely was a star lead role for Clinton and what started as an investigation into Whitewater issues; and turned into the Monica Lewinsky investigation once Paula Jones civil case was determined to legally continue.. and well, Linda Tripp.... but these affairs turned into a weapon.

Now we have Trump, with his known infidelities of his wives, 25 or so more women claiming sexual assault or more, and nothing. 

Though it seems that any sort of crack in a candidate will still be used as venue to attack a political opponent. 

I also think that these general affairs, are not as shocking or fill people with anger as much as these sexual abuse cases such as we've seen with elected officials not reporting sexual abuse in former jobs, or former representatives abusing pages while sponsoring bills against pedophiles.

Though I think we're still evolving as Monica Lewinsky at 22 when she was an intern, her entire adult life impacted by the scandal via victim shaming, the jokes.  We now realize that it wasn't the lying that was such an issue, but a workplace harassment and abuse of power.  

I'm old enough to have also witnessed how executives have taken advantage of, harassed or discriminated against young adults when they intern overtly and covertly.  It's a relief to see the intolerance for the objectification or abusing interns in doing work, errands or favors not related to their work program. 

As to how voters should think about ""moral failings""? That's too personal to give a blanket general response other than it's up to each person to make their own determination.   People are human, and to me the question is ""will this affect how they will perform their duties?""

Cunningham, no I don't think it should matter.  To Trump, yes because of the voluminous allegations and without any sort of investigation which could in his position cause for him being compromised. 

Which is another issue - when having a security clearance having anything that could be used against a person for extortion or blackmail, though that's not on the front of the minds of most voters."

politics,"2020 is full of exceptions.  While I don't think it was a good idea, Trump shit all over the network earlier - but seeing the bits I did of his town hall, he took another public moment to come off as a pretty hostile rambling man with no specifics, details or knowledge."
politics,I popped in during the Biden breaks too... the energy with Biden is so calm and informative.  Trump is like verbally kicking sand castles repeating the same whiny stuff.
politics,"Trump's explanation was ""it was a retweet, it doesn't mean anything, I like retweeted"" which is what he's said in the past when he's slammed for a shitty retweet because he has no idea of what he's doing, the implications or if there's any truth to anything.  

HIs mindset is stuck on ""hurt the libs and hurt Joe Biden"""
politics,Trump will seek out the Nielsen TV ratings though the campaign may go by stream views.
politics,"I did not see that on MSNBC but I know the passion these people feel. Facts don't help, logic doesn't help, and in many cases people once ""red pilled"" feel they need to 'save' their friends and family and just obsessively push videos, links to garbage outlets like Epoch times, Gateway pundit, and even Project Veritas.  

I think it's a little late for the social media platforms to finally realize this shit is dangerous, especially after how the Twitter Qanons shortly after they did their Allegiance Oath in June/July, they swarmed after Chrissy Teigen, then Wayfair and were starting to promote ANY one who has referenced pizza on twitter  

How and why these people go from normal to extreme so fast is amazing.  Especially those middle aged who used to be internet skeptics and warned ""just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true"" to ""I saw it on youtube, it's definitely true and if you don't believe me then you're a Marxist liberal demon!!!"""

politics,"Today is the last day in the Senate Judicial Committee. The hearing time can vary depending on any controversies that may aries from witness testimony.  For example, the Clarence Thomas nomination trial was extended due to the sexual harassment allegations from Anita Hill.  Seeing sexual harassment in the work place was a 'new' thing to discuss, it went longer than usual. 

It seems today the Committee will vote for the approval to go to floor, which it seems it will have a majority to do so.   The vote for the entire Senate to vote on her is currently scheduled 22 October.

I'm also getting tired of the outrage from Joy and Claire McCaskill."
politics,"I can't understand Trump just uses these ""wins"" not for the actual accomplishments but his struggle to find his next rally chant. 

I'm waiting for him to realize ""Three Nobel nominations and three SCOTUS judges!! SO MUCH WINNING""  which in reality all of these ""accomplishments"" were due to others nominating him or picking his nominees."
politics,"I've been using the Senate link after Monday when MSNBC cut out at 7:00 to resume normal programming.    While I'm not a fan of Earnst or Kennedy, the hearing should have been aired in it's entirety. 

Last night I popped onto MSNBC at about 6:00 PM and sure enough - regular programming.

politics,"I laugh when I think about how Trump feels he had to make sure there are 9 that if his legal arguments had any basis, a 5-3 would be sufficient.  Telling me he's just going to get the campaign legal team to just push to SCOTUS not on merit but on the odds and favorability. 

Which, of course, we all know that - it's just amazing how bad he is at trying to be sneaky.  He's like the toddler playing hide and go seek who sits in the middle of the living room floor with a blanket thinking you can't see them because they can't see you."
politics,">  Trump, the fucking president, who could name maybe three cases total (Roe, Obergefell, and Brown v. Board of Education…

I don't think he could name these at all and ***if*** he did would be able to know what precedents they put in place. 

One of the most ""tell all"" stories is from Mike Schmidt's recent book claimed Trump did not know how the DOJ actually works and was going to prosecute Hillary himself.  Don McGahn had to explain to Trump why he could not be a prosecutor against Hillary - or anyone, himself, personally, directly. 

The man is simply an armchair tv watcher with little to no means to learn, understand and has instead, the world shaped to meet his delusions and misconceptions of how the world works.  he's now surrounded by a group of people and a political party more than willing to oblige in changing reality to his delusions"
politics,"Yes, while being on the Bush v Gore team was and is notable, and will be #3 who was also on the team (Kav and Roberts the other 2), it's not like Ginsberg who actually pushed cases that were against the odds such [Moritz v. Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_v._Commissioner). 


Since I was also working while listening to the testimony portions, was she asked what she feels is her greatest professional accomplishment?"
politics,"So I'm trying to keep an open mind to deal with the fact Barrett was going to become the next SCOTUS Jurist before her name was even announced. 

Yet the one thing I cannot help and applies to the Gorsuch and Kavanaugh compared to the other SCOTUS's is any notable decision she's made.  Ginsberg and Marshall were lawyers who progressed due to their vigilance, detail, on point interpretations of the law... and Whitehouse nailed it that she was selected because of an underground method of lobbyists and special interest groups. 

I'm still waiting not for questions of her past cases and decisions - but any of them that actually were worthy of notation or exceptional.   Nothing. 

The only thing that put her on the map and this course was her ideology not her legal record.   To see this pointed out by Democrats and GOP being like ""yea, and?"" is frustrating."
politics,"Cornyn with the ""She has two adopted black children, so she's diverse"" misses the point by Coons that the Senate for Trump pushed a strong majority of white males as Federal judges and that Barrett fell short on Booker's questions regarding civil rights."
politics,Grassley witness can't figure out how to unmute and just pressing all the buttons with a facial expression between laughter and frustration is a moment I could watch on a loop.

politics,Should be noted the question and testimony aspect is over. Today is deliberations and Committee Vote.  We will not see more commentary from Barrett today.
politics,He's not.  I mean the man in [2016 put bacon on a gun to 'cook it' in ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZGaJrd3x8).  Hence why it was a funny poke at Ted.
politics,They are people so it's hard to say it won't or hasn't happened. Though generally they do have rules for decorum and it's accepted that these hearings and other formal proceedings are to be on the civil side.
politics,"I see..like how does a document make it to a Senator and eventually submitted.  

I would imagine the Staffers for each Senator assist in doing research, and also consider not only what they find but also what is submitted to them for relevancy.  Then when putting together their statements and arguments, it's all put together.  

I see it being very much like a legal process for a lawyer and a judge - considering most Senators have JD or have been practicing lawyers. 

I think the documents most relevant to their oral arguments, statements is what gets submitted and also the Chairman can determine ""no, that may not be put on record"" as well."
politics,"Yes, and they would be listed as exhibits respective to the Senator that submitted so there is a footnote reference in any formal report or transcript.   I would imagine if indexed the document would be listed with the references of each copy like in a book.  Not that hard to cross reference and would keep things extremely transparent and detailed. 

I'm sure there is a formal procedure, which I do not know, but this is more or less how items are handled in legal documents.  Like I can submit a document as an exhibit in a motion and the other party can also submit the same document as their own exhibit for reference in their response."
politics,"Yes, each Senator can submit documents into a case file.  As to how they organize that? Not sure but if there are duplicates I'm sure they're tagged by who submitted as an exhibit from the Senators time for reference.   I don't think there's a rule that only 1 Senator can submit a document and no other Senators cannot submit the same."
politics,"if you notice, many Senators ask the Chairman ""I'd like to put this letter on Record"" and Chair responds."
politics,"I married in 1993 and to someone Hispanic. It didn't really hit me that we were an interracial couple until his family calling me and my then BIL ""gringo"" out loud.   

We divorced in 1999; kids adults now and going to be a first time grandparent in a few months.  The little one on the way will be a third generation and a soup of diversity! 

While I think federal legislation will help with the no backsies, the laws are always going to be challenged by a shrinking minority in this country.  A little everyday, a lot overtime... we've made some big steps along the way since 1964."
politics,"No worries - 

Blumenthal tapped into it softly in the beginning of his time... and then led into a segue as to asking what would happen if marriage equality was reversed - which is a legit question. Like what happens do the couples already married keep their rights? the rights revoked? Do we go back to the old system where a couple's marriage is recognized in one state but not another? 

And yea, you have a point - we take advantage how some areas now are not even a second thought for so many, when in reality it was just over 50 years ago where it was a crime in Virginia. 

BTW, best and congrats to your son and SIL!"
politics,"yea, sure.  Cliff note version is in the late 60's when desegregation was legally eliminated, it was a case of a couple, a white man who married a black woman in Virginia. Virginia said that inter-racial marriage was illegal. So the couple (last name Loving) challenged the law and Supreme Court deemed that the law opposing inter-racial marriage was unconstitutional based on the 14th Amendment (no law shall apply to one group of people and not another in essence). 

Basically Blumenthal's line of questioning was prodding her to express some insight on how she interprets the 14th Amendment by asking about this case.   


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia
>Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), was a landmark civil rights decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that laws banning interracial marriage violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[1][2] The decision was followed by an increase in interracial marriages in the U.S. and is remembered annually on Loving Day. It has been the subject of several songs and three movies, including the 2016 film Loving. Beginning in 2013, it was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions holding restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States unconstitutional, including in the 2015 Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges.[3]"
politics,"Ones that are open cases I get - that seems fair not to comment on something she may actually review. 

Other stuff seems like a way to evade the accusations that she may expose herself as being an extremist or interpret civil rights in a manner that would harm her and the GOP and their agenda to shoot down ACA, Roe v Wade, and seems now add in Loving vs Virginia on interracial marriage."
politics,"Yea, Blumenthal's question about gay marriage was more or less asking her to simply say ""I would need more information and see how the 14th amendment would apply in cases along these lines"".

It was possible for her in many of these case questions to provide some level of ""I would see how xyz would apply to help base a direction on how the facts and case law would apply"" instead of ""nope, I can't/won't"" with no sort of reference or reason."
politics,"The post Romney [RNC Autopsy report from 2012](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/624581-rnc-autopsy.html) stated on page 9 that the GOP would being to lose strength unless they tried to appeal more to women and minorities.  

Then Trump happened and the quiet things went not just spoken out loud, but at ralies, amplified, on a stage."
politics,"I do believe she'll have to move from South Bend Indiana to the DC region.    There's a lot of transients in the region, many for career opportunities both long and short term. 

Also the GOP playing up the whole ""children of school age"" stuff is they're trying to make her out to being a role model for women and girls.  Not realizing what makes women and girls look up to other women - just being a woman is not enough. 

Same shit they pulled with Clarence Thomas - thinking he's a black man in the legal field, he's just like Thurgood Marshall!  

They miss the point because they don't understand why RGB and Marshall were as respected as they were - and only see it's because ""Jewish woman"" and ""black man"".   Not how or why those traits were so significant to their success, their ethics, their impact.   Yet complain about how the ""left is all about identity politics"".  

Perhaps the reason they can't see past the aesthetic aspects, they'd have to admit that Civil Rights is an area that needs work and all because these are groups that have been suppressed by older white men for centuries."
politics,Senate live stream audio is down too
politics,"I agree, she's better in this format than she was as a Presidential Candidate.  She's also a sort of a weird interview when she's on the cable shows giving commentary, though glad she's stopped answering everything with ""When I am President..."" stump responses not related to the questions anchors would ask her."
politics,"To think the reason Putin got pissed at us is because Hillary accused Putin of fixing his election in 2011. 

https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153

>When mass protests against Russian President Vladimir Putin erupted in Moscow in December 2011, Putin made clear who he thought was really behind them: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
>
>With the protesters accusing Putin of having rigged recent elections, the Russian leader pointed an angry finger at Clinton, who had issued a statement sharply critical of the voting results. “She said they were dishonest and unfair,” Putin fumed in public remarks, saying that Clinton gave “a signal” to demonstrators working “with the support of the U.S. State Department” to undermine his power. “We need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs,” Putin declared.

When you add in Trump was in Russia and had the Moscow Beauty Pageant in 2013 and then ran for President and those same Pageant buddies were like, ""hey, we can get Clinton dirt to help you win!""... and Trump pretty much more popular than anyone expected.... he (Putin) feels Hillary fucked with him, so he fucked with ours. 

Now, take the same rhetoric even in that short quote I pulled to today and Trump ""the system is rigged!"".  

The only thing different is it was the death of yet another unarmed black man due to a knee on his neck for 9 minutes that caused the mass protests, well before the election, not after.   

Though Trump has caused for that to be his ""Law and Order"" theme though so many in his orbit have been indicted, convicted or about to be.   Also seems odd the phone call transcripts from Putin are not released. I'm old enough to remember calls with foreign states were posted publicly with any sensitive/security stuff redacted. 

it's like it was simply all too good to be true for Putin and the Trump is a gift to Putin that just seems to keep giving."

and... here we are."
politics,"So true.  ""Back in the day"" the deliberations were mostly in Committee and on the floor and put it all aside when off the record. 

The Partisanship has definitely been predominant especially in days of late and with the Freedom Caucus (Tea Party) caucus taking over the moderates, it's definitely easy to see the change in a GoP platform to a more Trumpian like platform.

politics,"I'm amazed when I see on Twitter the Trump supporters touting ""the will of the people"" well, if that's true, well, Trump lost the popular vote and won by electoral college.    

Trump won the electoral college by micro targeting people from data collected from Facebook by Cambridge Analytica and the Russian IRA.  Cambridge Analytica who was also run by Steve Bannon and Jared and Manafort shared the data collected with the Russians....

Then throw on the layer that if it's really about the will of the people, wait until the election is over and we know who the next President is.  If there is confidence Trump will win, this is a no brainer. 

But we know there's not confidence in Trump based on current polling.   We also know the whole ""We need 9 Justices"" for any possible litigation to determine the election shows they anticipate legally challenging without merit or good faith, and that they need 9 to avoid a 4-4 and not confident that any litigation would be a 5-3 or higher ruling in the favor of Trump.

I think for the first time we're seeing the power of the white rich elites (both parties) being challenged by minorities and being heavily supported. 

Back a few decades any person of color who would claim ""systemic racism"" would be accused of reverse racism or just some sort of extremist - not someone representing a community that has been left out, diminished and not Representative for centuries. 

Based on knowing how conservatives fight and resist change, such as we saw with Brown v Education and the likes, the GOP, especially with Trump being the ""fuck your feelings"" leader, that the right has gone more right, causing the left to go more left. 

I also don't think it's a coincidence that Trump who on his announcement speech in 2015 was racist that he gained a lot of support as our first black President was about to complete his second term. 

But one thing is apparent - there is a shift happening in this country.... though because of Trump the shift that depends on who is next elected will determine if we go backwards and see the country change into a more authoritative state or Biden to just bring us back to something more normal."

If so, well, back in the day when Scalia was nominated the vote was that of a majority, not a nuclear simple majority. If McConnell didn't go nuclear with Gorsuch neither Gorsuch or Kavanaugh would have been approved.

> Physical decline is likely to be a major feature of the next few years of American politics, at least. The current line of succession, after Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, features Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is 80, and the Senate president pro tempore, Charles Grassley, 87, who also runs the Senate Finance Committee. Ms. Pelosi’s two most powerful deputies in the House, James Clyburn and Steny Hoyer, are both 80 or older. Over in the Senate, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee is 85 and coasting to re-election. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee is 86. Joe Biden, who turns 78 next month, is nearly a year younger than the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who is also seeking re-election in November.

If it wasn't for this video by Mulvaney, which once again the quiet part was said out loud, it's possible the strategy is knowing Trump has no platform, plans and too sensitive to take criticism.  Trump likes to be uncontested, doesn't like to be challenged. Biden is more comfortable and wants to teach about his platorm. 

The spectacle last night seemed a way to try to get Biden to lose his shit, get rustled, and silence him from communicating.  Hillary told the world who Trump was, and she was right.  No way Trump is going to let that happen again. 

The whole earpeice rumor started on Facebook, wound up on Twitter by a NY Post 'reporters' then echoed by the Trump WH Press Secretary (WTF on it's own) and Murtaugh within 10 minutes and several hours before the debate- seems the intent was to stop, prevent or otherwise shit on the debate from the beginning."

politics,"I've read some articles on focus groups of women and the whole process has turned about half of undecides towards Biden and away from the GOP.

Though Trump's WH took the whole big flag background and put it on steroids.

Then top it off with these older white guys saying that ACB is a woman that can also be a role model missing the point that it's not just being a woman that made RGB incredible, it was her record, her history, her wisdom, her mind.  It was as tone deaf, as many point out, of thinking a black man like Clarence Thomas would be enough to replace Thurgood Marshall. 

The GOP doesn't seem to understand why these Civil Rights icons cannot be replaced by a person of the same physical demographic.  

So it wasn't just the one aspect of moving fast, it's the flagrant snubbing, lack of respect or a moment to mourn.  The disrespect and lack of decency.

The whole premise basing ""Biden agreed"" is not substantiated by anyone on the Biden team.  Also seems odd when Biden's team was asked about drug testing that they failed to mention anything about ""ear inspections"" being agreed to 'several days ago"". Seems to be a whole chain of people tweeting, Murtaugh, McEnany, retweeting each other some narrative that does not exist... all within 10 minutes of each other.

The whole point of the emoluments clause which Trump has defied and being litigated is to ensure the President has no financial advantages, disadvantages or even the appearance of having financial influence domestically or by foreign states. 

YEt Trump has this thing in which no rules apply to him.  The GOP has done nothing to say ""dude, no"" and has protected him because they have used Trump for their own agendas and who knows, perhaps some of the honey pot.   The Senate GOP even had a fundraiser at Trump DC International Hotel literally a couple nights before the impeachment trials started in the Senate.  That's not just an overt conflict of interest, it has an appearance of quid pro quo and other nefariousness - or fair to say not a fair and impartial gathering in which the 'trial' ended in an acquittal with no witnesses testifying.

I think this is a reference to American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

While not exactly bipartisan, it did pass Senate with 61–37 in February 2009. 

This type of wording implies that Obama acted unilaterally but he did not.  

By today's standards, that would be as close to a bipartisan passed legislation in the Senate that we've seen in since 2010 which is now simple majority and usually party lines.

I think that would be interesting - good question.  But when Maddow had something like that a few years ago, it was a big flop.. but if Trump's peopel can show that the line was other than $750, that would definitely be a good response... if he paid more, then show us just that one page and line."
politics,"Read the NYT article.. give yourself about a half hour - it's a long, detailed read.  It's four years worth summarized with more info to come.  It goes from Trump Tower to Russia Pagent to The Apprentice to Mar A Lago to the european resorts/clubs, to expenses shifted to other companies to show a loss.. the lying on the federal disclosure form, owing 400M in loans due in the next 4 years, a balloon payment of 100M coming up, and a possible another 100M in restitution/fees for a refund that may have been based on inflated/depreciated numbers..."
politics,"I don't see why any document from Trump or his agents/lawyers/accountants would need to be redacted at all, if that were to happen. 

It would take more than a few pages to debunk this story, in my view. We're probably talking cases and cases of printed documents.   I mean just the 500 or so small corporations is going to be several cases of printed paper on it's own for one year's of returns."
politics,"Oh, so a sitting president with $400 Million due in the next four years isn't a national security issue or concern?  Especially by a guy using his own properties to funnel tax payer money into through his hotel for fundraisers, or secret service travel even when the hotel or resort is closed?  Living rent free at the most famous address in the country? 

Hmph."
politics,"One way Trump could prove the NYT wrong is to....reveal all the documents themselves.  

The plural being it's not just Trump but all accounting professionals involved in the preparation and filing of all the Trump personal, his children, senior level management, NBC, all business corporates filings for every property, company, agency, franchise, resort and golf country clubs, hotels, all copyrights.."
politics,They do; they're usually released during elections as challengers and incumbents.  Except Trump.
politics,"it's not just income taxes, it's also corporate taxes, lying on a federal disclosure form saying he made money when he actually lost money."
politics,"He should put that to his $400,000 million in upcoming loans or pay back the $100M he's going to have to pay back."
politics,"No.  It actually eliminated the most common ones used by common people - like uniform expenses and increased the write offs for people who have one or more LLC's.   You know, because everyone has an LLC!  And benefited people like Trump and other Senators with business interests including former Senator Bob Corker who invested in real estate heavily."
politics,"This wasn't one source.  It's several over four years.  The primary article shows they were able to go through various company returns, credit card reports and the likes.   

The same reporters also discovered findings in 2019 - they're using whatever public sources they can and it seems other sources have come up.  It could be Michael Cohen; it could be someone anonymous.  

It seems possible some documents will be released - though soethin like this didn't just go to print. Something this big, this serious and again, editors commented, that the story has been gone through the legal department - they would not risk their reputation or liability for libel or slander, illegal acts on something this explosive and was a 'maybe'.   

It's good to be skeptical and agree if this was more like the Pentagon Papers with some published items, it would be more solid of a story. We'll have to see if that develops."
politics,He lied on his Federal Financial Disclosure form with the OGE.  That's a no-no and just a drop in the bucket.
politics,"Ha, he also had to pay $25 Million to the class action suit for the whole Trump University scam and have resolved before the inauguration in 2017."
politics,"well, $280,000.  He paid off McDougal too."
politics,"He filed a financial disclosure form with the Government showing he had gains when he actually had losses; if he lied on the bank loans showing inflated assets and depreciated the same on his taxes.... a lot.  That's a lot of federal violations with several agencies.

The federal disclosure form is also that of sworn document - it's not just a financial form; it's a legal attachment.  This is done with the Office of Government Ethics to actually help the President avoid any sort of legal issues.  Though this Administration and President has ignored the OGE and put in place people that are lax."
politics,"Also, doesn't help if you're donations have decreased, change your RNC convention venue several times to four locations, stopping and starting campaign ads because there's no platform or plan, and getting an army of lawyers set and already filing in states to oppose mail in ballots."
politics,Mitt Romney's Executive Assistant paid more in taxes percentage wise than he did when he released his taxes in his Campaign against Obama.
politics,"To protect the sources.  This has been a 4 year investigation and the Editors released a separate comment on it as well as the NYT intro hitting on it a bit in the opening.

politics,"Or that the government is FOR the people, and a giant big ass non-profit and should not be run like a for profit private organization?"
politics,"and yet he wanted to pump $100,000,000 of his own money into the campaign... ""just write it off as a loss"". 

And we still don't know where the inauguration money went."
politics,Question is if Melania divorces him if Trump can honor the prenup agreement she had to renegotiate after paying off at least two women for the election in hush money while cheating on her when pregnant/just had Barron.
politics,"The article explains it's not just personal income tax but also corporate which he sort of combined, with several hundred small loss companies, his production company with the Apprentice, the resorts, the real estate.  Not like it was a simple 1040 based on take home pay and investments.   

He was taking profits from one company, putting them as losses in the other companies, writing as much as he could off like ""consulting fees"" and items that are normal operations like Linens and silverware at Mar A Lago, personal ones like his jet travel...

The article is long and goes into it. More articles to come."

politics,"On a disclosure in 2017, he had two huge loans with Deutsche Bank who is currently under investigation for buying Doral resort. But they didn't total $400 million as reported."
politics,I also don't think Barr or Mnuchin will go after Trump for federal violations.
politics,writing off huge losses and expenses from one company to another one.
politics,You're also asking about literally thousands of pages of documents.  It sounds like they went through several hundred sources and returns since part of this creative financing was to the 500 or so small companies Trump has.
politics,John Gotti?
politics,"LOL The article has no PDF's of any documents.  The article even indicated they will be protecting their sources tightly though I'm sure some will be released and redacted. 

Funny how the conservative alt right MAGA Qanons are all ""FREE SPEECH"" When their Twitters get suspended for TOS violations and want to have Section 203 taken away...but this first amendment stuff... is wrong?  HA, this article is exactly why the Bill of Rights has 1A as 1A - accountability and transparency especially as it relates to our government  - not protecting false information on COVID, voting or hate speech.

politics,Yes. His half of The Apprentice show. he was a producer.
politics,"The article indicated there will be more exposes released. This was a four year investigation so I expect future follow ups to have more details. I think this was the introduction and ""hold on to your asses; shit's coming down the road"""
politics,"Where else has Trump been known to try to play three card monte with reporting information, data?  Hmmm....is it likely that these financials disclose that Trump lives off of credit, in the millions, and then will use nefarious accounting that benefits him directly and personally??? 

This shows Trump will just rob Peter to pay Paul, has 400M reasons to stay in office, and is doing the same thing by his Executive agencies fucking with reports and records of children taken from parents, COVID reporting etc.   

He'll do what he needs to do to make him self seem better and best benefits him.   It's not just an ethical or moral dilemma - he's doing it to humans, people and with our money and without our best interest first and foremost, which he took an oath to do. 

He needs to get out of our House."
politics,"Yea, this is an expose with more details to come.  There are so many elements to this - that yea, he had a team doing these taxes, company set ups, etc.   This was more than a 'whoops'."
politics,"> they treat me like the Tea Party, like they treated the Tea Party

The sad thing is I don't know what he means - the Boston Tea Party like with Samuel Adams or if he means the GOP Libertarian Tea Party from 2010 which are now his most loyal supporters (Freedom Caucus)"
politics,"They've been investigating for nearly 4 years.  It seems based on the article, there's so much to these returns, loans, investments, losses.  

They expand from the Apprentice, to real estate investments, loans, the golf resorts and country clubs, to write offs, pumping revenue from one large organization to 500 smaller companies to have corporate losses.. ""Consultant fees"" in the millions which could be bribes of international property and copyrights."
politics,"> In 2012, he took out a $100 million mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower. He took nearly the entire amount as a payout, his tax records show. His company has paid more than $15 million in interest on the loan, but nothing on the principal. The full $100 million comes due in 2022.
> 
> In 2013, he withdrew $95.8 million from his Vornado partnership account.
> 
> And in January 2014, he sold $98 million in stocks and bonds, his biggest single month of sales in at least the last two decades. He sold $54 million more in stocks and bonds in 2015, and $68.2 million in 2016. His financial disclosure released in July showed that he had as little as $873,000 in securities left to sell.
> 
> Mr. Trump’s businesses reported cash on hand of $34.7 million in 2018, down 40 percent from five years earlier.
> 
> What’s more, the tax records show that Mr. Trump has once again done what he says he regrets, looking back on his early 1990s meltdown: personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy.
> 
> ***This time around, he is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.***"

politics,"The whole point of the Supreme Court is to determine the constitutionality of laws. Marbury vs Madison determined that judicial review *is* the role of SCOTUS. 

When a law is deemed unconstitutional, it only seems appropriate that the law is undone and done so by case law.  Also, Federal Courts overrule State courts - that's why the Supreme Court is ""the law of the land"".

politics,"Why are military votes going to the Wilkes Barre region of PA when there is no base there?   I Mean I would imagine absentee votes go to the primary base of a military as location of residence but I'm not sure.   

For instance, an Army 101 Airborne based in NC, is deployed overseas wouldn't their registered voting place be Fayetteville, NC and not their hometown? 

Wilkes Barre is a pretty blue collar town with no base though has great views, people and perogies."
politics,"A lid does not mean a day off.  It means no press coverage.  He's likely preparing for the debate.  One recent lid was due to Biden doing a fundraiser.    There's been plenty of days where Trump had no scheduled events on his official calendar and we know he was watching Fox News, like several hours in one day."
politics,"My wishful thinking and just based on thoughts and not anything substantiated: 

1. Trump will lose the electoral and popular vote - though close enough to challenge in some states.  He'll be humiliated if he's not the clear winner, especially in red states.

2. He'll fight in court and some state supreme courts will not vote in his favor.  He'll be humiliated by the decisions and will appeal. 

3. The goal will be go to SCOTUS where ""His"" Supreme Court will vote for him.   Though the case could be dismissed or the opinions will not be in his favor. He will be humiliated yet again. 

Trump's narcissism can't allow for humiliation or losing.  I hope if anything all his rhetoric on how the system is rigged, fake, fraud, etc works against him citing that his intention was always to muddle the election process through discrediting of the system. 

I don't think he realizes in order for im to 'win' he may first have to cope with a lot of losing."
IAmA,"Excellent - thank you - the social media suggestions I need to heed your guidance as I'm not on Snapchat, IG.... perhaps it's time!"
IAmA,"Thank you so much! I knew it was going to be a good one!  

Your response is appreciated, and I believe I've heard Neal Katyal share like sentiments about the SC laws and having more independence.  I do hope we can see legislation pass to do just that, though how would that be structured? Would it be akin to an Independent counsel such as Ken Starr?

Now, please excuse me. I need to go do a very happy dance that I have had an actual interaction with such a legal icon! (Big fan!)"
IAmA,"another question for Victor: What is the best way to teach the younger generations that what we are experiencing now, is not normal?   This administration and Congressional caucus has been the most polar, divided I've ever seen, and I am a GenXer. 

Its hard to explain that ""Back in the day"" it took a 60 Senate vote for any major appointment, not a simple majority of 51, and that Democrats and Republicans were more amicable off the floor and committee hearings. 

For instance, the people in the summary like Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt are former Republicans and now working in the Lincoln Project to have a bipartisan coalition.  How can they reach out to young people to show what bipartisan engagement looks like and is possible? 

(I haven't listened to your podcast yet, so forgive if this is a good resource)"
politics,"""Countless""?  I recall there was one recently and that was for him to partake in a donation event.  Having a lid is only for the press, doesn't mean he takes the day off.   

SInce the DNC Biden has been doing more appearances, though I do agree he needs to step it up a little.  One critiscm early on is that he wouldn't get people riled up with the same energy as say Sanders or Trump.  

However, in our current COVID state, I think that's something his team needs to figure out - how to get some sort of higher energy knowing that Trump is now on high gear doing rallies neary every day.   If anything his Twitter account needs to be a bit more stron on real time messaging."
