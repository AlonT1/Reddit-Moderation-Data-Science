TexasPolitics,"IMO this an argument for ""defunding the police"" by redistributing funds to programs that actually reduce crime. Instead of spending tax dollars on this sign posting that comes off as a) virtue signaling and b) government overreach the city could commit to exploring why these communities are experiencing heightened crime and how work in conjunction with the community.

TexasPolitics,It's relevant because it's not informed by evidence based research and social science. So it's not a stretch to think that an attorney General who either eschews it is ignorant of actual research around the issue would also separate children.
TexasPolitics,"You're right. Except in more complicated situations where the local police forces were involved in either propping up the gang violence or the perpetrators of the violence.

TexasPolitics,"I don't disagree with this but i think it's also important to focus on what's to blame here. Trump had a clear strategy set out to disrupt and sow chaos. Our politics has become more divisive. But Trump was flinging shit from the beginning. Short term, sound the alarm, vote for Biden and reject incivility and theatrics. Long term, reform the system and advocate for changes on a bottom up path"

TexasPolitics,"Yard signs don't vote. From what it seems the Biden campaign has decided to run a more aggressive digital campaign. I'm not saying your gloom and doom isn't true, and Biden is certainly boring, but I think you are understating his messaging. 

If Beto got support because he was exciting than it wasn't because of his policy proposals was it. Jessica Cisneros is a great example of how this isn't nearly enough. She lost to a milquetoast moderate, presumably had a decent ground game, and was running on ""exciting"" policy."
TexasPolitics,"I don't mean to shame you for this point (or those people) but policy wise which the other user is mentioning Bernie and Biden have similar goals. So if their vote was at all motivated based off policy, their sitting out makes no sense."
TexasPolitics,"do you think this would be useful? The Republican party didn't even update their platform. 

Trump is running on ""I'm the best."" And its a close election. I get the voter enthusiasm thing but Trump is on pace to appoint 3 Supreme Court Justices in his term. How much of the onus for how our government runs should be on voters and what they choose to pay attention to?"
TexasPolitics,Tl;Dr there is no evidence that increased turnout only helps one side.
fakebaseball,"I never do well in these situations

TexasPolitics,"I think people are being forced into a hard place where one party doesn't really represent a broader policy platform (heck they didn't even update their platform at their convention) and the other does represent some but is still problematic. So part of pushing against the dominant party is also signaling a real intent to to have better politicians.

Policy isn't made at the polls anymore. Get involved in different ways if the two party system pisses you off so much."

TexasPolitics,That's not what I said. I mentioned his ability to pay cash bail suggest it wouldn't have hindered him at all.

The most recent time was for forging government documents. It's not the perfect situation for proving your case because he was able to pay the bail anyway.

Instead of thinking of exceptions that might make cash bail reform dangerous its better to look at why the police and the justice system failed so completely in this regard and if it was preventable."

The budget cut isn't directly threatening the security detail, the police  chief is suggesting that if the cut is made, they would stop detailing the Mayor.

TexasPolitics,"so per the lawsuit. Paxton is alleging that sending out 2 million ballots is ""violating the voting rights of the citizens of this state"". And per the the article they are making the ""mail in ballots increase voter fraud"" argument that has been unsubstantiated.

fakebaseball,"Connor is the last line for the Cards in what has been a somewhat quiet game for both offenses. He comes to the plate and ready to do... Something.

He chips at the first pitch while jawing at the umps. ""so many errors.."" he starts and the umps bristle self conscious.

He then turns around and takes a ball, looking direct at the umps ""a man's life... Is full of so many errors. We must embrace that man is fallible in order to truly live happy.""

The ump gestures towards the pitcher.

""a man can only do so much, and expect to never be exhausted. He has to be his true self.""

At the last minute he turns and takes a swing..

It's a towering beauty. Deep. And Connor watches it with interest but some resignation.

The ball lands in the outfielders glove and he nods his head.

I haven't gotten around to digging into their sources but the NYT one they link looks very in depth.

TexasPolitics,"I think you have special glasses on. 

Most pollsters in 2016 had it within a margin of error. Sure NYT famously had it at 99% likelihood, but sites that aggregate polls like 538 had it at 33%

Also the media latches on to narratives where poll aggregators are constantly adjusting. So if 6 months out there are signs of a blue wave, that becomes the media narrative, even if polls aren't reliable then. 

Finally iirc the House pickup was historically big for the Dems. It wasn't just ""the House flipped"" it was the House flipped in a big way, including with districts Trump won in a deep way. 

I don't recall the Senate pickups but I imagine they were in deep Trump territory?"

TexasPolitics,Racism pertains to the belief that one race is superior to another. A view you've stated here. Hardly a buzzword huh
TexasPolitics,"Obviously there's no use responding to you because you use buzzwords to push your racist narrative. But Watson didn't even complete a research study to back up his racist views. He simply said it.

So you're right. You don't know what peer reviewed science is. I should go back and review my masters level research. I might have missed all the times I was pushing a cultural Marxist narrative."
TexasPolitics,"This is not how peer reviewed science works. There's no incentive to push out narratives and scientists who do (like that anti vaxxer asshole) are quickly discredited by the scientific community.
