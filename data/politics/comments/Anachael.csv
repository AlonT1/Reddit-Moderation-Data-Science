deadbydaylight,Survivors complain way more about killers behavior than the perks they run.
memes,Behold! It's the vietnamese milk melon!
deadbydaylight,"Original Survivor: quick, get on the generator!

survivor wrongfully convicted of witchcraft: see about that..."
deadbydaylight,"no, the tbagging swf will kill you via stroke."
deadbydaylight,Had a Jake bait me and hop into a locker so the last guy could finish opening the gate... I am just fine sitting here for the 30 seconds you have left on ds. I'll even use the egc bar as my timer.
deadbydaylight,Steve is a sand worm
deadbydaylight,"You stop that, logic isn't allowed on the internet"
deadbydaylight,yeah I open the gate myself if I have a feeling they're going to be assholes about it. I did get lucky once and a Meg was tbagging facing me.... a huntress.... with hatchets. God it felt good to slap her back on the hook.
deadbydaylight,Ok but if they're bringing keys that means they want a fast game and if you mori them they get out faster!
deadbydaylight,"That wasn't a huntress that was a demon evicted from hell, please contact your local police department immediately."
deadbydaylight,"When they loop back into you and end up vaulting into your loving arms, injured, and you get a free grab."
deadbydaylight,"That's what I'm saying. If you really are suffering so much as a killer and you think survivor is the only way you can have fun, play survivor. There are other killers."
deadbydaylight,"Ok hear me out. Make the model hotter than the original.  We get one more pretty thing to look at and if it ever makes it to court we get even more entertainment. Enter the mean girl defense: ""sorry dude this character is obviously way too cute to be you"". Case dismissed!"
deadbydaylight,"Dude just... make him hotter than the original. Why go the golem route???? 


In all seriousness thank you for the response!"
deadbydaylight,Does anyone here understand character models? Can you explain how this went so horribly wrong because???
deadbydaylight,"I just saw that! I'm especially interested in the more ""sympathetic"" characters like Wraith, Spirit, and Plague. Killer versions of survivors people love to hate seem interesting too"
deadbydaylight,I love the idea of having killer/survivor versions of the same character and these perks are awesome. If you decide to do others I'm sure they'll be just as amazing
deadbydaylight,These Nancy outfits are sent to punish us for the fashion sins of the past
deadbydaylight,"I understand that, regardless of how optimal the usage is, it still only works part of the time."
deadbydaylight,The only valid use of an exhaustion perk tbh
deadbydaylight,"I know how to use it! 

Step 1: time it perfectly

Step 2: get hit anyways 

Step 3: you're exhausted? you're exhausted. 

Step 4: profit"
deadbydaylight,"amen, 99 that shit for ultimate pro gamer plays"
deadbydaylight,"Dear lithe gang, 

Windows.

Sincerely, 
Sprint burst gang"
deadbydaylight,window hitboxes may be trash but getting exhausted but still downed because dead hard is broken is bullshit too
deadbydaylight,I would use the fuck out of a grandma Laurie Skin
deadbydaylight,"blighted spirit guarantees a tunneling 

Lauries?? I thought they were mostly harmless"
deadbydaylight,Nothing better than being on the hook and seeing all 3 teammates self caring less than 10 feet from each other against a thana/sloppy legion
deadbydaylight,"Conversely when you have someone on your team in a bright cosmetic and you expect them to go for a save or something but instead they've become one with the bush. You fucking lied to me Nea, never show your face in that cosmetic around me again."
deadbydaylight,Classic P3 Claudettes letting me go into struggle on my first hook even though the killer isn't showing up anywhere in my kindred radius
deadbydaylight,"This is why I like the new kindred so much. Fuck u I see you insidious leatherface and corner lurking trapper. 

On the flip side if I'm on the hook we are waiting out the full 120 seconds while I watch those gens pop cause I'm petty like that."
deadbydaylight,"God said you can't have this one today, Danny"
deadbydaylight,"buckle up kiddos, these armpits are about to get all the way spicy"
deadbydaylight,then they run directly into the killer and complain about tunneling in the postgame chat
AskReddit,"Seagull, mountain lion, wild turkey"
AmItheAsshole,"NTA it's hard dealing with ingrained behaviors like that especially when it comes to family. As long as they know you're uncomfortable with it I understand you just wanting to avoid them rather than deal with it. As for what your father said yes they may have grown up during a time where that behavior was accepted but you can't just decide when you stop evolving as a person and expect others to ""just deal with it"". Once upon a time people thought babies couldn't feel pain so they would operate on them without anesthetic. We used to think germs were imaginary things only poor people had. 

All of this being said, of they were to ever bring their racism outside of the shadows (where it belongs) and lash out at minorities you would be an asshole if you didn't say anything."
deadbydaylight,i think this is the only time i've ever emotionally identified with a billy
deadbydaylight,add the Grim Reaper as a survivor you cowards
deadbydaylight,is that a Blendette in the corner
deadbydaylight,"I've got another scenario for you.

They've done 2 gens and as you put your second survivor on their death hook, a gen pops.

You start getting notifications for rushed actions.

You find Feng Min self-caring on the hatch and Blendette head ons you then opens the hatch.

Fade to black.

""GG EZ baby killer"""
deadbydaylight,pharmacy is great for pharming medkits when the blood webs leave you high and dry
deadbydaylight,someone said that the deal with being able to use his character might stipulate that bhvr isn't allowed to touch the mask
deadbydaylight,Two Myers one Kate
deadbydaylight,He is also on a lot of drugs to keep himself awake. Trust me no one hates goblin Quentin more than goblin Quentin.
deadbydaylight,I got lucky and got a totem trapper for my first try. That totem is all yours buddy ima just head out.
deadbydaylight,those hobbit gremlins are horrifying
deadbydaylight,Confetti pallet
deadbydaylight,Assert your dominance by blinking behind the gate
deadbydaylight,I bet she doesn't abuse the basement bug
deadbydaylight,Yeahh I agree 100% but when people kept bringing it up all I saw was this meme so I brought it to life
deadbydaylight,it's all fun and games until you get matched with a duo of head on gamers that are spamming locker notifications
deadbydaylight,"Spite: if the killer remains within 10 meters of you for an entire hook state all other survivors are granted a 5/7/9% increase to the speed of all actions. If the killer remains for the entirety of the sacrifice the survivors will also gain the endurance status effect the next time they are hit. 

Any actions to rush the hook timer will result in this perk becoming inactive for the rest of the trial."
deadbydaylight,I wasn't either but Oh boy it keeps coming up. I do agree actually taking away someone's ability to play is slightly worse than getting gen rushed.
deadbydaylight,LITERALLY SANIC ohmygod I love it but it sounds like hell at the same time
deadbydaylight,I'm so sorry!! Don't worry I plan on walking into the ocean as soon as this match is over
deadbydaylight,Apparently it was supposed to give a 15% speed boost to opening gates but that speed boost got applied to everything so all the survivors running wake up were basically on crack.
deadbydaylight,Listen a nurse at red ranks told me that so it has to be true!
deadbydaylight,Something tells me Freddy Krueger doesn't care about the letter of the law
deadbydaylight,"The story behind why I made this meme is because a red rank nurse was fighting to hook us in the basement, only the basement, I'm talking they were hauling ass across the map and redowning us to get us there. When we asked if they knew about the bug they said ""it's in the game lol don't play if you can't handle it"" 

Bro you're playing one of the strongest killers in the game and you're still purposely glitching people out? Scumbag alert"
deadbydaylight,Primarily the basement bug but also things like sandbagging your teammates in order to get the hatch or face camping.
deadbydaylight,"dude devour hope and face camping, ULTIMATE big brain plays right here"
deadbydaylight,If that's their only trick then they should perish.
deadbydaylight,I appreciate it and I appreciate you
deadbydaylight,the ultimate gen camper my dude
deadbydaylight,"Holy shit that's insane. I wonder how fast those bars were going... But what's the point really, if the game last 20 seconds then everyone got cucked out of anything more than a handful of blood points."
deadbydaylight,What the hell was this wake up glitch everyone is having war flashbacks over
deadbydaylight,You're right it's your job to kill not to crash someones game which is what the basement hooks have been doing due to this glitch.
deadbydaylight,Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should
deadbydaylight,yes.
deadbydaylight,"Dude I'd rather get moried, literally stab me in the face it's better than getting put in the sunken place."
deadbydaylight,"you're a good person, I wish more people were as considerate as this"
deadbydaylight,Dude this isn't someone telling you not to run NOED this is asking you to literally not crash someones game.
deadbydaylight,Only if you carry them back up and let them wiggle off once you get it
deadbydaylight,Damn typos. Ash doesn't deserve this.
deadbydaylight,I play both! But I'm new so whenever someone pulls off a spicy play like this I just take notes
deadbydaylight,Any tips for getting better at looping killers as a survivor?
deadbydaylight,Over the span of a few games you get that naturally my dude
deadbydaylight,Even then all they had to do was remove the 'complete this in a single trial' qualifier and it's manageable. The other challenges like damage a gen 40x are meant to take some time so they didn't need to be changed.
deadbydaylight,Tbh if I was the killer I couldn't even be mad
deadbydaylight,Truly an unsolvable situation. Good heavens I've been outplayed.
deadbydaylight,Had a match of all red survivors and a rank 16 hag. It felt terrible
deadbydaylight,Rin = Crunchy Vacuum Bitch
deadbydaylight,Bubonic Babe is thrown around alot
deadbydaylight,Or 99 nearby hooks then start popping them when the heartbeat goes crazy or spine chill does its thing
deadbydaylight,Let's see your Onion do this bitchboys
deadbydaylight,"Toxic killers fly under the radar a lot bc of the whole ""entitled survivor bad"" and ""it's my job to kill you lol I'm not ur friend"". I'm never mad if someone kills me through genuine skill at most I get mad at myself for stupid plays I made."
deadbydaylight,I once had a killer tell me that if I don't want to get tunneled I shouldn't run directly into him next time... he put me in the basement and body blocked the stairs both times I was rescued. Completely ignoring the Nancy that rescued me. I was a salty salty boy.
deadbydaylight,My favorite is when they run into you and just walk away as calmly as possible
deadbydaylight,A killer that can slam the pallet down to stun a survivor
deadbydaylight,Wii remote safety straps for items
deadbydaylight,prayer beads and an ebony; none of you are free of sin
deadbydaylight,"Dude this happened when I was playing hag on a cold wind map, nothing will ever satisfy me like those 4 devour hope moris."
deadbydaylight,"Also I forgot to add, during this match I got around 5 grabs because the survivors wouldn’t stop working the gens when I appeared. Why the HELL would I go anywhere else??"
deadbydaylight,Jesus Christ that is one paranoid build. That spirit must have spicy armpits 24/7
deadbydaylight,...they were the last three though. If they’re close enough together (which they were) ANY gen patrolling is going to look like “camping”
deadbydaylight,THANK YOU. If I chase ONE of you then you pop the gen and you all get out. You must think I’m booboo the fool if you think I’m going to chase your ass to a dead area of the map.
deadbydaylight,my god. I was the real victim all along
deadbydaylight,"Actual conversation (he was talking about when they were trying to finish the last generator)

salt boy: you never left the area with the generators

me (Freddy): ...to go where

salt boy: to chase! God you’re so bad the only way you got any kills is by gen camping 

me: lol

salt boy: trash player never play again

me: well what does that say about you?

salt boy: what

me: I killed you so if I’m trash what are you

salt boy: 

salt boy: you only won by gen camping"
deadbydaylight,Really? I heard about it around the same time someone told me about the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny
deadbydaylight,"I played a match as the plague earlier, someone cleansed in the first minute and everyone else dc’d"
deadbydaylight,I was! My poor Dweet
deadbydaylight,Congrats that’s your new main now
deadbydaylight,shit u right. This post is cancelled everyone go home.
deadbydaylight,deliverance Adam was salty because we couldn’t save him from a facecamping Ghost Face
deadbydaylight,I actually started crawling in the opposite direction when that happens now. A doctor kept moving me away from the open exit gate so I went to explore the boat instead lmao. He found my body then ended up dcing himself.
deadbydaylight,Sometimes they pick you back up and carry you to the exit so you can open it yourself. I understand wanting the hatch closure points if you’re giving up hook points.
deadbydaylight,"For good reason, what a cunt. A leatherface tried to do this to me once but he topped it off by whirling around with his chainsaw. When he started walking me towards the hook I said fuck that and dc’d. Only time I’ll dc."
deadbydaylight,Plus most of the time they’re the ones that opened the gate and put themselves on countdown. If shit starts to fall apart I’m going to assume you’re waiting at the threshold to t-bag so there’s no point trying to chase.
deadbydaylight,They should make it so only one killer can get out alive
deadbydaylight,I once had a billion notifications go off so I finally go over to check. Meg wanted me to watch her escape through the hatch so she kept vaulting back and forth.
deadbydaylight,the gens are fighting back
deadbydaylight,Dude being a Blendette is totally black girl magic. I was so excited when I saw Claudette because she is completely self-sufficient and got that stealth going on.  I ain’t tryna get spotted because I’m wearing a neon jumpsuit.
deadbydaylight,"T-bagging, flashlights, y’know classic tomfoolery that earns you a hook through the shoulder

also I was Hag and she just kept RUNNING THROUGH EVERY TRAP I swear to god she was looking for them, she’d pop one t-bag if I teleported then sprint off, like fuck you m8."
bullybackfire,Well for one they don’t pepper spray into the wind lmao
bullybackfire,"amateurs, they need to get some notes from Hong Kong police"
starterpacks,“It was just the wind”
wow,"Sylvanas actually did kill herself at the end of Wrath but she wound up in hell (possibly just a really bad trip due to being impaled by old God blood) then struck a deal with the valkyr who took her place in hell so they could be free from the control of the new lich king

But of course Blizzard dropped the ball on in-game storytelling so you have to dig this shit up"
ucla,Just enjoy the ride my friend. Academia hurts so good. 
ucla,"My number one advice is to get those jitters all the way out of yourself. UCLA may be your dream school but there are a plethora of things that the other schools can offer you that you may not be able to get at UCLA. If it's about school prestige most people don't care about that stuff until grad school. 

THAT BEING SAID

I'm a UCLA transfer and you are more accomplished than I was. Your personal statement is the clincher and you have to show ""real character"" to stick the landing.

The transfer experience is somewhat overwhelming but there are tools to make things easier. Consider dorming in a transfer dorm, speak to counselors and/or professors before things reach tipping points. Lastly, keep up with the work; if you're coming from a semester system into the quarter system get ready for whiplash but if you came this far you can certainly handle it. And don't beat yourself up if you get a couple low grades, the first quarter is basically you trying to find your footing so give yourself a break if you feel like you aren't meeting your old standards. 

I'm rambling but if you need anymore help/info feel free to dm me!"
ucla,"Hang in there, it always seems like we are in a pressure cooker when it comes to academics and it can be hard to admit to ourselves that we're doing something right. You are taking care of yourself and reaching out which is such a positive step. You have plenty of people offering to chat with you because none of us want you to feel alone! Feel free to pm me to talk about anything!! It's going to be alright and it is ok to not be ok."
politics,The lying apple doesn't fall far from the lying tree
politics,Thank you for doing this! I'm wondering how your job has changed in the last 2 years. Between how weird things are and the attacks on American journalists what have you had to change?
AmItheAsshole,"I'm out and about for most of the day. Also I should mention her boyfriend lives 2 floors above us and she has spent days there with no problem... and her house is 20 minutes from the dorms (whereas I'm 10 hours from home, I do spend time in my other friends' dorm but they're in triples and I don't want to overstay my welcome).

&#x200B;

Edit: I could probably leave the room more, I recently started finding different places to study. My main hobby is gaming so it probably does seem like I'm always in the room."
kpop,Pentagon's Jinho and Wooseok are always being babied by the group even though Jinho is the oldest and Wooseok towers over all of them 
Overwatch,RIP W key. F.
AmItheAsshole,"Because I was coming back from class and she would have her boyfriend waiting in our room while she was out in the lounge or on the phone. She wouldn't even tell me when he was in there 

Edit: And she was demanding an explanation for me not wanting him to come in and out freely "
AmItheAsshole,"The reslife people want me to ""try living with her with the contract"" but believe me I'm looking for an out"
AmItheAsshole,No I said he can come over when I'm not sleeping or studying 
AmItheAsshole,No I said he can come over when I'm not sleeping or studying lol
kpop,"Fan: Jinyoung oppa! annyeong~
Jinyoung: Oppa? AnnyeonghaseYO

And the time Jonghyun exposed Minho for wearing shoe lifts because it was making him feel shorter "
kpop,A.C.E caught my eye with the fun summery color palette for Take Me Higher then I saw the crop tops 10/10 they have a fan in me now
politics,He's actually young compared to some of the other senators 
ucla,"Yo I'm also a first gen from the bay. Not to alarm you but DON'T OVERPACK. it fucking sucks man and you can't move stuff out little by little like the locals can.

I'd just bring clothes (one solid duffel bag should be good), sheets, personal hygiene stuff, whatever you need for class, and a lamp. 

I knew people on the hill with bikes and it worked for them but man the hills are no joke. UCLA is nice because everything is pretty close together. Having a bike might be nice but not having one isn't the end of the world.

A uhaul may seem cheaper but those fuckers eat up gas.  If you can try to find a gas saving rental (I took a Prius trunk worth of stuff and still had more than enough)

Lastly you are going to forget little stuff but it's better to pick them up along the way than to jam your entire house into your side of the dorm. 

Good luck and be kind to yourself!"
ucla,the air is nice when the city isn't on fire
ucla,you don't have to be on a diet to enjoy their medium rare chicken!
ucla,It's 25 bucks and they only do it at the beginning of the school year unless they changed something since last year
JustBootThings,yes.
kpop,I'm just happy that they seem happy. Throwing a bunch of puppies at someone can take a lot of pressure off of them when they're answering questions in another language. I haven't seen idols nearly as comfortable tackling English in say a Billboard interview.
OverwatchUniversity,"I do have characters from each category I'm decent with! Dive tanks and Orisa, for damage Junkrat or Soldier.

I am always keeping track of who has ult and who doesn't but I do need to get quicker at recognizing a lost team fight/when healing is doing more harm than good."
HomeImprovement,Awesome thank you so much!
HomeImprovement,"So if you had to give a rough ROUGH estimate (I won't quote you or come back ranting) what is a reasonable estimate .

Basically how high is scam high."
HomeImprovement,The water damage is primarily on the bottom sill that's pretty much it.
HomeImprovement,"Yeah it felt like it was a very high estimate, I'm contacting other contractors but I was hoping to have a better idea of pricing for when they come out to give estimates. "
HomeImprovement,Around 36 x 48 if I remember correctly 
iamverysmart,If you intend to run I would hope you intend to succeed...
kpop,"Ok that makes sense, I guess I got the wrong impression from ARMY online.

*beneath xyz groups video*
""ARMY here, they may be good but we have THE Golden Makne."""
kpop,"People need to stop excusing idols shitty behavior with ""well they're from Korea they don't know"" or looking the other way because that's my bias. 
1. They have seen their peers get reamed for shit like blackface.
2. The internet exists, stupidity is not a right, I don't care how talented you are. 

EXO feels manufactured and I kind of don't understand how they're still together.

""Well if they were really meant to be famous-"" there are other factors at work, don't act like music shows and other media don't push certain groups.

BTS doesn't have a lot of ""unwarranted hate"" their new stuff is meh and it baffles people how much attention it's getting. They are not Gods.

Jooheon's aegyo makes me want to crawl out of my skin.

I don't understand how Jungkook got the label ""golden makne"" when maknes like Taemin exist.

I want to like girl groups but the childish image they're forced to adopt makes me feel gross.

Produce 101 shows and temporary groups are mistakes.

**I just want to say I wouldn't bother criticizing these things if I didn't care about them. I like BTS/EXO/Monsta X and I enjoy the temporary groups but watching them end is tough."
kpop,"The fact that BTS broke into the US with DNA ALWAYS felt so plastic to me. They peaked at BS&T and now ARMY along with western media is trying to shove them down our throats. I liked them, Spring Day was amazing, but their rabid fanbase along with their plastic americanized music ruined them for me. The only ""good"" song on this new album is the first 50 seconds of Love Maze."
ucla,So you're right I see the silver buttons but they're springloaded and keep popping back out. Do I just enlist a friend or is there a trick I'm missing.
mildlyinteresting,sawed-off double barrel banana 
AskReddit,Mass Effect 3. Fuck you Kai Leng. And fuck you in particular Illusive Man.
politics,Ever since he got into office it's like it's raining goddamn shoes.
personalfinance,Thanks for the quick response!! I'll look into those options
personalfinance,"I had a court blocked account with 50,000 dollars in it when I was a minor, I recently got the account released (with interest it's now at ~68k). I want to know the best way to put this money into savings. Is there a bank that's best for accumulating interest, should I go to an online bank, put it on a CD etc. I will not be touching this money for at least ten years if that helps."
raisedbynarcissists,"It's not selfish of you at all, you're just left wishing everyone would play by the same strict rules you were forced to. It's selfish of your mom to thrust all of her forgiveness onto one child and neglect the other. Another way of looking at this could be you aren't burdened with having to worry about your sister, you are free to be 100% responsible for yourself and only yourself. Your feelings are valid."
raisedbynarcissists,"She must have some deeper self esteem issues because in her mind she's directly in competition with you when it comes to your father. Instead of protecting you like we'd expect out of a traditional mother her mind is consumed with one-upping you and villainizing you for any of your percieved ""wins"". I'm sorry she wasn't able to fill her role as a mother as you surely needed her to."
raisedbynarcissists,If you have concrete proof that she has an actual plan I would call now. I would also mention the self harm scars and that she's on medication that seems to not be helping. I'm afraid that she may try to talk her way out of it if you call prematurely but when someone starts planning it is a major cause for concern that needs immediate attention.
raisedbynarcissists,"They will not judge you and there is no wrong thing to say. Just tell them the truth they are there to help you and they are completely on your side. They are YOUR resource and it is your right as a patient to take every bit of advantage of that. Even if it feels like it's not a good fit, you will find someone who will be able to take you through the process of healing and in the meantime you have us."
