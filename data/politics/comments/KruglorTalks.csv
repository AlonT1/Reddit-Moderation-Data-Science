Alberto Gonzalez was cut down before formal nomination because he was considered a political crony to Bush. (Texan and white house counsel) Not only that, but there was a lot of pressure to nominate another woman. Laura Bush even echoed the sentiment so they had to keep looking. 

Harriet Miers dropped because she was also political crony that even Republicans hated. She also let her law license lapse and might have been unqualified. She withdrew herself to avoid shame.

Bush *finally* nominated Alito because both sides of the senate told Bush to stop looking around the oval office for Supreme Court justices. It was honestly one of W. Bush's worst qualities, that he would elevate people he knew rather than those who were qualified."

Libertarian,"In 2016 libertarians were still the group youre probably familiar with. Alyhough many voted for Johnson, most were at least open to Trump's platform. (A meme here was libertarians saying he was 'the most libertarian option') 

Since then there has been a full blow schism. Libertarians that liked Trump became full blown red caps. Whats left in the LP is a more symathatic voter base and a stronger focus on social issues, or restraining the executive power. This is reflective on our nominee, Jo Jorgensen. As one example, she was still anti-welfare, but advised we not ""remove crutches before the healing begins"" and deprioritize going after social programs. As another, current LP voters were supportive of protestors this summer, whereas the redcap converts saw them as an excuse to shoot people for minor damage to private property.

Ron Paul dreamed of a libertarian faction within the Republican party. Those dreams are pretty dead at this point."
Libertarian,">Watch Biden flounder his way fighting a collapsing economy and far left elements in his party and then take the House in the midterms.

Thats always plausible but thats not really relevant to the point at hand. Democrat branding was terrible this election cycle, yet they managed to win the presidency anyway. In that same vein, Republican cohesion *could* collapse and they could still gain if Biden does terrible. Thats always plausible. However, we are discussing is if the GOP will make it harder for themselves by breaking into factions. 

>The only decision the GOP needs to make is whether they want to continue with populist economic policies or go back to being supporters of free trade etc.

Youre totally burying the culture war segments of it. Plus I think youre kidding yourself if you think the current conservative movement is driven by trade policy. When Florida votes republican but votes for a 15$ minimum wage, its pretty clear that leftist/right policy isnt what gives the winning edge. Marijuana laws in red states are also a major convergence from the party platform. Right now the strategy to win votes is to say ""we dont like the liberals as people"" but that messaging only works when the big bad libs are well defined. In this case, ""the left"" becomes anyone not a Trump supporter. Makes it nice and easy for the masses. If this element breaks down, then the GOP will risk inconsistent messaging. 

Again, they can still win despite all that, but Im wargaming against a moderately average Democrat government."
Libertarian,"100%. It was less than 24 hours after news orgs declared Biden the winner when progressives and moderates started to turn on each other.

Libertarian,"The conditions arent quite the same as 2009 Obama. When he took office, the bank bailouts were underway and he expanded them further. The tea party movement got started and the Occupy Wallstreet fiasco came soon after. All of these things were rhetorical gains for the GOP to change its brand from warhawking to an economic focus. McCain was defeated partly because the US was tired of expanding Middle East conflicts. (Hindsight though, right?) 

Right now the GOP brand is in shambles. They literally, no exaggeration, dont have a 2020 platform. Its all Trump focused. If Trump doesnt go away, then the party is at a huge risk for an identity crisis."

Youre trying to say that antifa are on the same level as organized white supremacy groups. Your justification is that both groups have had incidents of violence, therefore they are the same. Im telling you that any incident of violence doesnt automatically invalidate a whole movement. 

If your only argument is ""violence bad"" then Id like to hear you reconcile your views on the 2nd ammendment or the Revolutionary war. Also Id be curious on how you feel about MLK's quote of ""a riot is the language of the unheard.""

*""Urban riots must now be recognized as durable social phenomena. They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community. They are a distorted form of social protest. The looting which is their principal feature serves many functions. It enables the most enraged and deprived Negro to take hold of consumer goods with the ease the white man does by using his purse. Often the Negro does not even want what he takes; he wants the experience of taking.”*

Libertarian,"> No antifa gathering? Are you serious? Let me guess its just an idea? 

Who is generally considered the leader of the Proud Boys movement? Who is generally considered the leader of the Antifa movement? Thats your ""why its just an idea"" argument. 

I think a lot of us have an issue with Antifa being held up to the same level as white supremacy because thats what the Republican party wants us to do. The mainstream right wants people to think that bigotry is a simple partisan spectrum where we have to waive away the ""crazies on both sides."" It gives them an easy out to a problem they don't want to address. Reality is that its not a both sides thing. The problems from each group is different. The dangers they pose are different.

What happens is, maybe 80% of the time, is that a post sits on rising for a while, doesnt get any reports, then when it hits the front page it booms up in votes.

Oh no people exist! Zoning out dense residential won't solve this problem. It makes it worse. Youre describing a macro issue here and pretending its micro. Stastically speaking, your dense American suburb isn't getting flooded with outsiders. More likely is that your surrounding population is growing and expanding out. Having many single family homes with more people in them makes traffic and commuter problems worse. Its not like 50K flood out of one apartment complex and jam the highway at once going to their 9-5. 

>Not every neighborhood is made for large houses, or apartments. 

Technically true but most neighborhoods started as two streets in the wilderness. You can change and adapt them over time. Im not the ""abolish all zoning laws"" guy but justifying NIMBY-ism because your commute sucks is a terrible reason to block out thousands of families of affordable housing. 

>A lot of people want to come to their calm neighborhood after a long day of work.

Libertarian,Wrong. If property is an investment then there is risk. That cost is a lost of investment and the government does not need to protect one investment vs another.
Libertarian,Equity is such a terrible justification. I can use that for almost anything to justify government intervention. That doesnt translate to other areas at all.

And even then corp wars are still pretty primitive, both sides just smashing cruisers into each other in declared battles. Bubbles and scrambles are going to help players stacking emulators the most.  Developers need to hit the abort button on this roadmap and work on diversifying income methods. All this is does is make travel harder when the two main forms of income require copious jumping."

Libertarian,">Is welfare something that would be eliminated? Or just reformed?

There is no agreed upon answer to this. We fight all the time about it. For what its worth, Jo Jorgensen has said to the effect that ""we cant remove the crutches before someone has healed."" Ive seen a lot of LP members deprioritize welfare reduction this election cycle. It doesnt mean they dont want to do it. Its just that there are bigger issues that seem to exist to most of us. 

In my (minority) opinion, Im not worried about giving people welfare and Ive started supporting government health care for an assortment of reasons. However I wish voters better considered the consequences of certain government programs, such as inflating markets, dependency and political abuse. I seriously hate the ""just tax the rich more its easy"" attitude."
Libertarian,"> Is he wrong saying the democrats aren't negotiating in good faith. Also yes.

Ya know I'm not going to both sides this one. Democrats are doing the kind of slap fighting that has been around for decades upon decades. Slap an insulting pork. Put on a measure that will get removed when it bounces between chambers. Say some shit that will catch a headline. Thats whatever. 

This is straight up holding citizens and their tax money hostage for their vote. Imagine if FDR said he would only end war time rationing if they elected him to another term. This is insane."

Libertarian,"> And do you have a rebuttal for the “no roads, schools, fire departments” argument?

Thats basically a meme to us. Thats like saying ""Can God make a boulder he can't push?! BOOM! PARADOX! CHECKMATE CHRISTIANS!"" 

If your only interaction with libertarian ideas is a subreddit then yes, you're going to see plenty of people saying ""Private services only!!1"" Those people are delusional. The LP and most of its followers want drastic cutbacks on things that are actually a major drain of resources. Military, police, welfare, ect. There are *tons* of disagreement on how much to cutback and where, but nearly all of us agree that completely dissolving public government is anarchy and not libertarian. 

An example of this is on schools. Instead of dissolving them, you will see the LP push more on the subject school choice and reduce federal regulations on education."
Libertarian,"In 2016 the Libertarians were pretty well split over ""is Trump a libertarian candidate."" It seems like now that the divide is pretty much completed.

However, having merch, a logo, food and water doesnt mean youre a nationally organized or even well coordinated militia lol. I live in Baltimore. You wanna know why we havent been a rioting hell hole this year? Because after 2015 our protest groups actually got organized. Set plans. Leaders. Liaisons to government. Set standards. People just setting a schedule and bringing amenities only takes about a dozen people and it takes less for it to go off the rails.  

The fact is that the term ANTIFA is not much different than alt-right was in 2016-17. A loosely used umbrella term for various ideas or groups. The biggest difference is that now you have a government using it to scare voters so they can retain power."
Libertarian,Correct. Thats what happens when unorganized mobs run around. Framing such a thing as a coordinated leftist movement is just a scare tactic from your government.
Libertarian,ANTIFA is a facebook group at best.
Libertarian,"> My suspicion is that he thinks that effective tax rate looks good for him compared to Trump.

I doubt he is paying taxes in 2019 just to peacock the against the right. That requires a level of clairvoyance that I'm not willing to give to Biden. Think of it more practically. If you're 70 years old and you come into money, the best way to protect it from taxes is through some expense or some investment. He can't do it in expenses because of the campaign. He has no incentive to invest and his remaining kids have their own revenues. So the third option is pay the tax on it and enjoy the liquid cash with no restrictions. Biden also recently bought a large ""vacation home"" in Delaware. Good for him. Like I'm 30 and I know that would be irresponsible for me, but if I'm almost 80 and I finally got a bunch of money? Fuck it whats a 30% tax matter to me? I'll go the shore and hangout till I die. My family is fine so whatever. 

So in summary, yes. If you heavily manage your money you an avoid taxes. If you don't bother, 30% is a completely normal tax rate."
Libertarian,"Right but what are your income streams and where are putting that money? That's rhetorical for you, but in comparing it to how Biden makes his money then it makes sense.

His income is largely speaking fees and book sales while his wife makes under 100K in her salary. Sure he could probably do better (there is almost no 2019 charitable giving, as one example) but besides declaring everything he does as a business expense (hard to do when his campaign was probably already doing that) why would he do much planning? He's already old and otherwise retired so fuck long term investments based around tax planning. Plus almost all of it his new money for him. (Networth under a million when elected as VP in 2008.) If you're getting your income in large riskless payments, another entity is claiming your actions as expenses, you're already getting a 45K refund and you're not investing for the future then fuck it. Keep the money as cash and just take the tax."
BigBrother,"Disagree. A double is the best time to chuck Dani with minimal drama. Anyone not named Dani, Nicole or Cody will recognize this. Mephis debatable."
Libertarian,"If he just has basic incomes and doesnt try to hide cash, then thats about right. Your accountant doesnt find magic boxes to check that save you money. You have to be actively shifting and allocating your money to do that."
Libertarian,"This 100%. Its hard to discuss this because on the r8ght you get ""well so what we all avoid taxes"" and on the left you get a morality discussion.

Libertarian,Or maybe he is just a misguided neolib. Drop the hyperbole.

The US vessel export of natural gas has grown dramatically during Trumps term, and most of that growth is to central Europe. Opposing the pipeline from Russia to Germany is arguably more a stance against Europe getting a cheaper source of gas which would undercut a growing US market. Therefore, it doesnt really count as ""standing against Russia"" if the only time Trump does it is when there is an immediate financial gain.

neoliberal,"More for the purpose of clarifying positions rather than arguing new ones:

> That's funny. The politicians who represent you guys definitely use it. Talk about goalpost shifting. Even more interestingly, why do you not identify as what you vote for?

Its not that there isn't an identity. Its that the ""identity"" isn't self-perceived in the same way as others. It's not too unlike insulting all Christians at once. Like if you say ""liberals are stupid"" I'm probably going to say ""what kind of liberal?"" Like when a conservative or such uses the term liberal as a slur, its pretty clear they just need a word for ""people not like us."" 

>Maybe, but I doubt it. If you did, you would remove the snark.

Haha nope. My wife hates it. 

>Fuck his apology that was preceded by his defense of his fuckup.

You don't have to accept his apology. You're totally entitled to think its bullshit. You just have to acknowledge that you were wrong that the current democratic presidential platform is ""doubling down"" on that crime bill. They're clearly against it and, in my own opinion, you're allowed to change your mind once every 25 years. Actually maybe more than once, but some people won't even allow that, it seems.

>In breaking news, the NYTimes got Trump's tax returns. No Russian collusion.

For the record, that wasn't the ""Russian collusion"" argument. The main bulwark of it wasn't ""he got paid by Russia"" and even it is was no one on the planet expected him to list Russian Government funds as an income. It was and always is 'Russia pushed information campaigns and coordinated with members of the Trump campaign team."" Income tax has nothing to do with that. What his returns *do* show is Trump reporting that he was losing a ton of liquidable assets in the runup to the presidency, and that he has hundreds of millions in loans coming due in the next 5 years."

You can see from this sub that the identity of neoliberal isnt taken too seriously, even if the issues are. ""Liberals"" dont try and rehabilitate their image because its not one they personally use. Making it a slur is just good ol' identity politics at work. 

Also dont build up a fake straw man to make you feel morally superior. Id absolutely say this stuff to your face.

neoliberal,">I remember the rastas who were cleaning up the crushed crack vials, running the drug dealers off the block, raising money for the funerals when stick up boys were shooting it out with the dealers.

Oh look! He can speak to some issues! See when you stay focused you can actually build up an argument people want to engage in.

>But do go on explaining to white folks how they were right for putting a shit ton of black folks in jail over some bullshit. Your intellectual forebears enthusiastically cosigned locking up people who needed help. Many black people didn't fuck with them - those politicians, I mean. They called them uncle tom's, sellouts and a whole lot worse.

I specifically said ""grade on a curve"" not ""the bill was great."" There were lots of issues that people highlighted then. Some people did want to relax/end the war on drugs and more social services, but youre being highly revisionist to think that was the majority. Lots of Americans blamed guns, drugs and gangs. A lot of black people blamed those things. Decriminalization of drugs was a fringe opinion. There are still groups of black people in cities today who think Trump should roll through their neighborhood in tanks and pickup all the no good young people causing problems. 

You want to argue that the crime bill is bad, go for it. You want to point out all the racist results that came from it, thats good too. But there is a difference between racist and wrong, and when a candidate realizes mistakes then you should be recognizing them and the context which that mistake was made."

Yeaaaa youre in the wrong decade, mate. In the 80s and early 90s gang violence was fucking nuts. Back then the problem wasnt ""police overstepping."" It was the police just not showing up because certain parts of a city were straight up abandoned. Americans wanted a big heavy hand against crime and POC went along with it because they wanted *any* hand against crime. Politicians found an easy win by being ""tough on crime"" but after 30 years these laws kept growing and growing. The enforcement wasnt fair and ""being tough on crime"" ended up being tough on poor black people in general. 

Black communities begged for tough gun laws and funded police departments because many of us remember a time where the police just didnt fucking show up at all. If you want to rate any politician from the 90s for their strong crime laws, then you need to grade on a curve. The police didnt get this powerful for no reason."

Oh boy. General rule of thumb. If you don't have a focused point and instead just have a stream of random thoughts, odds you're uninformed and don't know it. You probably think ""wow no one debates me I'm always right."" In reality, you just chucked out seven different issues ranging from 30 years of context and smashed them together. I and others can't spend all fucking day troubleshooting your loose, uncoordinated opinions for you. Like what am I supposed to do with all this jibberish?

Libertarian,Youre telling me that these people are trained to kill in situations that I would say do not warrent killing or appropriate use of lethal force. If theyre literally trained to kill people are not lethal threats then its a premeditated execution. You cant argue that it isnt but also argue that their standards are being followed.
Libertarian,">He was drunk enough to pass out in a Wendy's drivethrough.

He was barely over the legal limit. Its in the bodycam when they give him a breathalyzer. He was coherant enough to answer questions. He didnt jump the officers. They move to arrest him and he resists and tries to run. 

>Taser cartridges have 2 shots. He turned to fire and the officer immediately pulled and fired. 

Its not semi-automatic common. Also its a non-lethal weapon. (Non lethal for thee, not for me!) Also its over his shoulder mid run. The suspect doesnt turn around, take a firing stance and shoot. Officer dodges a wild shot and takes firing stance. Blam blam.

>The manual for those officers specifically says lethal force can be used to respond to a suspect's lethal OR incapacitating force.

Yea thats still not ok. Just because the cops say their own actions are justified doesnt mean we should accept their own standard. 

>If your standard for police doesn't allow them to return fire, its a bad standard.

Shooting people running away who you screwed up detaining is a bad standard but what do I know. The only thing thst officer did right was land his shots, and thats pretty telling to how their training works."
Libertarian,">Just formalized, purposive.

Give it a second....

>That doesn’t change anything here, because valid self-defense is always intentional.

There ya go. Its formalized.

 Saying ""self defense"" implies that the culprit is a confirmed immediate threat. Im saying its execution because lethal force is justified in the instant on how the officer feels, and not to the truth of the situation. This is a lower standard than you or I need to meet in using lethal force.

 The worst examples of these are when suspects are executed for disobedience rather than actually posing a confirmed threat."
Libertarian,"Yea, the one where a barely drunk guy escaped two officers on top of him who lost their taser, only for it be blind fired over his shoulder while he ran away. Then the officer, in a populated drivethru, knowing the culprit had expended the taser cartridge, while still having the car/identifying information of the culprit, fired shots into his back. 

Just admit that the punishment for resisting arrest should be execution and your defense will work better

Libertarian,"Because the facts of the instance dont matter compared to how the officer feels. If the officer feels in danger they can shoot, regardless of their actual danger or if they precipitate the threat."
Libertarian,It doesnt need to be ritualized. Take a bunch of people to a ditch and shoot them and its an execution. If its sanctioned by the state and trained into our enforcement officers then its an execution. The same condition applies for premeditated murder.

You have also now combined libertarians and neoliberal ideologies. What the hell"
BigBrother,Im out this week. Its over.
SubredditDrama,I wanna also point out that your examples are pretty strawman-ey but I want to do with a lot less cringe than the other guy
BigBrother,The change is that it gets canceled
BigBrother,The show is rigged against popular fan favorites because TV executives are notorious for hating good ratings and lots of money.
BigBrother,From fucking Chima of all people makes this.
BigBrother,"Week 1: Wow David is such a dumbass.

Week 7: Wow David is such a legend."
BigBrother,"My read was that David didn't find it productive to drag other castmembers because it wasn't his style. He basically said as much. Then twitter shit on him, raised Kemi up to infallible queen status, and David backtracked."
BigBrother,Its prob just a guest for an event that will let a twist in. There is usually a late-game twist about now.
BigBrother,Good gameplay is boring. There is a reason David is so interesting
BigBrother,"Did we hate Kaycee? She was basically unnoticed in the first half of her season so she came off as a boring alliance goon but eventually she came into her own. 

Holly was a wet blanket that complained all the time."
BigBrother,Youll still have time zones for TV theyll just call it different hours.
Libertarian,"A level of pressure? From Joe Rogan? The guy who infamously lets his guests ramble on unimpeded? Are you kidding me? 

JRE fan boys dont know that other media exists."
BigBrother,Because Dani and Nicole were influencing Christmas before noms. Tyler hadnt clued Christmas into the house turning on Dani and he didnt want look suspicious by suddenly pushing for Christmas' ally.
BigBrother,If she had a car in the house she woulda tried to run over Tyler.
BigBrother,Holy shit Derrick is orchestrating 6 weeks of big brother perfectly!!!! What a champ!
BigBrother,No. Worst twist ever
echoes,Imagine a doorman to a bar who also robs people who pass by. The fact that he is a bouncer becomes pretty irrelevant to the robbing.
echoes,"At what point does this not count as ""security"" and more like 12 guys waiting for isk balloons to show up to pop."
echoes,"Sounds like you had bad visuals but you were still caught on right edge of jumping. FYI the Heron in the worst of the covert ops frigates. The Heron has low velocity, the highest signature radius. The Probe is faster, has a smaller signature radius base and a bonus to reducing it further. Your Heron is way more like to get caught an auto pilot whereas a Probe might take 4-6 seconds just to be locked on to."
echoes,Im prob gonna quit if bubbles work the same as EO. Like ok I get cutting out saftey for all ships in auto pilot. You cant have T7 ships just running around unimpeded. But I need to just let my frigates run around because theyre mostly carrying my own self or small bullshit around space. Im watching null grow right now and at this pace its just going to be a pvp playground with no economy.
echoes,Its the picking up of contracts that gets me. I like hauling. I hate refreshing endlessly.
echoes,20$ says the hauler didnt realize they couldn't fit it in their ship lol
echoes,"On the probe? Its 3 warp core stabs and thats it unless I want to put the cloak on. The covert ops lowers its signature radius and increases freight with its skill bonus. This means my lock size is less than a capsule despite a 2300m cargo hold, so I shouldnt ever get caught auto piloting while moving small buckets of loot around."
echoes,"The Imicus is no longer worth it. I have a Nerus that I use around hisec which is fine for when I need a change-of-pace day. I usually mine in nullsec and sometimes Id rather just be more afk. 

I can take nullsec items in my probe covert-ops but I only do that if I either a) accidentally take that contract or b) the payout is stupid crazy."
echoes,"I almost never pick those up unless the payout is stupid high. I see some of these dink and dunk orders and I'm like ""yo just take a slasher out here and get it yourself"" haha"
echoes,"Have you tried to collect cargo? Its competitive. You basically have to take whatever without reading it or else someone else takes it. That said, I completed a 1.6 mil payout today that was only 4 jumps, but that was extraordinarily rare. Right now I'm doing my ""leftover"" deliveries, the last 4-5 stops where I couldn't efficiently stack them. These are almost valueless stops that I could just dump into space without thinking but I don't want to be a jerkass to the people who bought them."
BigBrother,"I also agree with what has been mentioned in podcasts and such, where even if you have the same amount of white people, they need to have different backgrounds. Too many of these early 20's suburban types are on the show and its clear that their diversity experiences are pretty slim."
BigBrother,"They could have had numbers, but they lacked coordination, suspected each other and didnt use one of their HoH's well. Remember that L6 lost two allies in prejury, so you can't pretend that there was any sort of steamroll or domination compared to other seasons."
BigBrother,Foutte had the numbers and won comps. They were just bad.
BigBrother,David v Mephis final is what dreams are made of.
BigBrother,"Irc you get bonuses at top 5, though this season may ne different. Last I heard they were negligible compared to the top prize, a few thousand dollars, but its a small incentive to not just throw your hands up at 6th or 7th."
echoes,Yea. It sucks. Oh well. Does the crate just go poof or does it open?
echoes,I got a delivery package too big for me by accident. Is it just RIP my collateral? I don't have adv lv 5 frieght yet to open it. Does the package dissappear after 24 hrs?
BigBrother,"I dont think Cody likes or wants Dani around, and he can work well with Tyler. Its easier to take out someone like him when there are less total votes. No matter who Tyler is up against, with extra votes and extra agendas, a player like him could flip the vote his way."
BigBrother,Last one just helped Cody.
BigBrother,Enzo has to be putting out crap here. It really doesnt matter who goes out this week. Dani will overplay and overstress her game to all her friends regardless of what the outcome is. I dont see a world where Dani stays for long.
BigBrother,This is what happens when people just enable you. They keep enabling her want to focus Tyler but they dont mean it.
echoes,I would use a strike cannon and orbit at max distance. Avoid webifiers.
BigBrother,"The key is that as long as your not an actual monster, people forget about you in 5 months"
Libertarian,The only 2A concept Trump supports is for his own supporters to carry a plain AR15 to brandish at liberals.
BigBrother,Ok thats *checks notes* one vote.
BigBrother,"Its plausible that they take out Tyler while the opportunity is there, but yesterday Cody/Nicole were talking about ousting Kevin and how Dani wasnt a great ally. Thats kind of a crap shoot on how such a vote goes."
BigBrother,Dont be 100% that Tyler goes.
BigBrother,"Sixth with 11 people left!! Thats totally ""got your back"" material right there! 

The perspective youve described is called ""disposable."""
BigBrother,"Atm no because who can you put her up against? Maybe her and Cody but thats a veto risk with retaliation from everyone the next week. A lot of people are focusing on Dani to wedge out her leverage, and it will also depend on where Day really falls for loyalty."
BigBrother,Lmao no. Shes just not a target for her HoH. Thats all. Shes with Nicole and Cody for a final 3.
BigBrother,I mean any hotel will do that for you FYI. Most hotels for weddings though arent all inclusive resorts
BigBrother,Ehhhhhhh
BigBrother,Im def not a root for underdog kind of guy but this is lind of rediculous.
BigBrother,"I think they added more elements to make it harder, like obstacles or not traditional olds. This one is a pretty classic setup"
BigBrother,These can take 2-3 hours on average
BigBrother,I could take a Tyler HoH after this actually lol
BigBrother,"100%. I mean, its pretty shitty but damn I swear people think the problematic stuff only started in 2015."
BigBrother,Yes
BigBrother,This whole affair was about 18 hours.
BigBrother,Yall want to talk about Tyler's point of view and game moves but give Christmas some credit. I think she guided Tyler's mindset more than we want to admit.
BigBrother,Dragging her down? Hey did you miss the Amazing Race?
BigBrother,Christmas unusually loyal to her other people and doing their bidding?!?! *IM SHOCKED I TELL YOU!! SHCOCKED!!*
BigBrother,I bought a fuckton of Christmas stock that was looking like I stole from the monopoly bank until last night.
BigBrother,Maybe? Its hard to really tell.
SubredditDrama,Not now dude COVID
BigBrother,Christmas's conduct was bad but her logic was good. Bay is a bad juror and not well bonded to Christmas or her real allies. Day is a soft target and would have likely worked to save Bay if off the block. She shouldnt put up Tyler because it burns her HoH and Bay would want still want revenge for going up. Plus Christmas was never clued into Dani being a target early on so she want an option.
BigBrother,Trending #19 in a category. Not a major trend lol
BigBrother,Yes it is? Its when you justify or minimize the actions of one person by naming another's misdeeds. Either you were doing that here or you brought up Christmas for no reason.
BigBrother,Youre doing whataboutism yet no one disagrees
BigBrother,"I think she feels as though if she retreats to the HoH she ""loses"" or is hiding. So this is like a ""pft Im not gonna run"" sort of thing."
BigBrother,Well yea the house guests are literally saying that shouting reflects on your race or racism so yea. It sometimes feels as though if I defend the content of Christmas' argument that Im supporting microaggressions.
BigBrother,Not on the subreddit but on Twitter it sure is. I just got off there and damn. You could have sworn Day was physically destroying a KKK leader by those reactions.
BigBrother,">Christmas & Bayleigh screaming:

Day and Christmas fighting is messy. Lots of communication breakdown and speaking for other people with the classic BB he said she said. 

The Bay one is dumb. After this fight with David, Bay complains that she cant raise her voice but its not about her volume. Its about interrupting with ""you dont get to play victim."" You can whisper that, you can shout that, doesnt matter. Thats an attack in that conversation. Theyre both supposedly ""calming down"" to hash out their feelings but you cant do that by completely invalidating the other person the moment they start speaking. Or at least dont go bragging about calm you were and how they started it."
BigBrother,"Enzo has ""out at 4th"" vibes to me."
BigBrother,Hes been pushing Dani for two weeks now.
BigBrother,Nuance?! Context?! Empathy? Dude fuck off with that we dont use it here!!
BigBrother,"Theyll never be outright sued, but CBS could charge backfees for services rendered. Odds are, if the PR would be bad, they just would withhold stipends."

neoliberal,I mean killing the baby is gebnerally pretty easy.
BigBrother,Kind if weird for you to just write off the stats when you have two winners.
BigBrother,Hahaha yall bought all this Tyler stock but I put almost everything on Christmas
BigBrother,Me. I've always been this way. You can root for someone but not emotionally invest in them.
BigBrother,"As much as I complain that this season is a really poor example of microaggresions, previous seasons are and casting has been bad and created underlaying issues that are still seen here.

Like you cant keep casting a bunch of white 20-somethings of similar backgrounds and not expect them to all group together. Even if the cast is mostly white, you can find diversity in many ways. Income, sexuality, professions, age, culture ect."
BigBrother,No lol Terms of Service exist common man
BigBrother,This wall yeller really mucked up their shout.
BigBrother,"Lol ""be nice"" gets downvotes."
BigBrother,He didnt throw her under anything. He just let the bus roll and not push back. He also kept Christmas out of the Dani loop.
BigBrother,"FYI Bay and Tyler have talked before how ""fans"" have attacked each cast member. By my own super-duper accurate anecdotal information (/s) it really seems pretty bias one way of Bay fans attacking Tyler and Angela. I think the stress of reliving his BB20 season and knowing the online bullshit waiting for him again is probably what is the mental tipping point for him."
BigBrother,">EDIT: Also this. Racial bias doesn't mean that B and D aren't or haven't ever been aggressive, it means that B and D can't be as aggressive as white houseguests without being perceived as disproportionately more sassy/aggressive. 

This loses the plot to me. 

Bay does have a history of taking every game move as some sort of personal attack against her family honor. She is lashing out left and right and Christmas was basically *correct* in pointing out that offending Bay risked being yelled at. (God knows shes already done it to Tyler, Ian and Kevin thusfar, all while bragging to others that she can poison a jury.) 

And so what that Christmas got charged with a misdemeanor. What she said wasnt in the context of ""what happens when you cheat on our baby daddies."" The context was what happens when someone makes a game action against them."
BigBrother,"I think there is some rose color glasses for nostalgia. Like, yea it was batshit crazy but there is no universe where that season survives today. Like the absolute collapse of the pre-jury twists, problamatic winner, fucky HOH competition, ect. Like the drama was high tier but the game was absolutely in the trash. 

Like for me BB needs its drama intertwined with the game. Otherwise I might as well just watch whatever reality drama is on TLC."
BigBrother,"BB9. Its almost unforgivable. Like its bad start to finish.  BB19 was dull to watch but it had a good narrative and a satisfying ending. (If you rewatch it its actually not so terrible because you dont need to wait weeks to get through predictable outcomes.) BB21 actually has some really great gameplay. The real problem is that the casting feels like some of the worst, laziest decisions ever. Like it could have been a good season if it didnt feel like ""OOPS ALL VILLIANS"" most of the time."
BigBrother,"People saying there is a game move for Bay to fail, but keep in mind that some people may not want her in jury."
BigBrother,Prob yes and no. A transcript rarely conveys tone well so certain houseguests can come off as assholes in certain situations. I don't know if BB\_Updates tries to make people look bad so much as they try to get reactions.
BigBrother,I was being sarcastic
SubredditDrama,"Im not wasting my time on this complete side discussion that involves the etymology of ""snowflake."" Lets make a deal. I give you an upvote provided you fuck off."
BigBrother,Basically the question is.... why?

SubredditDrama,"Its the part where she responds with old alt-right Trump tropes from 2016. Like you can say ""fuck you"" without yelling all the ""snowflake MAGA TRUMP 2020"" slogans like a trained monkey. Otherwise it makes the OP comment seem correct."
neoliberal,Austria is tons of fun. Underrated nation that I think people dont want to play because main nations are percieved as boring with no challenge.  Small gains are super satisfying.
BigBrother,Shes playing it up with her group. No way. She connects too well with Tyler and would prefer if her friends went after him.
SubredditDrama,"I get where youre coming from, I mean the top comment isnt exactly a friendly outreach, but that doesnt justify going into full 2016 cringe trope material."
BigBrother,Exactly! Christmas was absolutely rediculous to think this. Bay has been nothing but calm and collected over this whole situation!!!! How could anyone think shes aggressive after last night?!?!
SubredditDrama,"Ya know, I read top comment and I was like ""ahh common dont be doing that. Its just a picture put the politics down."" Then this happend

BigBrother,This.
BigBrother,"""Do I try to win or do I write Anallice because hahaha"""
Libertarian,">Recklessness might indeed be relevant, but would require actions, not mere presence.

I mean I understand this and agree, but the prosecution is going to argue that his presence will count as series of relevant actions leading up to the shooting. It's not exactly like Kyle was walking down his own street minding his business. ""Intent"" has been proved before on these same general arguments.

Look, I'm not saying this is 100% easy to prove and a slam dunk case. Massie is a fucking moron to just blurt this out as ""solved."" All I'm doing right now, though, is replying to is when you say things this from a few posts back:

\> It's all about who initiated the violence.

That line alone is just not true. It is entirely possible to create scenarios where someone attacks you first but you illegally used deadly force. In this case I think reckless homicide is going to be a strong charge, although I believe the DA wants to charge 1st degree on the first homicide. That seems like a high bar to try and convince a jury of premeditation, but they certainly have an argument for it."
Libertarian,"""Illegal"" in this sense would mean anything illegal which is in direct connection to the crime at hand, for instance taking a firearm and illegally wielding it in a state or jurisdiction that he cant have it in. Any curfew violation alone would not be the case here.

Now there are examples of people legally using guns for self defense while owning that gun illegally, but all of those cases involve the person not intentionally putting themselves in danger. (Being robbed/assaulted/ect.) Kyle illegally taking a gun to a place that he knows is dangerous could be determined as creating a reckless/escalating situation, which might then in turn make him criminally liable for all other homicides. Theres more at hand, but that is an example on how the law doesnt determine legal use of lethal force just by asking ""ok who started it."""
Libertarian,"""You can only have rights if you behave"""
Libertarian,">shooting is justified.

That is not how it works, no. 

That might be a scenario on how it works based on *certain criteria* but you cant shoot anyone at anytine just because they started it. Doubly so if the court decides Kyle's presence was illegial and reckless."
Libertarian,">Idk actually, if i shot someone, and then run away, and then people chase me for the very obvious reason that I have just shot someone, based on just that do I have the right to kill the people chasing me?

If the prosecution can determine that the situation you created was reckless or the force you used was unjustified, then yes. 100%. It also depends on the charges levied per case. More goes into a self defense case than ""he started it."""
Libertarian,Yes if I saw that happened I would realize that theyre just trying to save face rather than admit to something embarassing that they shouldnt have been doing hahahaha. I mean this isnt exactly social rocket science here.
BigBrother,"Big Brother has had a representation problem for a while, however I think our exploration of the problem has created a new issue, where all circumstances get bathed in issued of race. 

Like I cant imagine the stress that a POC might have in the house. Social media is focused on you, cameras in every corner, knowing that you were brought on the show at least in some part as a diversity candidate... (casting could never justify a 'its a coincidence the whole cast is white' argument.) Thats really an extra weight to carry along with the rest of the nonsense of the show. The black women especially express how they seem burdened by not wanting to fill the stereotype of being an ""angry black woman."" 

Like Bay is a competitor. She *does* get aggressive, almost exclusively when she is losing in parts of the game. And good for her. Shes a fighter who wants to win and thats not a bad thing at all. But I wonder if this is why some POC struggle, not because of microaggressions or flagrant racisim, but because they feel as though they have to hold themselves back or adjust their personalities to avoid being stereotyped."

BigBrother,But..... Dani cant and half the house turned on her for that very reason.... what are you people talking about

Dont get me wrong. Im fully on board for all the casting issues. BB21 was terrible with that. But when it comes to game mechanics a lot of yall need to just enjoy the show as a whole season rather than demanding crazy flips every monday.

Besides, every season has dragging weeks. Every one. Even the ones you deify as the ""best ever."" Just wait. There are 100 knives out right now on this cast and some of you refuse to see it because Janelle and Kaser will be gone."

BigBrother,Nicole won. Twitter confirms.
Libertarian,">We're all just discussing our opinions here and very few of us have the background in law

I can tell.

>He might get off on self-defense. 

Self defense is in the fucking garbage. Half the sub is discussing who was the aggressor, what kind of force, blah blah blah. That **barely matters.** 

There are certain qualifiers to justifying lethal force. In fact, its entirely probable for a scenario to exist where someone comes up and kicks the shit out of you, and if you shot them you would be a murderer. 

In this case, Kyle created a reckless, dangerous situation. If the weapon was illegally wielded, then any
specific legislation protecting him in WI goes out the window. If his first shots are deemed to be reckless and criminal, then anything that follows is his responsibility. If just his presence there turns out to be criminal, then he would be liable for what follows. That people were trying to hit and kick him are honestly pretty secondary issues.  His defense cant be ""Self defense."" It has to be ""my presence there was reasonable, justified and not a threat to others"" which, given the facts, is a near absurd conclusion.

>Otherwise, complicated self-defense cases like this go to court and get ruled out there.

This reminds me of how the McClusky case was handled on this sub, the couple pointing weapons at BLM protesters. Everyone here screamed about trespassing, property rights and #gatelivesmatter but that was all a red herring. If you watch the couple in interviews, they keep saying how they felt their lives were in danger. They say that not as a hype tactic but because thats a required element of their defense. Despite what people here think, you cant just waive weapons at people for walking through your driveway. You have feel as though you (or others with you) are in actual danger. 

>You could have just said you're not a lawyer.

In the end, you dont need to be a lawyer to know that 4 out of 5 times the law does not care ""who started it."" Thats a crap way to write laws and a great way to let the one-who-lives get away. If you want to own a firearm you need to know how the law works and when it allows you to use it. You cant trope across state lines and start ordering people around."
Libertarian,"You cant take an illegal weapon on to random parcels of property and start defending it with lethal force. If you do that, your status is that of a criminal. Therefore, as a criminal, it *absurdly unlikely unless otherwise specifically legislated* that you can legally defend yourself with lethal force. 

I will not waste my time getting into the weeds with people who think the only possible charge that exists is first degree murder. Officials have already indicated that he will be charged with at *least* [reckless homicide.](https://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2010/940/940.02.html) Nothing you have posted yet is a good defense to that level of expectation."
Libertarian,"Legally speaking, its 100% black and white. He is violating the law just by taking a gun there in that situation. Therefore he is assuming a cascading level of responsibility for the actions that follow. You cant compartmentalize each murder when they are in a chain of the same crime.

Basically, you think youre arguing innocence or guilt but what youre arguing for is voluntary manslaughter."
Libertarian,Not how self defense works.
Libertarian,"I dont think, in this case, he is excusing his actions by saying ""out of fear."" It means he is surrounded and over his head, thinking his firearm would bring order. This Kyle had no fucking clue and people still chased and attacked him, gun be damned. Im reminded of the guy in Dallas who tried to chase people off with a sword and got his ass handed to him. People have no clue how the dynamic of a mob works. You cant just wave a gun and think ""ooo boy thatll calm them down."""
BigBrother,RaTcOLe!!!
BigBrother,"This clip today would be followed by a bad TMZ story, an online petition to have her removed as a threat, and 30 diary room warnings."
BigBrother,"Janelle Queen
David bad.

Ok everyone thats all there is to discuss, apparently. Lets go home."
BigBrother,No need Im already subbed here.
BigBrother,Give it two weeks this community will forget her
BigBrother,"Literally everyone banged pots and pans to get David a return chance saying it was unfair lol now people are like ""WOW HOW DID HE GET A SPOT IN THE HOUSE?!"" 

All of you. He is here because of all of you."
politics,Added. Sorry about format error.
BigBrother,"Yea, this week. Youre going to have to wait. You dont see the timebomb of having overlapping alliances?"
BigBrother,Its week 3. The whole cast has knives ready behind their backs. Let the walls close in a bit. This season is setup to get good at jury.
BigBrother,"Not always, obviously. But look at the example I gave. Thats a prime example of petty, grandiose drama that would have been marked as epic 15 years ago but now labeled as problematic bullying. 

As much as I enjoy this community, anything like nuance is dead here. A cast member says something bad, they should be called out. Instead every ally of that cast member and every conversation they have is bathed in speculation of bigotry and racism."
BigBrother,"Old time fans: ""I want seasons with argumentative, problematic people constantly at each other's throats.""

CBS: **BB21**

Fans: No not like that. 

Pick one. You cant have a shitshow season cast then hurl people under the bus for being mean to others. Like was Gra8ful jumping around in the HoH room good TV/feed, or is a systematic casting issue that needs to be fixed? Do you want the house full of socially adept gameplayers or assholes yelling at each other?"
Libertarian,Your metaphor doesnt work. Imagine you go into a Starbucks and order a coffee wearing t-shirts that express hate for black people and you call someone the n-word while waiting in line. You get kicked out. Thats what its like.
SquaredCircle,Ok but fyi you can just clip nudes that are older. Thats happened. A bunch.
politics,Im going to let it pass just to let you know it does get seen.
politics,Format fixed. Sorry about that.
politics,"I hope they remember that you could plug in Sonic 2 into the original Sonic and Knuckles and play Sonic 2 as Knuckles, special climb ability and all."
Libertarian,"In 2016 Republicans were trying to find new brands for their ideas that clearly weren't conservative but were trying to usurp the flagship ideology for the right. ""Alt-right"" was the most famous but ""libertarian"", an existing term, was clearly number 2. They found our base useful because they could call themselves libertarian for themselves and just wouldn't give a fuck about other people. (""Non-citizens?! Well rights come from the STATE so why should the government offer our rights to them?"") 

At this point the plot is completely gone. Many of those people have fallen off the libertarian wagon but tens of thousands still remain, deluded until this very day."
neoliberal,Fox was always this big quasai-asshole personality.
politics,Every campaign has a website with specific policy positions.
BigBrother,Nicole has always had bad reads and bad game. She was a good person in a house of assholes. In this game-heavy house she is floundering
politics,The version of Ted Cruz with some backbone would like a word with you.
neoliberal,....ew
Libertarian,"Youre all rhetoric, no substance. Dont mistake getting exhausted with you as some sort of victory. I imagine that happens a lot."
politics,Reminds me of the Samwise Gangee speech
politics,The party functions start at noon but the speakers and tv broadcasts start at 9. (EST)
Libertarian,You have no clue what moderating involves.
BigBrother,Bay has decent play
politics,What youve said ignores the difference of power between a Republican presidency vs a Democratic one.
Libertarian,Holy hyperbole Batman.
Libertarian,"They do that because the admins don't communicate all the words that need to be removed. Theyre literally playing a guessing game. 

Just go somewhere else if you just want to say slurs all day."
Libertarian,"Personal property that is protected, litigated, parceled, zoned and supplied. 
 
Kind of seems like youre just leasing property from the government."
Libertarian,Dont forget changes to hiring practices. Many precincts dont require any information about infractions in previous employment.
Libertarian,">one of the few legitimate actions of government is to protect property

Is property even really private at that point?"
Libertarian,Camden New Jersey shows the opposite. You just made your fact up.
Libertarian,"Wrong. Heres what happens. 

They explain the rules. People want a unmoderated paradise to say the N-word. They explain why reddit doesnt allow it. Angry screeching. Locked thread. 

You just dont want to listen. Beyond that, all modlogs are made public. Source them."
Libertarian,"What youre on about is an ideological issue, not a moderation one."
SquaredCircle,Maryland also has a similar age range caveat
BigBrother,I dont think its the edit
Libertarian,"""Dont tread on *me.* threading on other people is ok."""
Libertarian,lmao
Libertarian,"As much as the left memes how libertarians are just Republicans, a lot has shifted from 2016. Those types have largely left and embraced Trump. Anti-authority is the norm here."
Libertarian,Non sequitur. Try again.
Libertarian,"Neat. Just saying ""no its the current year. Full stop"" works?"
Libertarian,We should shut down all discussion about how resisting arrest allows for lethal tactics.
