These reports could be marked as non-useful to curb bad reports instead of skewing their actionability rate. 

It would also be great if we could get some additional sorting and filtering options in the mod queue/other mod views. Some that come to mind are: 

- Sort by number of user reports
- Hide AutoModerator/bot reports (i.e. only show user reports)
- Sort by actionability rate of the reporter

redditdev,"Try deleting the post again from the desktop site and running the test again. Right now it’s looking like it was only removed and not deleted, but it’s possible that there is an error with the /del endpoint (or there was an error when you ran the test last). "
redditdev,"Moderators can remove a post, which basically hides it from different reddit listings. Users can delete their own posts, which will hide them from reddit listings, and change the author name to ""[deleted]"".

redditdev,"PRAW will handle all pagination for you. If you request 10,000 items for example, it will keep getting posts from r/all until all posts have been retrieved. I just tried doing `hot(limit=10000)`, and it retrieved 8115 items from reddit. "
redditdev,"You can use `hot(limit=1000)` \(or any number between 1 and 1000\). You can request up to 1000 items from a listing on reddit, but reddit won't always return 1000 items."
redditdev,"Streams in PRAW are meant for new posts or comments that were recently submitted to a subreddit, not for finding the top items in a subreddit. To iterate over the hot items in r/all, you would use: `for submission in reddit.subreddit('all').hot()`."
redesign,Header widgets would be really cool 
redesign,"Yes, this. Functionally they're very similar but I think a lot of subreddits have clearly defined uses for announcement banners versus sticky posts. "
redesign,">Reddit Live entry point \(in progress\): Reddit Live is an excellent product and when there is breaking news we often feature a live thread on the top of the home feed. This week, we are adding in the functionality so that live threads can be featured.

It would also be cool if mods could also feature specific threads \(live or otherwise\) as a banner on the homepage of their subreddits. A lot of subreddits do this with CSS hacks right now, which makes me think it would be a well\-used feature on the redesign. I know mods can edit the menu bar with links and dropdown menus, but that doesn't grab attention in the same way that a banner can.

On the topic of live threads, it would be cool if there was a way to embed them in a widget. I think a good number of subreddits could find a lot of value in putting them in the sidebar. Many subreddits feature news or updates in old.reddit sidebars as it is, but this would be an easy way to continually update a subreddit without having to edit a plaintext or CSS widget."
redditdev,I don't think PRAW supports anything related to reddit chat right now since there are no official API endpoints for chat on reddit currently.
ModSupport,"Yes, but subreddits like yours generally have to be marked as NSFW. If they're not, the admins will likely tell you to turn on that setting, or turn it back on for you. "
ModSupport,"It looks like that subreddit has image/video uploading disabled. It's possible that some users get around this by using private subreddits that don't have the 18\+ setting checked. They use their private subs to host images/videos, and then they post those links in other subreddits. "
ModSupport,"Unless it's changed recently, reddit does not host images for NSFW subreddits. "

redditdev,"Sure, I found it a while back using the Web Inspector on Safari. I used the ""Timelines"" tab, and clicked the record button to see all of the requests the page made."
redditdev,I don't think this is a documented endpoint. It's used to populate the list of moderated subreddits on the new profile pages. The biggest downside to this is that they could remove or rename it at anytime.
redditdev,"I don't think that PRAW officially has a way of getting this information. You can do something like this, though:

    import praw
    
    reddit = praw.reddit(...)

    response = reddit.get(path)
    
    for sub in response[""data""]:

In your specific use case, it would look similar to this:

    user = ""keynan""
    
    def get_subs():
        sub_list=[]
        path = ""/user/{user}/moderated_subreddits"".format(user=user)

redditdev,"I don't know about the first two properties, but ""header mouseover text"" is the value for `header_title`.  "
ModSupport,You could use your subreddit's wiki to hold data like this. A lot of subreddits put longer documents in their wikis. 
redditdev,"Praw (and reddit in general) does not have a built in way to search comments. You can check out [pushshift's API](https://github.com/pushshift/api), though. It's a third party tool that lets you search comments (and a whole lot more). "
redditdev,"It's found at https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/about.json. If you parse the json, the URL is found at `json[""data""][""header_img""]`. 

Using praw, you can get it with `reddit.subreddit('SUBREDDIT').header_img`"
redditdev,"Try changing `f.write(item.author + ""\n"")` to `f.write(str(item.author) + ""\n"")`. You have to add the `str()` outside of `item.author` so that python knows to convert a Redditor object into a string."
redditdev,That bot detector sounds like a really useful feature. How accurate is it right now?
NoStupidQuestions,"Although you are correct that moderators can hide the score, that setting [only applies to comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/) and not to posts.

changelog,"I understand that, but I don't think it's the best user experience if regular users (who might not understand or care about escape characters) have to escape a question mark to search something if they're using reddit's frontend. "
changelog,"I made that search URL using the search bar in the sidebar of a subreddit. I understand escaping it if this was an API call, but I think if searching with a question mark from the front end it should be auto escaped. 

>Hmm yeah that looks like a bug. I'll take a look

Thanks, I appreciate it. "
changelog,"Something I've noticed with the new search is that certain characters don't work. Queries with question marks ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=What%27s+behind+rich+people+pretending+to+be+self-made%3F&restrict_sr=on)) don't seem to work. Is this an intentional design choice?

I've also noticed that the `site` parameter doesn't seem to work as expected anymore. For example [this search for `site:yahoo.com`](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=site%3Ayahoo.com&sort=new&restrict_sr=&t=all) also returns results for other sites that contain `yahoo.com` in the url. 

I don't think these queries are anything fancy or special, I just want them to work properly :("

redesign,"Fwiw, the intent behind this suggestion isn't spam prevention - as you said there are more effective ways to handle that. Some subreddits have specific rules that only allow x posts per day/minute/etc., and the post requirements would help subreddits enforce this rule. "

redesign,"> That's a cool way to use automod. So y'all have a whitelist of domains, but also a list where automod will offer guidance on blacklist domains? Having submit validations link out to the specific rule could be a light-weight way to help out to do this. I appreciate your thoughts on that.

Basically we have a specific rejection notice for some domains, and a general rejection notice for everything else. Something like facebook might receive a notice saying that social media links aren't allowed in r/politics, while websiteIjustStarted2minutesAgo.com would receive the general notice since it's a rarely submitted/unknown domain.

The same behavior that we have now could be replicated by letting moderators set custom error messages for domains/groups of domains if they're not allowed in a subreddit. 

>Agree that this would be nice, and also agree on the priority. Sharing lists between subreddits would be much simpler.

Our reasoning behind this is that we want to be able to import/export these domains to our wiki pages and external tools for analysis. Although subreddit to subreddit transfers would be nice, it wouldn't work for all of the things we use it for. "

redesign,"I like it! One thing that we've noticed so far is that the settings page loads slowly for subreddits with large amounts of whitelisted/blacklisted domains. It would also be nice if the domains could be collapsed when we're not actively editing them since it makes the page very long.
