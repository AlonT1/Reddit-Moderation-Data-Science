Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it breaks the following rule(s) of r/LivestreamFail:

**Rule 3.3 - Quality: Clickbait**

>Do not use titles or flairs to exaggerate the content of your post to generate views. Additionally, submissions whose titles contain excessive caps, emoji, exclamation marks, etc. will be removed.
>
>Jokes do not fall under this rule, so “streamer pulls out their cock on stream” would be an acceptable title if the streamer shows their pet chicken, for example.

LivestreamFail,"Hi, /u/International_Fetus,

Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it breaks the following rule(s) of r/LivestreamFail:

**Rule 2 - Politics**

>Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. The common census among you and other moderators is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn't inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts. 
>
>Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.

Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it breaks the following rule(s) of r/LivestreamFail:

**Rule 2 - Politics**

>Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. The common census among you and other moderators is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn't inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts. 
>
>Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.

LivestreamFail,"Hi, /u/scarycloud,

Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it breaks the following rule(s) of r/LivestreamFail:

**Rule 2 - Politics**

>Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. The common census among you and other moderators is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn't inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts. 
>
>Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.

Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it breaks the following rule(s) of r/LivestreamFail:

**Rule 2 - Politics**

>Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. The common census among you and other moderators is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn't inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts. 
>
>Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.

LivestreamFail,"Hi, /u/nickdanewt,

Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it breaks the following rule(s) of r/LivestreamFail:

**Rule 2 - Politics**

>Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any content related to politics will be removed. The common census among you and other moderators is that, for the sake of not having to draw blurry lines that leave space for individual bias and animosity between mods, it would be best to also be more strict with content that isn't inherently political, but carries a political intent or message nonetheless. This affects, for example, streams with a campaigning background regardless of the content shown, and podcasts. 
>
>Exceptions are made when the content directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.

**Rule 2 - Political submissions**

>Politics are out of scope for LSF, so any submissions related to politics will be removed. Political discussions in comments are allowed, as we can appreciate that comment threads can naturally drift away from the main point of discussion, as well as the fact it can be difficult to discuss certain non-political topics without using political terminology.
>
>Exceptions are made when the subject of the submission directly relates to gaming and/or streaming. Examples of such exceptions are the Blizzard-Hong Kong controversy in 2019, or streamers talking about the effect of Article 13 on the industry.
