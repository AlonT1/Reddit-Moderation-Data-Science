nfl,"Shit, **I** read it as making excuses. Our offense is so bad right now that our ridiculous defense can no longer carry the team. Can we be less than 1-dimensional? Sure, blame that on injuries/Covid/schedule...but that doesn't seem to be the issue...and it's not a new thing. Been going on for a lot longer than 3-weeks. Our defense just kept bailing us out."
WinStupidPrizes,"This sort of move typically doesn't involve anything resembling logic or thought process beyond ""more fire better."" Besides, Larry here might need to pour some of his beer out to watch which way it falls to determine where ""downwind"" is."
nfl,">Week 15 - How could we lose when they don't even have Burrow

Haha the only people thinking that might be on our coaching staff."
nfl,"Defense wins championships sure, but not if it's the practice squad members and a less-than-one-dimensional offense. It's an insult to ""flat."" 5 seems right-ish...but teams figured us out after we inched by Baltimore...cover the middling passes and we have no run game or deep ball. Defense keeps us in it until they run out of gas or every linebacker is dead. Whichever comes first."
nfl,Neither does Eric Ebron or Diontae Johnson.
nfl,Typically we don't allow content such as extremely low-quality images/video or recordings of TV. In this case an exception is being made due to the nature of the ongoing pandemic.
nfl,"I haven't done something like this in a long time...but...

I bet our offense runs the same tired shitshow that it's run 3(more?) weeks in a row now and we put up no more than 17-points on the Bengals. And we still win.

If we don't (say we score 18+ or lose/tie) I will say something nice about the team of your choice on any comment I make on r/NFL for the following week. If the Steelers do win with a score of 17 or less then you say something nice about the Steeler for a week."

nfl,We benefit from a Ravens win. I hate this.
politics,Christmas just a little early.
nfl,Pretty sure this is what our O-line coach is asking right now. Because that's how it looks/feels.
steelers,"Short and sweet; aside from our defense we really suck right now.

Offensive line is the most offensive thing **about** our offense. Ben can't throw deep, our run game is an embarrassment, and our O-line sucks. Translation - we'll throw middling every time. Special teams isn't exactly a bright spot, but it's not the shitshow that our offense is. The only thing our WR's/TE's can reliably catch is probably Covid.

God bless what's left of our crippled defense at this point because they're holding our team together like fucking Flex Tape right now.

I wonder if TJ Watt can play TE? Probably has better hands than Ebron."
nfl,Right?!? It's not like our offense has been exactly on fire lately. They've been mediocre at best. Maybe don't pull shit like this at all...but if you're going to...then make sure you can actually back it up.
steelers,Yeah that's good too. I've just been waiting forever to find an appropriate moment to meme this.
steelers,"God did it hurt to watch our offense play last night. It was like Mason Rudolph or Duck was playing. Ben looked bad, Conner looked bad, nobody had any goddamn hands, and we strung together MAYBE 2 drives the entire game. What the fuck guys."
steelers,Turns out butterfingers are more contagious than Covid.
nfl,It's like...some form of abuse.
nfl,That's painful acceptance right there.
steelers,The best time to correct them was 2018...the second best time was sometime between 2018 and now. The probably 35th or so best time is now. Maybe not fire Randy but man does Fitchner need to adapt or get left behind.
steelers,"Randy, that you?

But in all seriousness our offense has been struggling **mightily** since the Baltimore game and, injuries aside, they have continued to plod along and get carried by the defense...people have figured it out and it‚Äôs now cost us a very important in-conference game, control of the 1-seed, and we just look weak near the end of the year. We either need to change something or we‚Äôll end up a 11-5 wildcard facing a one and done playoff experience."
steelers,Amazing he didn‚Äôt miss the high-five/handshake...or drop his jacket in the process.
nfl,LOL bold if you to assume we won‚Äôt run the exact same offense.

nfl,This has been our entire year.
nfl,"Oh, so we‚Äôre just gonna lose? Alright then. Sounds good."
nfl,"We‚Äôre gonna get shit on all week if we lose this game.

Bills lose this game and it‚Äôll be a tight matchup against the top team in the AFC. This‚Äôll be a tough week if we can figure out how to score points and all."

nfl,Why was Watton the sideline forever?!?

Yes!"

nfl,LOL was that Heyward nearly unblocked?
nfl,Right? Can he not throw it anymore?!? I don‚Äôt get it...what‚Äôs happened?
nfl,That was a throw-away for sure.
nfl,We pick up a deep pass in this game it‚Äôll be an actual Christmas Miracle.

nfl,"If you have a running game that can move the ball 3-4 yards on the regular, maybe not every single play, but enough to keep the run on the radar of the defense, you can pressure both. Without any valid run game they knew we were passing. All the time. They could essentially abandon their run defense except at the goal line where it's far more obvious what we're looking to do.

Obviously passing the ball on 1^st - 4^th down worked very well for us. If running earlier in the second half continued to not work then we'd likely have had the same outcome."

running,"Living in Florida we have the same problem but in summer. The ""low"" temperature for the day in ~June through September might be 85¬∞ with literally 100% humidity. At 5am. I'm not kidding. Sure sometimes it drops into the 70's. But the humidity remains. Yes, you will not freeze to death. But you'll lose about 5-pounds of water in the first hour or so of running. 

Hell's Front Porch is my favorite way to describe it. I'd still rather run in that than be stuck inside on the treadmill...I've cranked my air down to 65¬∞ (which murders my electric bill) and I still prefer to run outside while basically breathing soup than to be stuck on the damn treadmill. I once ran in the beginnings of an actual hurricane because I hate running inside. I had to cut it short because the rain was starting to hurt my face. I just hate treadmill running. A lot.

Again, I did a little looking this morning and, as some people have pointed out, this is a narrative-driven award not ""who came back best"" sort of award, and someone else put it nicely ""there is no planet where Ben makes a better narrative than Alex Smith."" And they're right."
steelers,"Was well-aware of the severity of things; just didn't realize how narrative-driven this award is. Alex Smith's return certainly makes a better story, even if Ben's return may be more impactful towards his career and the franchise history."

TheSilphRoad,"I usually wait until the next portion of the season but I'm getting a little stuck just before rank 12 today.

100% BB Medicham (Power up punch/Ice Punch) lead

Mew (Flame Charge/Wild Charge) swap

Forretress (Power Whip/Thunder)

There are two Pokemon I can't hang with; Alolan Marowak and Sableye. Either of these Pokemon can sink this team if they hit at the wrong spot or when I don't have loaded energy. It struggles with the standard Grasshole lineup but only if I'm stupid. Does GREAT against G-Stunfisk leads and actually moderately well against Azumaril leads.

Mew with Flame Charge/Wild charge is a little broken and can beat Alolawak in the 2-shield. If I see it in the lead I swap to Mew and HOPE that they stay in. If they do I win. If they don't it's already over. Staying in with Medicham usually indicates that I have 1 good counter to it and 1 horrible counter to it so they know that and swap if I sac Medicham. I ran into an AlolaWak lead once, swapped Mew, and they swapped in Sableye. I didn't even bother staying around for that; it was already over.

Grasshole is scary but interesting. Bastiodon is led typically so they'll swap out instantly. **Usually** Shadow Victreebell comes in. I'll charge to Ice Punch but (usually) throw Power Up Punch to save 1 Counter. It always gets shielded. I **dare** a Grasshole user to call that bluff that early on. I immediately swap in Forretress and shield nothing. Throw 1 Thunder and then I think I can farm or maybe I throw 1 Vine Whip (not much difference either way). Bastiodon comes back out and cleans up. Now I have 2 shields a ~60% health Medicham and my opponent is down to 1 shield but has a nearly full health Bastiodon and a full-health Razor Leafer.

From there I throw Medicham back in and they normally instantly swap out Bastiodon for another Razor-Leafer. I usually charge to Ice Punch and throw it before ducking out. This time, though, I'm out for damage and I don't bluff. *Typically they shield this and at that point it's game over. I can 1-shot basically any Razor-Leafer with Flame Charge or it gets it close enough that the initial farm + boosted Shadow Claw(s) at the end will do the job. Then I bring in Medicham, resist the Smack Down from Bastiodon and fire off PuP as needed once Bastiodon beats Mew.

*Now...where it can get hairy is if they have the survivability to live through Ice Punch and don't shield as mentioned above. Now they have 1 shield left and I have to work a bit. Usually I run into a second shadow Razor-Leafer, but if it's a regular one and it can take a beating, then I'm in trouble. If they run the super-old-school lineup of Bastiodon, S-Vic, DDeoxys, then I'm in the clear usually because they'll switch from Bastiodon to S-Vic, Ferrothorn will own that, Bastiodon or DD farms Feerrothorn, and I get my pick of Mew on DD, or Medicham on Bastiodon.

___________

LOL! This is a much longer answer to the short question you asked but I love talking strategy. Helps me see if there are any flaws in the way I usually play.

MapPorn,">Many people in the Pittsburgh area say yinz.

And suddenly I'm home."
TheSilphRoad,"I actually stopped running G-Stunfisk (for a variety of reasons) but I ran it for a very long time so I'm **very** familiar with the charging time(s) of its moves, what it can tank and what it can't. My current team all fares well against it with or without shields, none outright lose to it. But that's how you have to do it; if you have more than 1 Pokemon losing to Azumaril or G-Pancake you're going to have a rough go."
TheSilphRoad,"I've said it before to a few people now, I was using this example to highlight how outlandishly difficult it's going to be to power Legendaries up under the current system."
TheSilphRoad,"Yeah, I've already said it to a few other people, but I was using a relatively common (and useful) Pokemon such as the Eeveelutions to demonstrate how difficult it would be to power a legendary to 50."
TheSilphRoad,"Yeah, Eevee is a realistic expectation, but I was more using it as an example to demonstrate how difficult it'd be for a legendary such as Mewtwo."
TheSilphRoad,"You're 100% correct, but I was using Eevee as a setup for legendaries. It'll be the 7th of Never before we can power up more than 1 legendary if our main source of candy income for them is by converting rare candies to Mewtwo (for example) candies, and then converting those into XL candies. That's assuming Mewtwo isn't currently in raids...which won't actually help as much as it sounds; someone pointed out that it takes ~1200 raids to get a level 50 legendary. **One** level 50 legendary."
TheSilphRoad,Bold of you to assume 980-years will be enough.
TheSilphRoad,"Looks like it's #11 on the list with wins against Gtina (with legs), Cresselia, Swampert, A-Muk, and Charizard. Not a bad spread. The big boy is Galarian Stunfisk which tops out at 2474 at level 51 perfect IV. It loses to Gtina in the 1-shield but wins in the 0-shield which, to me, is more important especially if you lead it. I picked Umbreon as an example at something I had a remote chance of maybe possibly powering up soon-ish. G-Stunfisk might as well be a legendary...also I don't have a hundo."
nfl,Sure but they forgot how to catch. We had 11 drops that game. If we make half(?) of those we win by 3-scores probably.
TheSilphRoad,"I have a level 25, 100% Eevee that I plan on evolving into Umbreon during next year‚Äôs supposed 2018 community day or just forgoing that and using an ETM to get Last Resort. A 100% level 51 Umbreon is  2445 cp and looks to be an absolute monster in that league.

However...it will take 475k dust, 298 regular candy, and 296 XL candy to max. I have 9 XL Eevee candies at present and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll gather a few more along the way, but that means I need 28,998 Eevee candies to max it out. And then an additional 75 to teach it a second move. Now I have a lot of Eevee candies, 4,880 to be exact, but there‚Äôs an obscene discrepancy here purely in terms of using regular candy to convert to XL candy. Even taking one of the most common Pok√©mon, I currently have enough to make 140 XL candies. Still not enough to get from 40-50. I‚Äôm a pretty regular player, but I‚Äôm sure there are people with more resources stored than I in this aspect.

However, what if we look at legendaries? Now we‚Äôre in crazy-land. Can‚Äôt put them in gyms. Can only trade one per day. Not available in the wild. When‚Äôs the next Mewtwo raid? Arceus only know. It took a while, I feel an appropriately long time, to max and dual-move a legendary using only/mostly rare candies. This is an absurd amount of time/resources to commit to **a single Pok√©mon.** I don‚Äôt see how this is sustainable or attainable even paying a ton to do extra raids."

What's weird is that they could easily miss the playoffs with a 10-6 or even 11-5 record. That includes adding a 7th seed to the playoffs. The Titans are currently in a very similar boat."
running,Late to the party but good for you dude. The bad runs make the good ones so much better. Keep it up!
running,">I'm so jealous. Is 60s pretty much the coldest it gets there?

It gets colder, but not often. It was 50's the last 2 days actually, but only for a few hours from ~4-7 am. It occasionally drops into the 30's here, but I'm talking 2-4 times per year. If we're lucky. Here's the caveat - it's 39¬∞ **with near 100% humidity.** So the cold cuts through whatever you're wearing like a knife. I worked with a lady from New York City and the first time it dipped below 40¬∞ in 2019 she had 5 coats on and was asking WTF is wrong with my state. It was in the 80's a few days ago then **BAM** it's 39¬∞ and it feels like 20's. I was biking one day when it was in the 40's and my hands got so cold (through gloves) that I had to stop because with the ""wind chill"" of me moving 18-20 mph the ""feels like"" temperature was ~26 or something.

Now...let's unpack the rest of that quote from above. A solid 80-90% of the year it is 75¬∞ at 5 am with 100% humidity and that's the low. It's like Hell's front porch...if Hell is sticky and wet. They say that heat-training is similar to training at altitude and I agree. I ran the Chicago marathon in 2015 and at the finish it was 72¬∞ and people were passing out from the heat and receiving medical attention. I was cold. Cold enough that my nipples chaffed and I ruined a shirt with vasoline. I have had **numerous** daytime runs where the ""feels like"" was in the triple digits and at least a handful where it exceeded 110¬∞ F. Imagine when you breathe while running and you only get credit for ehhhh 70% of the air that enters your lungs. But that's normal and maybe 10-20% of the year it **doesn't** feel like that.

It's. Awful. Florida is not for everyone and if I didn't have a ton of family here my wife and I have LOOOOOOOOONG since agreed that we'd be out of Dodge in a hot minute with the kids. Colorado. Something with mountains...and less Hellish temperatures."
running,"**Complaint:** I am currently a little fat.

**Uncomplaint:** I'm also faster than I've been in a while.

**Uncomplaint:** Florida has finally decided that 75¬∞ F with 100% humidity isn't OK for 5am anymore - it's been in the 60's the last few days here...finally..."

Seems like only a small section is cantilevered out over thin air."
triathlon,"Several factors (fueling absolutely being one of them) I believe came into play - first off, my marathon time is honestly a bit higher than what I think I'm capable of. I went out to try and BQ. My first half was around 1:30. I realized around mile 11 that I was going to be slightly over 1:30 at the half unless I really picked my pace up and that meant the marathon under 3 was absolutely not happening. So I bonked a little near the end of that one. I think if I'd gone out at a ~7:15 min/mile pace I would've landed it quite nicely and come in around 3:10. But that's neither hear nor there and me nitpicking just one sport.

With regards to the IM I didn't really have a true ""expectation"" aside from ""eh, I think I can run 8.5-9-minute miles and be OK."" The temperature really messed with me. I live in Florida SOUTH of where IMFL takes place. Near Tampa. So it's hot here. A lot. All the time. And damn humid. When I left to drive up to Panama City it was 75¬∞ at 5am. I arrived in Panama City as a cold front was moving south and it was 45¬∞ and it didn't get much warmer. Now I have run/biked/swam in the cold, but that was chillier than I was used to. The water temp dropped to wet-suit legal overnight from the low 80's.

At swim start it was 39¬∞ outside. The water temp was 68¬∞ and I decided that I was going to change out of my wet tri suit after the swim into dry bike clothes. I clocked the swim in ~88-minutes which was about what I expected, and when I got out it was still low 40's. On the bike I'm used to sweating a fair amount because when you ride and the LOW temperature during most of your training rides is 75-85¬∞ with 100% humidity (I'm seriously not kidding about these numbers; Florida sucks) you sweat a lot.

I did not sweat on the ride until several hours in. Meanwhile I'd been sucking down Gatorade and water like I had a hole in me somewhere. It didn't mess with my digestion or anything (no emergency bathroom stops), but I didn't take in much solid food. Because that's what I normally did; a ton of Gatorade/water and a few chews easily got me through my 80-100 mile training rides and had me feeling fresh (as fresh as one can be really) at the end.

So off the bike and onto the run I felt ""OK,"" but could tell around mile 4 that I wasn't going to be able to hold my current pace. I soldiered on through the first 8-miles without any walking but at mile 9 I realized I had to start walking the water stops or I was going to have issues later on. I've been running since 2011 and have done 10 (more?) marathon distances or greater races before the Ironman...so I have a good gauge of when I'm crashing and how to get it under control. 

Step 1 - walk the water stops. 

Step 2 - walk 0.1-mile, run 0.9-mile

Step 3 - increase the walk from step 2 as needed

Fortunately I didn't make step 3, but I got close. By the time I slowed I could tell my body was hungry but anytime I ate something it made me want to throw up. The fix? Cookies. Yes. Chocolate chip cookies. I treated it like an ultramarathon; eat whatever doesn't make you barf. I'd wash the cookies down with water (weird but it worked) so they were mushy and I didn't choke on them.

**TL;DR:** The really short story is yes, fueling played a role in my demise, but the cool weather (surprisingly) caused my regular fueling to be insufficient."
triathlon,"I'm lucky in this aspect. I'm a runner first and foremost. I'm a decent cyclist. I swim so that I don't drown. Getting the crappy part out of the way first is like ripping the bandaid off. Sure I hobble out of the water coughing and sputtering, but then that shit's over with and I can hop on the bike. Which is second-worst for me. Once I'm done with that particular nightmare I get to reward myself with a run. Finally - my sport.

_____________

It depends what you're training for, but the following may help:

1. Run slower in your training.

2. Run more miles. (also helps if you're running slower)

3. Increase the run portion of your brick workouts.

4. Find a training plan for the specific distance you're training. Structured training helps loads even if it feels awful.

______

For reference, I'm a 3:18 marathoner, but my marathon at IMFL in 2019 was 4:55:56. You'll run slower at any tri you do regardless. I did an Olympic back in August 2019 that had a 10k at ~7:23 min/mile pace. My usual ""easy"" pace varies from 8:30-10:00 min/mile depending on how horribly hot Florida decides to be and if the humidity is off the charts (frequently). Right now since it's finally dropped below 70¬∞ in the mornings I'm sitting at low 9's, high 8's. When it's 50's with low humidity I see the 8:30-range coming back.

Hope that helps."
nfl,THE JAGUARS ARE SO BAD THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO LOSE TO THEM.
starterpacks,"Meanwhile here in Florida it's 75¬∞ at 5am frequently still. We're in a cold snap right now that's 2-days old...as of 9:30am (right now) it's a chilly 64¬∞ F. The high today is 82¬∞ F and I'd kill for the air to breathe like something other than thick soup.

I'm a runner and nothing is worse than feeling physically cool, but there's 100% humidity outside because fuck you that's why so when you breathe a full breath in you get maybe 65% ""credit"" for it and it gets oh-so-much-worse when the temperature rises above 70¬∞ F."

nfl,"The good thing for him was that when he got hit he wasn't **planted** on the leg; he was about to be planted on it, but not there yet. It sure looked nasty, but Roethlisberger has taken a few awkward hits like that because he likes to extend the play and this sort of thing had me worried bad in 2015 but Ben came back from it.

https://www.businessinsider.com/ben-roethlisberger-knee-injury-2015-9

Ben was almost fully planted on the foot and got really lucky. He ended up missing only 4-games. I know Ben doesn't rely on his legs like a left tackle would, but 6-8 weeks seems realistic if the diagnosis is correct."

I even went with some off-meta shit and I'm leading into a wall, safe-switching into a second wall and, **surprise!** my final Pokemon has no play against any of my opponents team.

Also, my connection has been garbage today. I lost 3 matches (perhaps 4, but the last one was iffy to start) purely because everyone stopped attacking...and then suddenly my Pokemon died and my opponent had half a million energy.

Also, the only thing that I've found that gets beat by Bronzor and is still very useful is Cottonee. I ran Stunky/double-charmer for about 3-days(?) and the first day I ran it felt like back when Charizard/double-charmer was new in Ultra League. Lead Stunky, opponent throws out anything other than Bronzor? Switch to Minccino. Out comes Bronzor. Throw 1-2 Aqua Tail before fainting. Stunky comes out and farms Bronzor. Loses to whatever comes next. Cottonee comes out and my opponent quits during the farm-down. They 100% had Deino in the back."

nfl,"I'd love to see us go 16-0, but realistically speaking that won't happen. We still have to play the Ravens (again), the Bills, and the Colts, not to mention some bad teams that we like to play down to. If we keep playing as we are we'll probably lose 2 of the 3 (Ravens Bills Colts), and maybe 1 against the Bengals/Bengals/Jaguars/Washington/Browns. 13-3 is a very realistic expectation at this point. Especially if we are locked into whatever playoff seed we end up with at the end of the year and rest the starters against the Browns.

**THAT SAID**...November/December really are our big months...we've had plenty of 6-2 runs down the last 8 games that put us into the playoffs or at least into contention. If you can be inconsistent and keep winning the games you normally lose...I guess you do you."

The 'Nam vets are now exclusively in their 60's (most 70's, and many 80's) unless they lied about their age to enlist. The war ran almost 20-years (1955-1975), and that easily puts some of the earlier veterans into their 80's. Some Vietnam vets also fought in WWII and would be in their 90's at this point."

nfl,"I'm gonna show my old Ravens hate here...it's because Joe ""Elite Dragon"" Flacco wanted a big DPI call. He'd do it to us once a game min and we'd bite every time. Most throws weren't catchable but our secondary was too stupid not to take the bait. Drove me nuts."

steelers,Washington sends its regards.
nfl,"Yup. They've been the annoying loss that kept us out of the playoffs more than a few times when our team really got hot down the stretch. In 2006 when I was in college I remember a dude that had a few engineering classes with me that was a Raiders fan. They were 2-14 that year. One of their wins was against us. If memory serves that win would've put us in the 6th seed...or at least in the running. Chiefs took the 6 seed, but the Broncos were also 9-7. Steelers beat the Chiefs and lost to the Broncos. Not sure how the 3-way tiebreaker would've played out...but my buddy had this smug feeling of satisfaction because his Raiders kept my Steelers from the playoffs after we went 6-2 down the last 8 games."

nfl,"Fair point, but having watched Ben play through the years, and seeing how he's been playing so far this year, I feel like the skill gap between him and Mahomes isn't enough to sway the game. I hope I'm right because I'm 99% sure we WILL play them in the playoffs if the season continues down the path it's currently on."
nfl,"The only reason we beat Baltimore is because Ben started playing sandlot football. Is Mahomes the better QB? Statistically speaking, absolutely, but you can't easily put a metric on Ben's ability to make crap happen when there just isn't anything there. Now, has that gotten him into trouble in the past? For sure. He's refined that a lot and knows that throwing the ball away occasionally is acceptable. The difference between these 2 teams is almost non-existent...and I super-hope we don't meet them in the playoffs...but there's no other QB I'd rather see at the helm than Captain Fat-Fuck right now."

EngineeringStudents,With something like aerospace? I could see that happening. I am straight up not smart enough for that. Or at the very least it makes me too nervous. Design dirt within 1/10th of a foot and pavement to 1/100th? Sure. Sign and seal something designed to 1/1000th of an inch? Hard pass.
EngineeringStudents,"No longer a student but I started college in 2005. I was in the school of architecture but didn't know if I wanted to be an engineer or architect. So I took the engineering prereqs as well. After a year-ish in architecture, I was presenting a project that I'd worked ~40+ hours on and one of the ""jury"" looked at my project (frowned) and asked me ""how does this area here make you feel?""

What.

I got a C on that project. The following week I went to my advisor and swapped to engineering because no. I had to complete the course so I just stuck with it and phoned it in. I spent like 5-hours watching football and finishing my final project for the course...and I wrecked the curve. It was total half-assery on my part. A complete joke...and they ate it up. That cemented the decision for me.

Note - during this entire time I never failed courses...but I was dropping them left and right or getting the occasional ""D."" I dropped calc 1 twice and realized that calc 1 for math majors was my only option to not pay out of state tuition. Yes. I took calc 1 three times. I passed with flying colors the third time. Geotech 1? I technically passed Geotech 2 before that. Dynamics? That's supposed to be a ~2nd-year course for civil engineers. It was the last course I took to graduate college. It was also my 3rd attempt as I'd dropped it once and gotten a ""D"" in it once.

After a year or so of true engineering school, and 2-ish years into college I found myself working 39.5-hours at a hardware store and taking 12-ish credit hours a semester...and then dropping 3-6 of them. My advisor (who also taught statics/dynamics) asked me to meet him one day sorta out of the blue. He sat me down and bluntly told me something to the effect of ""if you keep this up, you'll be graduating on the 7th of never.""

I took that to heart and started working 15-20 hours at the hardware store while taking 17-ish credit hours a semester. Now...my study habits still sucked like a black hole. So I got a lot of C's and made a lot of mistakes. But I was committed...or maybe I should've been committed to an institution...but it worked. I finished up all of my courses but had too many ""D's"" in core subjects (see Geotech 1 above). So I re-took Geotech 1, Hydraulics, and Dynamics. Passing all with an A or a B pretty easily. I graduated in fall of 2011...6.5-years after I started. It wasn't fun...but I look back on it sorta longingly now. Although I also still have the recurring ""I haven't been to class in weeks and the final is tomorrow...also there's a project due but I don't even know what the class is about"" nightmare...so that discourages me pretty well from attempting a masters.

I passed the PE in 2017 and have been with my current company since 2013. I do most of the drainage design. Since it's Florida there's basically a pond on every site so it's pretty neat. The PE is an entirely different level of Hell by the way.

Good on you. Aerospace is an entire level that I can't fathom as a civil engineer. If my pond is within ~30% of the size it's designed for it'll almost certainly function for 100+ years without exceeding any measurable constraint. Thinking about you and the structural guys gives me heart burn almost instantly.

Note - DE's not that terrible; reminded me more of calc 2 than calc 3, but I had the same prof. for calc 2 and DE. Also...I took DE twice as well...so there's that. Good luck!"
EngineeringStudents,I didn't learn to Google for shit in college. That came after.
EngineeringStudents,"6.5-years here. Started in 2005, graduated **fall** of 2011. Passed my PE in 2017. Positively no shame in taking more than the standard 4-years. 5-years still has me beat."

TheSilphArena,"Thanks! I really hate what they did to Giratina by nerfing Ominous Wind. It had much more potential to annoy Dialga prior to that. Now the energy cost is severe enough that a failed bait is a sure loss.

I actually tooled around with a Dragonite/Metagross/Groudon team as well...functioned similarly except I wound up switching to Metagross A LOT more. Struggled against the Melmetal/Dialga core a little more so it was hit or miss."
TheSilphArena,You‚Äôll be able to see it once you hit rank 9. They changed it this season; used to be rank 7.
TheSilphArena,Thanks!
TheSilphArena,In theory it shouldn‚Äôt matter.

I got lucky with Dialga (15/14/15, not listed in the above wall of text) - only did a few of those. Did a ton of Groudon raids, but only got a good one through a Lucky Trade. Metagross was a hatch. Giratina was also a Lucky Trade.

Dialga is really the big one that matters and mainly for the mirror. I do mostly free to play so I don't get to do a ton of raids either. I have exactly 4 Zekrom and they're all dumpster-fires. Kuryem? I got super-lucky and landed a hundo. Reshiram? I have 3 and 2 are from trades...
