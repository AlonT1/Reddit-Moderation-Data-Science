politics,"Well, depending on the circumstances of the first scenario, assets can be lost in a bankruptcy to make up some of the loss. If you don't pay your car loan, your car gets repossessed. If you don't pay your mortgage, you lose your house. If you don't pay your student loans.... Nothing happens, because a physical asset can't be seized. They are very different circumstances and types of assets."

SubredditDrama,"The real problem here is that ""normal patriot"" version has never existed. It would be nice if it had, but we've never really had that. And honestly, it doesn't seem like it would be that hard. Well, except the high socio-economic mobility piece. That's difficult to achieve. Doesn't mean we can't try."

TopMindsOfReddit,Nothing says you're a Conservative like getting excited about a state trying to tell other states how they have to do things.

CFB,Thanks Michael
missouri,"The point seemingly being to force a miscarriage, which is no different than having an abortion (whether it works or not). Still, it's in there and thus is the word of the Lord."
Coronavirus,"I'm very sorry to hear about your father. I hope everything is well. I agree this church is a stain. I don't go to church, but so many people I know that do are taking this seriously and masking, social distancing, doing everything they can to protect their congregation. And then James River just shits on all of it."
Coronavirus,This is the type of church where Jesus would walk in and start flipping tables.
Coronavirus,The worst part is they did 4 services a day across 4 different campuses over the weekend and tonight.
Coronavirus,"It's a solid pun, but not mine. I used the article's original title."
Coronavirus,Biggest concern here is how overwhelmed and full our hospitals are in SWMO.
springfieldMO,Imagine not wanting Muslims in your country because you don't support their regressive beliefs while at the same time doing the exact same thing you criticize them for.
springfieldMO,Healthcare workers are dealing with hellish conditions at the moment and it's only going to get worse for them. It must be demoralizing to see how much their community really cares about them by doing shit like this.
missouri,Well Ozark doesn't have any hospitals so they'll be going to Spfd.
missouri,That is not enforced at all in Ozark though.
missouri,Got 'em
missouri,"They get even more pissed when you inform them that not only does the Bible condone abortion, but it also explains how to do it. AND it puts the choice of when to get an abortion firmly in the hands of the husband."
HistoryMemes,"Which is a difficult concept to consider because for most of this, the Bible had not been translated into the vernacular yet. Most people had no idea what the Bible said because they couldn't read, nor could they understand the text because it was in another language. No standard translatiom essentially meant the Bible could say whatever you want. Even the current translations we have are very pick-and-choose about what goes in and what does not."
news,"The most interesting thing about this story will be the GoFundMe situation. This same bar has been defying orders for several weeks now, and making headlines. The man arrested last night was arrested earlier this week. This business has been getting tons of donations. 

Will those dry up now that one of the owners is an attempted cop-killer? It will be interesting to see."

CFB,"Don't feel bad for us, all we ever do is lose. It's nbd. Let me be clear, this is not a pity party. We just do not win games. Even after the two-point conversion, I told my wife we would still lose. We don't win close or big games."
politics,"You're moving the goalposts completely and changing the conversation. No one here is talking about the effectiveness of our democracy, just that we are one, which we certainly are. No amount of ""but people don't really have power"" matters because that isn't the conversation we're having."
nfl,And you know that fits right with the Giants voodoo magic Super Bowl winning cocktail. They'd win that.
politics,"No. You are completely incorrect. We are a democracy, end of story. We elect our representives at the federal, state, and local levels. Those are quite literally Democratic principles. Hell, we even sometimes vote directly on laws at the state and local levels. 

Anyone that says that isn't a democratic process is lying and doesn't know what they're talk about. And anyone that says we're not a democracy because we aren't a direct democracy is being disengenuous at best. 

What you just said is utter nonsense.

Edit: let me actually rephrase this a little. What you just said is totally true in the sense that we as voters have very little power to change things in the whole grand scheme of things. I will definitely give you that. But in the simple ""is the US a Democracy"" the answer is yes. Just.... Not the most efficient."
politics,"No one ever means we're an Athenian-style Direct Democracy when they say we're Democratic or a Democracy, and you know that. Stop being dense. We're a Democratic Constitutional Republic, which makes is a democracy. It's a feature of our government, not the style."
politics,"Yes, they think that because we are."
springfieldMO,"Springfield has a mask mandate. Our hospitals are still overwhelmed because most of the Greater Springfield Area does not. Should our hospitals mandate that they will only accept patients from towns and counties with mandates? It would be highly illegal, but what alternative to they have?"
springfieldMO,It's just one more reason why he doesn't care about small businesses.
springfieldMO,"Did anyone see that paper released today about Germany reducing spread by 50% by mandating a nationwide mask order? It also showed minimal economic impact. Masking should be the goal until vaccines are available because it allows us to not overwhelm hospitals and keep businesses open. 

Wear one!"
SquaredCircle,Mods are a buncha cunts. Make this a mega thread yew cunts!
HistoryMemes,Brexit will take care of that!
news,"Some blame rests with the governors, sure, but it isn't like this is just happening because they woke up one day and said ""hey I think I'll screw over small businesses today"". There is a pandemic going on and some of these areas have been hit pretty hard, so it's understandable. The expectation from most state governments is that the federal government would back them up and help these businesses, like is happening in most countries but.... Nope, not in America."
PoliticalCompassMemes,"Based on your username, I assume you both believe in the same god."
PoliticalCompassMemes,Would it though? What would China even have to gain in that scenario?
Arkansas,"Yes, the tax revenue alone would be a huge boon to the state. 

Also more liberty."
missouri,"If the government can conscript soldiers during a war, then they can mandate masks during a public health crisis."
missouri,"A mask mandate in a vacuum is an authoritarian move that has no place in our government.

A mask mandate in a pandemic where our hospitals are full and having to turn patients away is a different story and completely justified. The government exercising extreme policies during times of crisis is acceptable. Conscription is authoritatian, but sometimes necessary in times of crisis.

It's a mask. It's not a big deal at all, people need to stop being such children about it and do it. It'll pass eventually."
politics,SXENARU
AskReddit,God I hate teachers like that.
AskReddit,No we don't. We know you guys have a workload. Some teachers do seem to think their class is the only one that matters.... They need to get a grip.
AskReddit,Try being a teacher in a high school. They all look like kids now.
AskReddit,"Put the games down and start studying. Seriously. I'm a HS teacher. I play a ton of video games, but I also (generally) have my life together. You can't let them control you. 

Let's extrapolate this out ten years. Do you go to college? Not if you can't finish high school, and even then, if you don't learn self-discipline, you'll drop out quickly and probably be stuck with some debt for it. 

You'll have to get a shitty job which leads to ... Being poor and not being able to afford more video games. I mean, I suppose you could live off welfare, but you'd be in the same boat. That same self-discipline issue will come back and you'll have a tough time holding down a job. 

Not cleaning your house or taking care of yourself? If you live alone (likely), you will live in filth unless you learn to pick up after yourself. If you somehow manage to attract a woman, they won't stick around because women don't want to be with a total slob. Pull your weight (I know I'm assuming you're male here but it applies the other way around too). 

So put the games down and study. You ""might not find happiness"" but understand this: most people don't. They do it because education is the easiest way to a better life. Get your grades on track, go to college, get a good job , meet people. There will be plenty of time for gaming along the way (believe me I know). 

This may have been harsh, but from my experience, teenagers aren't good at thinking ahead about how their choices may affect them in the future. You got this, you can be better, no one can do it but you."
politics,"I really wonder if there is a sxenaru where Cindy or even John (if he had still been alive) endorses Trump over Biden. John and Joe were pretty good friends and worked together in the Senate for a long time, even though they were across the aisle. 

I can't imagine Cindy had any issues endorsing Joe at all, I imagine they still keep in touch."

HistoryMemes,"Just because I know some dumbass is going to ask it: no, Santa never used chattel slave labor in his workshop in the mythology."
AskTrumpSupporters,Interesting. So you believe this is the correct course of action instead of following the Constitution?
PoliticalCompassMemes,"Grilling, but also grilling."
PoliticalCompassMemes,This is fucking based as hell.
politics,"I don't know the numbers on what the government makes in interest - I'm sure it's substantial. Still, I would be surprised if the monthly loss on that came anywhere near the cost of a UBI. 

If you did a UBI - do you get rid of most welfare and unemployment programs? Food stamps? Etc? What goes and what stays? I'm genuinely asking. Medicare and medicaid would stay, of course. Do you limit who gets UBI based on income? I've never seen it as a viable option in the US so ive never done serious research on it."
politics,A UBI is a different discussion altogether. That's an ongoing program rather than a single stimulus boost. It isn't a realistic option at this time.
politics,"It really isn't. For one thing, that isn't the point of forgiving student loans. The point is freeing up a ton of money every month that is currently tied up in paying loans that do little for the economy. 

Helping poor people is a separate but equally (actually, more) important issue that needs to be addressed but is difficult. I can imagine that there is a pretty large chunk of that group that does get loans forgiven, and I bet a lot of them aren't benefitting from higher wages because they didn't finish school. So many of them would benefit, too. 

Do you see what I mean? I'm not trying to ignore them. it's just a separate issue. I hope that makes sense."
politics,"At no point did I ever say anything about poor people without degrees, or this helping those people."
science,"I mean, a lawsuit isn't what I'm talking about. I'm taking about the business employeeing illegal workers. That might not have been the case but if it was, a quick report would get them shut down quickly."
science,"Thanks just begging to have the  whistle blown on it. Surely you reported them, right? I would be shocked if they were legal."
politics,"That isn't trickle down. It's more like trickle up. Trickle down is tax cuts for big business with the intent that theyll raise wages and inject some of that money into the economy by creating more jobs, but that has shown to generally not be what they do."
politics,"No. Giving everyone a stimulus checks I a temporary relief and may add some money to the economy. How many people save that or spend it directly on loans, mortgage, etc. 

Cancelling student debt is a long-term play with almost immediate results. That's 500-1500$ that a huge chunk of people don't have to worry about anymore. That's more money being spent in the economy monthly (rather than just one time) and allows people to buy cars, a mortgage, whatever they'd like because it's a huge chunk of their income that gets freed up."
springfieldMO,"Seems likely, but who knows. My info would be high school related where things are much worse, so it may just be them."
springfieldMO,How dare they.
springfieldMO,"I have heard rumors that SPS won't be back after Thanksgiving. Take that with a grain of salt, obviously."
hoi4,Blue lives truly matter in Estonia
nba,"I mean, if you don't really care about basketball much, would you rather be on a shitty team in Minnesota or NYC?"
missouri,Mayor's don't have anywhere near enough power to do that.
missouri,"You are literally talking about closing hospitals off to people in counties without mask mandates. Do you think those people will just sit around and be fine? Clearly you don't care if people die because that is exactly what would happen to them.

I'm going to guess that you don't work in healthcare because honestly, no administrator of a hospital would ever consider such a plan."
missouri,What you're proposing likely leads to more dead people because you aren't wanting to let rural people in. Hopefully you see the issue here.
missouri,"That might work, but that probably opens the city up for major lawsuits, loss of federal/state funds, and may even bankrupt the hospital. It's a very tricky situation when you bring essential funding into the picture, which is why hospitals can't turn people away in the first place."
missouri,"While I agree with your second paragraph, that isn't how reality works. They open themselves up to the possibility of lost federal and state funds, not to mention major lawsuits if they do that. The law is the law in this case, regardless of whether or not rural areas are making an effort to contain the spread or not."
missouri,"I mean, they aren't going to turn someone away because of where they're from. They'll triage based on severity. Likely they would turn away non-emergency situations over emergency situations. They wouldn't leave someone to die because they're from a rural area. That isn't how hospitals operate, not should they."
missouri,No clue. But the scenario I just replied to would not be legal.
missouri,"Fortunately this isn't legal. Hospitals can't turn you away in three event of an emergency. Now, I imagine that the definition of emergency is up for debate in this instance, but based on typical hospital practice, Covid would fit."

AskReddit,"Agree completely. We have a neighborhood pool so our dues mostly go to maintaining that, and they do a great job generally. I think on Reddit there is a general lack of homeowners, as from my experience a huge percentage of people rent. They sometimes don't understand the general maintenance that goes into owning a home, and how that mitigates really any issue you might have with your HOA."
TopMindsOfReddit,"So basically, Project Veritas."
AskReddit,"They don't want houses in the neighborhood with tall grass because it can ruin the appeal of the neighborhood. Generally this is true for nicer/higher-end subdivisions. I'm sure there are some HOAs that are absolutely awful, but every one I've ever had to deal with has been pretty chill. I've never gotten a letter about my grass (I mow every 1-2 weeks), but we're also fortunate to live in a pretty chill neighborhood."
AskReddit,Because I want to cut the grass while it's still cool outside and not have to worry about it the rest of the day.
missouri,"I was able to get tested twice at Mercy Go Health in Spfd last week with rapid tests, which gave results in 15 minutes. So, it's bad here, but you can still get tested. I had to wait next day to do both of those and booked appointments online.

I don't know if that helps ease your worry. It will get worse in the next few months but we'll see."
missouri,"That's what my students were calling it last spring, I hadn't heard it in awhile."
politics,"He did. The affidavit was withdrawn. Then he went online and said he didn't recant, because saying stuff online doesn't give jail time for perjury."
politics,"He came out online and said that he didn't recant, but he has officially withdrawn his affidavit."
news,"""I'm not clinging to anything"" he says as he continues to post about how Trump will still win. LOL."
news,"None of those states will be overturned, because if any fraud did happen, it was on a small scale and will be easily found. Votes can be verified, and much of the misinformation coming out is just that: misinformation. I'm sorry that you're still clinging to this fantasy that Trump can win and will overturn all of these votes. That just isn't how reality works."
news,"The election battle IS over though, and you're going to need to come to terms with that sooner rather than later. No state is going to send out electors to vote for someone their citizens didn't vote for. That's asinine. There isn't any actual evidence of dead voter fraud in MI, and AZ might flip, but unless it suddenly becomes worth more than 11 electors, it won't matter. 

Accept it, and move on."

news,"He is saying he didn't recant, but he did withdraw the original affidavit. Probably because this story is false and he doesn't want to go to prison for perjury and election tampering."

1. Guy gives statement under oath

2. Sets up GoFundMe account to take donations

politics,"Oh I agree completely, any number we come up with is just an estimate based on the best info we have. After your explaination I think your thought process works fine."
politics,"Ok, I did it similar except I halved the population to get to 50%, required for a majority to gain the electoral votes. It seemed more appropriate, even though a majority isn't technically required."
politics,This is actually way off.
politics,"New Hampshire has a population of 1.36 million. Assuming everyone is registered to vote, and that 22% of that population is registered to vote, then that would mean to get 50% of the vote would require 530,401 votes. That's just an estimate, considering you don't need a majority to get the electoral votes but we'll go with it. The town of Dixville Notch, population 5, constitutes .000943% of that majority population. Since there are 4 electoral votes in NH, that means that this towns votes make up .00377% of an electoral vote.

- ***It breaks [rule 10:](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_10._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.)*** **Self Posts require a descriptive body text.**  
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. This rule is similar to rule 6, it might be even more important for self posts though. A link has content to back it up, with a self post **you** write the content. This means that we expect you to have put in some work yourself as this subreddit is not here to provide answers to (simple) questions but mainly to foster discussion about history.  
  Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer.

springfieldMO,High school.
springfieldMO,"Launch was full as of about three weeks ago. There are a ton of parents switching kids virtual. I have 2-3 making the switch almost every week. 

They had to pull in person teachers just to make it happen so that the kids wanting to go virtual could make the switch. They initially said July was the cutoff, but that is not happening."
springfieldMO,"Are you talking about Hybrid or Launch? We are struggling to stay afloat with Hybrid because it really is a ton of work. 

Launch is not easy. It really is a lot of work; add to that a ton of kids not prepared for that and there will be issues. I have been teaching Launch for awhile now and have a pretty good grip of how to handle it, and even I'm at about a 70% passing right. 

I think part of the problem with Launch is so many teachers are new and don't know how to teach to that style, to get kids motivated or be organized enough to consistently keep parents informed."
springfieldMO,"This will be difficult. I would be surprised if this leads to many of the virtual kids coming back full time. More and more kids are switching to virtual every week, so that would be a strange trend. If anything, larger class sizes may lead some parents to make the switch to virtual. 

And then what do you do? Launch is completely full. They are having to combine classes to move teachers to cover virtual already. A big switch in the middle of the semester is a bad idea."

Arkansas,"If you're from Eastern Oklahoma, Fort Smith is the place to go, so there are a ton of Oklahoma fans there. Fort Smith is not a high class town to begin with, but the people from Oklahoma definitely don't help because Eastern OK is a very run down and poor part of that state. 

Also the people from Fort Smith leave when they graduate. Of people I know, and I'm 10 years out from grad, the people who are successful left for NWA or another state, so the people living there and filling jobs tend to either be from the rural towns outside the Fort or OK."

razorbacks,It was indeed.
Arkansas,"But just so you are aware, the CDC website is actually very clear about where those numbers come from and how they are calculated. The IFR, which is the data point you pointed to and we are looking at, is calculated by taking the number of deaths and dividing that by ALL confirmed cases. 

Once we've done that, we get a ratio which is actually very helpful in some regards and not so helpful in others. Column 5 does give a current best estimate by attempting to estimate the total number of cases. Very difficult to do, because it isn't possible to know the full amount of asymptomatic cases. It is also important to note this data is worldwide and would be irresponsible to use alone when determining the US situation because we are much higher when it comes to deaths per capita than much of the world. 

Of course if you wanted to convert those ratios to a percentage, you just have to multiply them by 100. It's pretty basic data gathering. Glad we were able to have this conversation, I hope you were able to learn something."
Arkansas,"No one expresses batting average as a percent. It's pretty rare. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say 'oh he's batting 30%"". You clearly do not understand the difference between a ratio and a percent, which was my initial point to begin with. 

Batting .300 is a ratio. It isn't a percent. It can easily be converted to a percent, but a conversion does need to happen.....

Which was my initial point about IFR. Game, set, and match."
Arkansas,Oh my god this guy just said batting 300 is a percent.
Arkansas,"I'm sorry that you're struggling to read data. It's actually very clear on that page exactly what the numbers represent and how they got there. School really has failed you, and that's a shame.

I bet you also think a batting average in baseball is a percent."
Arkansas,"You don't know how to read that data, do you? If you aren't concerned by an infection with an ifr of 5% in 70+ and .5% in 50-69, then what are you concerned about? And those are numbers padded with asymptomatic cases, too. We've always known it was less deadly in younger age groups, this doesn't change that at all. This also shows the ifr of Covid is 6.5x more deadly than the flu.

To say that it's less deadly than driving to school is asinine and the data doesn't back that up, unless you're being wilfully ignorant and just talking about rates in children... Which no one does."
Arkansas,"Online classes are only worthless for kids that don't care it weren't they high of a caliber to begin with. The students who actually care about learning, and there are more than you think, are doing just fine."
Arkansas,Then link them.

politics,"So let me get this straight. You call me a liar, and then you are incapable of responding as to what the lie was. Wow."
politics,"Imagine being so fragile that when a celebrity endorses a candidate you don't like, you have to post about how they should stay out of politics."
lotrmemes,Going out for a cheeky Mandos
CFB,"""My Wife's boyfriend sold his prosthetic leg so that Mike Leach would be here"""
politics,"Well, I haven't denied anything. And hypocrisy? On what?

Edit: Well, I gave you a warning. Enjoy your ban."
politics,"I'm denying... What, exactly? Where's the lie?

Also, based on replies you've made to other people in this thread, I will remind you to keep it civil."
HistoryPorn,This is a really cool photo. Someone should colorize it.
politics,"Good lord. 

I will repeat myself because it must not have stuck. The Senate does not have to bring a nomination to a vote. The nomination expires at the end of the legislative session. This is not related in any way to new rules in the last four years, as it has happened on several occasions in our nation's history. 

Refusing to hold a vote is not unconstitutional because it does not say that the Senate is required to do so, just that a vote is required to actually confirm a nominee. It also is not treason, because that is defined in the Constitution (one of the only crimes this is the case). 

I would highly recommend you stop posting misinformation and furthermore, read up on the Constitution and how our government works."
politics,"Everything that you are saying is just showing everyone here that you do not know what you are talking about, and by posting that article, you are showing everyone that you aren't even following the conversation. 

Nothing I have said is a lie, it's all easily verifiable information. Your article doesn't even address what I'm talking about."
politics,I won't disagree that him playing politics is shitty and that a vote should have been had. But McConnell was 100% within his power to deny Obama a vote for a nomination.
politics,"There have been multiple instances of nominations that expired because no vote was taken, going back into the 19th century. 

Again, please do not comment if you aren't able to bring accurate information to the table."
politics,"They actually do not. The Senate is able to postpone vote indefinitely if they so choose, and is able to take no action on a nomination. Doing so causes the nomination to expire at the end of the session.

Please make sure what you are saying is accurate before commenting."
prisonhooch,"Create? No. They break down sugars into alcohols and co2, both of which contain carbon."
politics,"I mean, are you saying that the Senate does not have to confirm a nomination? Because they do, and that's what the consent part is there for"
politics,"Please. You're being naive. None of these picks were stolen, they were by the letter of the Constitution."
politics,How?
politics,This is the reality we get to live in when a large portion of people won't vote because they don't like the candidate.
politics,"Well, article 2, section 2. The Senate has to consent to any pick. It is in no way unconstitutional for the Senate to tell a sitting President that they won't confirm anyone he picks."
AskReddit,"By far his best one shot. Ridiculously good. If anyone wants to try HH without getting into a five episode masterpiece, this is the one to listen to."
AskReddit,"The thing with Pontius Pilate is that for an empire that kept some pretty solid records, he does not appear in the historical record outside of the Bible."
nfl,Did you guys know he went to Harvard
trippinthroughtime,"Fun fact about Frederick the Great. When his father caught him and his gay lover together, he had both of them imprisoned. Frederick's lover was executed outside the tower where Frederick was being held, right outside the window so that he had to watch."
springfieldMO,No you haven't.
missouri,"That would require a full impeachment to remove and isn't likely, or really even warranted because Kavanaugh hasn't committed an impeachable offense."
buildapc,Ryzen 9 3950x
Pomade,I have never heard of this company but I did just see Lockharts announce a collab with them due out in October.
Pomade,Lockharts Light Pomade
PoliticalCompassMemes,"I mean, field of study should play into how much a bank will loan you. Oh you're going into engineering? Here, we are willing to give you a large sum to pay for the whole thing.

Oh, you want to study history? We are only willing to fund this much due to a lower chance you'll be able to pay the loan back."
politics,"That's debatable. It might have happened that way, it might not have."
politics,"In that scenario, thought, that wouldn't be a load of democracy. It would literally be democracy at play: the people not accepting that type of agenda."
politics,"But losing the popular vote does not actually make him illegitimate, because the popular vote literally means nothing. When won based on the rules of the game. You can go and say it's illegitimate because you didn't like the outcome. 

The only solution is to change the rules."
HistoryMemes,Otto is considered to be the first HRE after he defeated the Magyars and was crowned by the pope.
HistoryMemes,"This is a basic bitch meme. Weak attempt. 

Charlemagne was never HRE.

Julius was never emperor."
SubredditDrama,"Yea, and again, science disagrees with you here. I mean, you can feel and believe whatever you want. Go for it. No one is going to stop you there. That does it make it true in reality."
SubredditDrama,"I mean, in a world where definitions can be whatever you want, I guess. 

It isn't a question of whether or not it is or isn't murder. The definitions there are pretty clear. It's just a question of how okay you are with that. All of the other things you're saying are just there to deflect from that."
SubredditDrama,"Again, mental gymnastics. It's a human life. It isn't going to become a dog or a cat randomly. It's certainly human, just as much as a baby or a teenager is a human. It's just at a different stage of development. 

As previously stated, that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with abortion. It is still someone's choice to carry and for most people is easier to justify when it is, as you said, a lump of cells. It is still murder. Just not necessarily wrong. I'm not going to sit here and lie to myself about what is happening, and you shouldn't either."
SubredditDrama,"It absolutely is murder. There really is no getting around that without mental gymnastics. It's the planned taking of a human life. The question is just whether you are okay with that, and at what point or circumstance does it become not okay. I think most people would agree that first trimester unconditionally it's no problem because, like you said, it's take just a clump of cells. After that? Things become circumstantial. Is the mother's life at risk? Is there a defect in the fetus? It really is a complex issue but to say that it's not murder just isn't true. It's just a question of how okay are you with that."
politics,He's right. There is nothing the left can do to stop him.
bestof,"Same. My wife and I are considering Germany at the moment. Obviously that would have to be a post pandemic plan. We've considered emigrating there for several years now, so it's not exactly a reactionary move."
news,They could fill it by next Friday and there is nothing at all that could be done to stop it.
news,They do not have any means to do this. Any nomination has a clear path.
news,That's exactly what is going to happen.
politics,That won't change a thing when they push a nomination through before the election.
politics,A certain group is going to be grave-dancing like there is no tomorrow.
buildapc,"Get a 3080 or a 3070. Pretty unlikely you'll regret it. You may have to wait until the end of the year, but it'll be worth it"
Games,"Yea, I'm doing the same. I'm going to wait until I can get a 3080 or a 3090 then I'll build out everything else from there."
Games,How will a 3080 hold up for this
buildapc,Nah not going to stoop that far. I can wait for the 3080. Or a 3090 if one pops up anywhere.
buildapc,I guess this is a sign I just need to wait and get a 3090.
buildapc,"You are probably right, but it is also important to note that Covid and shutdowns have led to pretty big supply chain issues down the line. That could be causing the shortages as well, and would lead to shortages happening into 2021."
buildapc,Then buy a different card.
CFB,"There are cases of people who have tested positive both in the spring and more recently, but I'm not sure how common that is."
buildapc,Why? Why should they even care? They sold the card and got the money. Why does it matter to whom they sell?
PoliticalCompassMemes,Based. And sad.
springfieldMO,"Don't quote me on this, but I think Salvatore's has eggplant parm. They also have the best fried ravioli I've ever had. It's not the frozen rav from Walmart."
springfieldMO,"Salvatore's is really good, and right off the interstate so it's easy to get to in Ozark from Springfield."
springfieldMO,So good.
CFB,The problem is that it's looking more and more like you can catch it multiple times. There are cases of people who tested positive in the spring and have tested positive again more recently
springfieldMO,T & T is doing Pineapple Whip Beer Floats tomorrow
Pomade,"Can't go wrong with Lockhart's. Goon Grease is great for a heavy hold and high shine. They're normal line of Pomade comes in Light, Medium, and Heavy. Heavy will stay in your hair for days and is a great base, but it also gives a matte finish. The light doesn't have much hold but will give a high shine. Medium is in the middle for both hold and shine. 

I will often use a pomade and then a paste to get some extra volume and hold. Today I used Goon Grease followed up by Antigravity. Works great."
news,I can't imagine Biden would veto a legalization or decriminalized bill if it came across his desk.
ABoringDystopia,"The kids aren't the ones responsible for the debt, so the title is misleading. Their parents are. Many students are in free and reduced lunch. Really, though, school lunch should be free. The whole system is strange and fucked. 

In know right now the USDA if covering lunches and at many schools tight now, breakfast and lunch is completely free for everyone."
worldnews,"The worst part is, there are people who will literally believe this and that those people are in a better place. It's really sad because those people are just... Dead."
SquaredCircle,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/fx55ad/z/fmt22fd
xmen,True on the blue! I didn't notice. Great point. And Nightcrawler was also in Excalibur so they couldve included Kitty.
xmen,"No, that's incorrect. Bishop had not been introduced when these uniforms were used. Cable was I think still doing New Mutants for a few issues. I love these costumes, but they were not around long and were (just barely) pre-Gold and blue teams"
xmen,"She was with Excalibur at the time these uniforms were used. But then again, so was Nightcrawler, and he's there, so idk."
missouri,"At this point, if calling people out for making absolutely ridiculous statements is being an asshole, I'm past the point of caring."
missouri,"If that was actual sarcasm, you need to use an /s tag. It's difficult to detect in writing and also with the ridiculous things some people actually believe."
CFB,Big Ten is going to look like a bunch of clowns if they reverse their decision because of pressure from the people.
missouri,"""the liberal media creates deep fakes or Trump""

You might be one of the dumbest people I have ever interacted with if you believe that."
missouri,Are you saying the tv broadcast added in the boos?
movies,OP didn't post statistics.
movies,"I am a huuuuuge New Mutants fan. I've been waiting on this movie for a long time. I knew it was going to be hot garbage. It was better than Dark Phoenix, though."
nfl,"Oh I live in MO, trust me I know."
nfl,I was only half paying attention when I heard the boos so I didn't know what was going on.
nfl,Wait why were they booing
CFB,"FRT, stay safe out there."
HistoryMemes,"*Borrow 300 gold from Jewish merchants
*Expel the Jewery"
missouri,The beast upon which WW2 was ended. Love it.
missouri,I wonder how the people at Lambert's feel about the dispensary right across the street
missouri,"Definitely a lawyer, that last part gives it away. But certainly not my lawyer."
relationship_advice,"You really need to decide what to do here. You both messed up in different ways here and tanked the relationship. Is that the kind of person that you want to be with? Obviously not. 

What about the child? Which is better? Murder, or letting it grow up in a disfunctional or broken household? That's a decision that needs to be made quickly and is certainly not an easy one."
paradoxplaza,Were you the one that had the character Brian Brian of house Brian or something like that
AskReddit,"Shit, I'd even happily continue to pay the additional $3000 per year if it meant not having to worry about in network providers or insurance denying a claim. Or out of pocket expenses, copays etc."
CFB,"Put it on a picture of Charles II of Spain with the caption ""If I were anymore inbred, I'd be a sandwich."" Post to historymemes, profit."
springfieldMO,The worst part about this are the assholes that block the entrance to Panera trying to get to Dunkin Donuts
CrusaderKings,"That's gonna be an uninstall from me, dog"
chelseafc,Petercrouch
chelseafc,"Stop, I can only get so erect"
chelseafc,Also not sure I want someone on the team that will be busy campaigning for the Presidency
HistoryMemes,And he saw that it was good.
CrusaderKings,The game is still going bro. That's how it works.
CrusaderKings,"Keep going with the tutorial. 867 in Ireland is a much, much more difficult start because Irish counties are all tribal and will get dominated by Norsemen."
CrusaderKings,"It makes a huge difference in Ireland. Tribal vs. feudal government systems, overpowering Viking invasions, different religions, etc. 867 and 1066 are very different start dates."
CrusaderKings,"No, they are not. Tutorial is 1066 start. They're talking about 867."
paradoxplaza,"I think there is. In the game options screen, before starting a new game, you can turn the Mongol invasion off"
paradoxplaza,"Count of Connachta! Eire to start, always."
AskReddit,Can you imagine having the first ever first lady with a sex tape?
nfl,Only 45 rushing yards? What're you an air-raid offense who only runs in at the goal line?
news,"I see what you mean. Her being a porn star shouldn't really matter for us, but it should to conservatives because her past profession goes against the whole socially conservative schtick."
news,"The issue here doesn't lie with Stormy Daniels, but rather with Trump cheating on his third wife. I don't think I've seen anyone upset at Stormy, although I'm sure those people exist."
news,"Dude how dare you. It's ""Ben Shapiro's DOCTOR wife""."
PoliticalCompassMemes,"Yea that whole thing was ridiculous. The reasoning behind allowing for the ten commandments was that the statue was donated. So, using the same reasoning, the satanic temple tried to get baphomet next to it. Denied, and I'm pretty sure there is still a lawsuit ongoing."
springfieldMO,Enforcing masks and social distancing. Two seats in between each party.
PoliticalCompassMemes,"Still can't buy liquor on Sundays in Arkansas. Christians forcing their views on everyone else, I guess."
missouri,Lol this dude is so triggered

imaginarymaps,"Were they though? The US wasn't even in the war until the end of the year. Not that everyone want already expecting them to join in at some point, but still."
PoliticalCompassMemes,If course they will. It's like context doesn't exist.
PoliticalCompassMemes,"In Ben Shapiro's world, waps don't exist."
PoliticalCompassMemes,"Typically it's written WUU and there is no limit to the number of lands that you can control.

But you are correct, it is easy to control more than just land. Creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers are on the table when considered what you can control on your board."
AskReddit,"Add Skyrim to the list, too"
missouri,"No, I get it. There is a ton of misinformation going around."
missouri,Does every thing someone says on here have to have a source posted with it? It's clearly anecdotal. Take it as such.
movies,OH NO DONT DIG IT
politics,"It was a lot easier to rehabilitate Bush because even though we was not a good president, most people would still have considered him a ""good man"" to some extent. Bad president, but still a guy you'd sit down and have a beer with. How many times did you hear that line?

Trump has no shot at that because Trump is human sewage, and people know that. I don't even think most Republicans are able to deny that. So no, I don't think Trump's image will be rehabilitated. Nixon's really hasn't, and Trump will be viewed substantially worse."
springfieldMO,"Thanks for your insight, /u/Anal_Cavities"
politics,She fucking rules.
politics,"Two genuine questions.

1. Are you an actual progressive?

2. Why do you feel alienated by the DNC after this convention?"
politics,Betsy
missouri,"You need to report your school to Dese for that. Planning time is required by law, 250 minutes per week. The threat of the shitstorm that will come down from Dese or possible litigation will get that back real quick."
ABoringDystopia,"I mean, if you aren't eligible for unemployment, then you don't really need it. It has pretty lax but reasonable requirements."
ABoringDystopia,"That is correct. The Senate refused to vote, debate, amend, or do anything with the bill that the House passed in May. When the Senate did decide to begin negotiations on a new bill a few weeks before recess, the Repubs wanted a 1 trillion $ bill. Dems wanted 3 trillion $. Dems offered to meet in the middle at 2 trillion, but Repubs refused to budge.

That is a very very limited and in a nutshell update on what happened for anyone that didn't know."
CFB,Give everyone colored flairs and just fade them as schools drop.
imaginarymaps,"Just fyi I haven't read the book, just watched the door. It's on Amazon prime. Second and third seasons are where it really shines. YEA DIG IT"
imaginarymaps,"It's decent. I wasn't a fan of the last season but the show has a lot of holy shit, really unsettling moments. There are even moments when you find yourself empathizing with a major Nazi and you're just like... Wtf. 

My favorite part was explaining to my wife who many of the characters were in real life.  If you like history, I bet you'll enjoy it."
HighQualityGifs,YEAH DIG IT
CFB,"True, they are always pretty close. We may have lost what.. eight in a row to A&M? But I think adding that game to our schedule over the last ten years has been a net positive."
CFB,"I mean, let's not pretend Arkansas isn't basically a bye week for every team in the SEC."
NintendoSwitch,"Not to mention joycons need to be replaced. At minimum, you need an extra set or a pro controller just to play your switch while you send one set off to be repaurt. I'm sure someone will drop in and say ""I've had a switch for years and never had drift issues :)"" but that is irelevant because drift has been a HUGE and widespread issue."
HistoryMemes,"Ah yes, a move that has retroactively become known as pulling a USA."
springfieldMO,Are evictions back on now?
springfieldMO,I knew it was coming but I just had to let it happen
springfieldMO,Y'all ever notice that dumbass Q guy that comments on nearly every article KY3 posts on Twitter? Patriot1 or something like that. It's always something assinine and half the time is completely off topic.
springfieldMO,What's D's? Never heard of it.
