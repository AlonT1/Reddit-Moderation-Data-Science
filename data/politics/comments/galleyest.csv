politics,"Some countries will issue fines that are a % of your annual income for things like speeding.

Seems more fair. If I was filthy rich why wouldnt I speed everywhere if it only costs me $100? I might change my tune if it cost me personally $14,000."

books,How is this different than indiebound.org?
SelfSufficiency,"Seed to Seed by Suzanne Ashworth is a great book about seed saving if you all are into this.

Beware it reads like a text book at times, but its a great resource.

politics,"Hello! This is generally due to limitations on Reddit's side... Subreddits are limited to a maximum of two sticky slots. This means that when things such as Megathreads and AMAs come up, we need to clear the way for them.

It is not that we do not want to do it, in fact one of my fellow moderators keeps telling me to post stuff in the live thread....

Would it suit you if we had one every day, but left it unsticked during times when we need the slots?"
politics,"What we mean is that if you have articles you feel support this ideology (or any hateful ideology) that are coming from the Daily Caller, or any source, you should report them to us via the modmail action. We have mechanisms available to remove sources from the Approved Domains List.

admincraft,"They are working on it. You can see they have already made the branch here: https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/tree/ver/1.16

Soon! I feel your pain!"
admincraft,"Since you can connect locally, but not over public IP, we know the issue is *likely* limited to the edge of your network.

With that in mind - are you certain the port is actually open? Can somebody from a PC other than your own get a good looking response from this command:`telnet your.public.ip.addr 25565`?

It should basically say anything other than ""connection refused"" or ""could not connect"".

That is where I would start. Also consider what other devices are present in your network edge. Is it straight up fiber > Google device > laptop? Or do you possibly have fiber > Google device > additional routing device > laptop? All are things to consider."

politics,Or the state can just send one to every voter.
politics,To be fair some states let felons votes after X years. See WA.
politics,"Some states have already been doing this for years. Why not ask them how they handle the fraud if they even have any? Additionally, voting online opens up _even more_ security issues. Plethora of holes in software from all sorts of different vendors."
leaves,I appreciate you!!
PoliticalDiscussion,Sorry for the delay! My state tracks you and what you have voted in. You enter your voter registration info and can see previous elections you have also voted in (but not read how you voted if I recall).
PoliticalDiscussion,"WA here. It's super easy. You get a packet with information on everything and who all is running. You have a few weeks to think it over. You then can either drop your sealed ballot into a blue USPS box (postage paid) or drop it off in a secure ballot drop box usually found near libraries, etc.

Edit: you then go to the state/county website and check that's your ballot has been registered as counted."
politics,Lack of testing compared to other nations.

politics,We can do multiple things at once.
politics,I would disagree that it is a privileged thing as thousands upon thousands of less-well-off immigrants are bilingual.
instantpot,"Yes. Your instant pot still wants time to depressurize slowly - opening the valve immediately causes it to depressurize fast. (This won't break things, just makes noise and maybe a mess and some scalding.)

You should notice a timer start after you finish any pressure cooking method. Let this counter go up for a bit before opening the lid or depressurizing manually.

I suggest you retest again and wait some time after the process completes before proceeding."
politics,A cost is a factor. You can say you like something but think it costs too much.
politics,"First paragraph of the article:

AskReddit,"So in normal life there are two layers: reality and your inner thoughts. My first time on LSD had three layers: reality, my inner thoughts, and my point of view at the time (basically behind those two and ""looking"" at them).

I guess in sober reality you have this as well, which would kind of be the way you react to your emotions.

That was trippy."
LateStageCapitalism,To be fair the Obama administration ordered the US Government to move away from private prisons (...at the end of their admin time) and then Sessions cancelled it during the Trump Admin.
politics,Oh. My apologies for misunderstanding you then!
politics,"I have personally had medical staff give me a new doctor because I didn't trust them. Then again they gave me anti-biotics for what turned out to be allergies.

The lowest GPA of a graduating doctor in a class is still called a doctor. You should trust initially, but should also consider the fact they may not be the best for you.

Vaccines, however, is pure science you can research without asking a doctor. They are fine and safe."
politics,"I think the assumption is the doctors who have had pharmaceutical reps visit their office push those particular pills. I don't think this person is saying doctors lie about vaccines.

There is a trope of anti-intellectualiam that is pervasive in parts of US society. This may be what sub-OP was referencing."

I would try the bus method:

Each time an unwanted thought comes to mind picture yourself at a bus stop. This thought is a bus that stops and opens its doors. You do not get on the bus, but rather let it close the doors and drive past. It is goofy, but this visualization really works. Get on a happy bus, like your favorite TV show or recipe.

Understanding that a thought causes you anxiety (""oh no am I a Nazi?"") means you probably are not such - or at the very least introspective enough to change your life to improve yourself.

AskReddit,"Today I went to a buffet. I asked for a box to take what was left on my plate home, and told that would incur a charge as it was buffet food, not off the menu. I then asked, essentially ""so it costs more to take it home than throw it away?""

The answer was yes. I do not trust buffets."

INEEEEDIT,"Apparently it seems ok: 

>Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called raw cream butter. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for several months, raw cream butter has a shelf life of roughly ten days.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter

But apparently there are mixed signals on this:

>Keeping butter in an airtight container like a crock makes butter last at room temperature longer (about 2 weeks), but when room temperature rises above 70° F, all butter should be refrigerated.

>Salted and unsalted butter are not the same, however: Salt in salted butter makes it less susceptible to bacterial growth, so it should be fine out on the counter. Even so, salted butter will last only about a week before going rancid, according to John Bruhn at University of California, Davis, so it’s best to keep out only what you’ll use within a few days. On the other hand, unsalted butter is best refrigerated.

OCD,"I have found the methods outlayed in this book to be very effective in dealing with the anxiety that obsessive thoughts cause.

Essentially the method is that you use mindfulness (simply being aware of yourself) techniques to allow thoughts that come to mind to float away. The author likens them to allowing the monsters to stay at your house, but they are not allowed to eat.

Anyways, its worth a look and it helped me. You can buy it or torrent it, whatever.

OCD,"Just say this is your mind saying these things, not you. Its part of our disease. But I believe in you :)"
OCD,"We go through the same thing. I worry that I have a deadly disease all. the. time.

But recently I've found meditation/mindfulness and allowing myself to allow the thoughts to exist without feeding them helps. Its not fool-proof (yet) but its helping a little.

Don't wish cancer on yourself.

Also, enjoy the fact that magical thinking doesn't actually affect the outside world. You can do 1,000,000 compulsions to turn a pink rose blue, but it will still be pink.

I know I haven't quiet figured out how to safely ignore all of my thoughts, but I'm getting there. I'm certainly better than when I was a kid.

Check this book out for some great tips: https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1510090361&sr=8-1&keywords=chade+meng+tan

OCD,"Sorry for the delay! If I had gotten back sooner maybe you could have quit sooner :/

So I have been free for the year basically. I have had a few days of relapse - mainly when I visit my old college friends.

As for quitting...lots of suffering basically. I hate to use that word, but yeah. I also have OCD centered around my health and cancer, so you can see how that got to me and why I ended up quitting.

Basically one tip is this: you just need to quit. But maybe allow yourself something comforting in the meantime? Like: ""I cannot have cigarettes today, but I can watch as much Netflix as I want because I am quitting today."" Sort of deal. Just don't let yourself go overboard I guess.

Godspeed fellow OCDer. I know you can quit the smoking. I also know you can conquer the OCD. Living with OCD gets better, it really does."
