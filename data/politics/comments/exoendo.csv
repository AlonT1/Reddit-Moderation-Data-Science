read what I said again. Also it's stupid to compare politics now to 30+ years ago. We are far more polarized today.

>Trump lost by the second biggest popular vote margin in decades. How does that feel, you pathetic sore loser bitch? 

A) talking about raw numbers is misleading. Population always grows in 4 years. % wise it's not the biggest margin. Also I don't care at all, I didn't vote for him. You on the other hand come across incredibly insecure. 

We are in the middle of a pandemic and global recession, dems were projected to pick up 6+ seats and they got absolutely reamed.

>* “We need to not ever use the word ‘socialist’ or ‘socialism’ ever again. . . . We lost good members because of that,” Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who narrowly leads in her reelection bid, said heatedly. “If we are classifying Tuesday as a success . . . we will get f---ing torn apart in 2022.”

>* Other centrists, including Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas, made similar points. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Florida Democrat who suffered an unexpected loss to a Republican challenger, argued through tears that the party’s infighting on Twitter needs to stop.

>* Democrats are poised to hold the smallest majority in 18 years, undercutting the leverage of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The rancor on Thursday’s call is certain to be more pronounced next year as the party faces the tougher task of uniting to pass legislati

>* “I also want to say the thing we’re all feeling: I’m furious,” she said. “Something went wrong here across the entire political world. Our polls, Senate polls, gov polls, presidential polls, Republican polls, public polls, turnout modeling and prognosticators all pointed to one political environment — that environment never materialized.”

This is like saying ice cream is cold. It's a completely banal and pointless observation. It's undemocratic by design. It's not meant to represent the fickle will of the uninformed masses when it comes to constitutional law. It exists as a check and balance and is insulated from electoral politics by design so we dont have judges voting on things just based on what is popular in the cultural zeitgeist at the time.

Right - and the legislative branch created those very laws in the first place. So  lets clarify your position - you want to get rid of the supreme court for all the bad it has done, but you want to give all the power to the legislature even thoguh it is that very same legislature that brought  laws like jim crow into existence.

bon_appetit,"the lowering of the poverty rate and the rise of social rights and general progress of humanity has been exponential and unprecedented in human history and it all started with the implementation of capitalism. It is responsible for more good in the world than literally anything else in the last 400 years.

>For most of recorded history, humans had very slowly rising living standards, but then material progress suddenly exploded:

>As the chart makes clear, our current living standards vis-a-vis the nobles at the Palace of Versailles is not merely due to routine technological inventions; the progress in the last few centuries is literally unprecedented. In a 2016 New York Times column, economic historian Deirdre McCloskey explains the astonishing surge in economic growth in this way:

>[A] mere idea, which the philosopher and economist Adam Smith called “the liberal plan of equality, liberty and justice.” In a word, it was liberalism, in the free-market European sense. Give masses of ordinary people equality before the law and equality of social dignity, and leave them alone, and it turns out that they become extraordinarily creative and energetic.

bon_appetit,"> Men are stereotyped as violent and criminal - particularly Black and brown men - in a way women aren't.

yes but as I said, the stat I cited is the same across racial lines as well as socio-economic lines and age. So that talking point really doesn't cut it.

Men also have more testosterone which results in increased competitiveness, aggression, and risk taking. Once one moves 2-3 standard deviations above the mean popoulation looking at these factors it's almost all men as the outliers in these categories, which is the main reason our prisons are populated the way they are. If we just looked at systemic inequities though we wouold never solve the underlying issue. Our prisons will never have 50% women because women do not commit crime at the same rate men do. They just don't. That's why it's important to not just extrapolate a conclusion based solely on observable inequities. There are always going to be many factors at play.

>Maybe inequities in an institution are not conclusive proof in and of themselves of inherent systemic biases. But they are compelling evidence of it.

Well this is the type of nuance I appreciate.  Yes, we can both agree on that. It should give us pause when we see these things, but it's important not to go all in on merely one factor and realize many of the problems in our society are multi-faceted."
bon_appetit,from what I heard they were already in discussions because sohla was helping to develop 3 pilots with them. it's likely she would have gotten a contract anyway if this didn't blow up. we can only speculate though.

bon_appetit,what's so funny about that? The video stats were posted on here not too long ago. that's just the truth of the matter
bon_appetit,"NYT opinions page is not evidence of systemic racism. FYI, I am not wholesale denying it's existence, but all too often people assume the reason for inequity in a society MUST be a systemic issue, and this is simply not true. **Inequities within an institution are not conclusive proof in of themselves of inherent systemic biases.** For example, lets look at the fact that 95% of males, across all races and socio-economic brackets, make up our prison population. Using your logic, that would be absolute proof that there is a systemic institutional bias against men in our society and the only way we will have known we have achieved equality and fairness is when our prison population includes 50% women. This is obviously a ridiculous assertion."
bon_appetit,"> why are they being paid less than Carla et al.?

because they still didn't get as many views as carla, and also they have been under the BA umbrella for less time overall. Seniority has played a large factor in all of this.

>Every institution in the US perpetuates structural racism, including the restaurant and journalism industries. 

saying something is real and proving it is real are two different things. If it was as tangible as everyone claims it to be, the problems would be easily isolated and worked on. This is never the case though. It's hard to define by design so a problem can perpetuate to exist without end."
bon_appetit,">We already know that the folks at BATK don't have control over what content they produce for the TK. So if the audience isn't into her recipes,

this is not true all the time. They may not have exclusive control, but they do come up with their own ideas as well.

And again this says nothing of ones personality or how they come across on camera. Some people just work better on camera than others. Priya would have -40% the views deviating from the average. That is a huge discrepancy. If racism was the only thing determining this then we should expect to see similar numbers from rick and sohla, but this isn't the case. Sohla got reasonably ok numbers compared to priya 

>we know that structural racism exists in general and in the food world and in BATK and in BATK viewership,

bon_appetit,they have low traffic because they are literally not putting anything out. Of course their numbers would be down.
bon_appetit,how can you prove the audience is racist? we have a very small sample size of people here. Maybe priya is just boring? Maybe the vast majority of the audience aren't into the recipes she makes Is that something so beyond peoples comprehension here?
bon_appetit,"they HAVE been unreasonable. They dont pull in the views, they dont deserve more money. If you make less money for a company, you don't deserve the same as those that bring in more.

So for me if I need to get serious work done, it's desktop, and when I need to get work done on the go I can still use the ipad though it's a bit less convenient, but that inconviencne is balanced out for all the other things I want it for. So in my case the ipad was the right call. It's going to be different for everyone"

You dont get it becasue you spend all your time on this sub, instagram, and twitter. Your views dont even represent 5% of the youtube audience, who are more than content to just watch videos that entertain them. Most people do not care about the politics or social aims of the content they consume.

Hunzi has even come back. Hunzi has bent the knee. Many of the former hosts will still be there, especially the ones that were actually bringing in all the money and views. It turns out, when you have all the hosts that make you all the money and views still on your side, you are in pretty good shape. Additionally, there will be some new ones that come in, and they wont have missed a beat. That is the truth of it. CN has done all this because they can."

bon_appetit,"Op if people loved them they wouldn’t have abysmal viewing numbers. Priya is the least popular on the channel with -40% deviation from the average. There is no reward to be had with priya 

Why would they spend time and money developing talent when they already have guaranteed money makers? Especially when the talent they’d be developing has already been proven to not be popular? 

Sohla rocks though. Rick is good too. Sadly they both don’t get very good numbers (sohla might, I forget)"

bon_appetit,"based on the scant evidence you have provided, that's where we are right now. I would of course always be willing to have more evidence provided. I don't think sohla getting the opportunity to develop 3 shows for hself and a 20% pay bump is much of an indication though. 

Also I suppose you'll continue to brush over your massive hyperbole of sohla working harder than everyone else (something you never backed up) and have dropped the fact that the other people at CN had all worked there much longer than her. Guess you conceded those arguments to me."
bon_appetit,"Yes, she was on video. She was also given a 20% raise for said videos, and was actively being promoted to be one of the next big stars on their youtube channel with active development of 3 separate pilots. Pretty sweet gig. All in under a year."
bon_appetit,"> again, you have such a beautiful way to try to spin that she was demanded to do mounds of additional work for zero pay, while other ""stars"" got lucrative contracts for similar work.

no one had a gun to her head. You are ignoring her 20% pay bump. That compensates her for her time developing shows that would dramatically benefit herself in the end. You act as though she would have received nothing from having her own show. Why should she be paid for something that doeosn't even exist? She was actively in the process of developing something. 

>Since you think it's such an honor to be systematically discriminated against, I'll give you the secret: just be undermined at every turn, such that you aren't allowed into the roles and jobs you are qualified for. So you have to be underpaid, taking positions you are overqualified for, and thus make less money than the White counterparts that you end up having to support and teach... in a supposed meritocracy. 

No evidence she was undermined at every turn. You are just making stuff up.

Maybe she shouldn't have opened a restaurant that failed (90% of restaurants fail their first year, you probably think that was racist too though in spite of the statistics). That's not BA's fault.

>Then, you just have to exasperate yourself demanding raises to get what smug anti-intellectuals call a ""massive raise"" just to get a bit closer to pay equity with others **who don't work as hard or aren't as qualified.**

Now you are literally pulling stuff out of your ass.

Seriously, citation needed. Please prove claire, brad or chris don't work as hard as sohla. You are grasping at straws now, trying to fill up your post with words without saying anything substantial or quantifiable.

>I'll take note that this here is when I learned that completely whacked out people think systematic racism is such a fun life to experience.

It most certainly is when you get the opportunity to develop 3 separate shows and receive a (yes massive) pay bump in under 1 year. She was given many opportunities and would have had even more."
bon_appetit,">Among them, quite literally that ""seniority"" and salaries are independent of the standing any stakeholder has in any other business unit at Conde Nast. 

Is this you conceding that the talent obviously worked at these companies longer than sohla et al? Because that's what it reads like to me.

Fact - brad, claire, molly etc all worked at CN, and the production company longer than sohla had. People that work at a place longer typically are going to make more money and be the first to have opportunities to do things. Same as it is with every company in basically the entire world.


>Sohla literally has no contract with CNE, and this is now very amusing watching you throw mud in all directions to obscure that you have no coherent logic that you can string together when somebody does critical thinking and looks at all the facts.

she was in the process of obtaining a contract when covid hit. Again, it's very peculiar a system that wholesale discriminates against a person is actively working to develop 3 separate shows in which she would star on a massively popular youtube channel and also received a 20% pay bump in less than a year.

>watching you throw mud in all directions to obscure that you have no coherent logic 

you are projecting. Please continue ignoring that most all other employees had worked for the company way longer than sohla and that there are a multitude of variables that can explain all of this without it being systemic racism. A systemic issue that is not quantifiable, subjective, not falsifiable, open to interpretation, and obviously sparse enough as to not be able to be brought to any court in spite of racist discrimination in an organization already being against the law"
bon_appetit,">Interesting way to try to now minimize that certain people are signed to lucrative contracts, while someone like Sohla, who both asked and asked about the same opportunity, while audiences were clamoring about the same, was consonantly brushed off.

She was not brushed off. She was given a 20% pay bump and was developing 3 seperate pilots after only 10 months of working there. I wish I could be systemically discriminated against if it meant I was working on developing 3 shows starring myself and receiving a massive raise in under a year

>That you have to keep conflating the Bon Appetit salaries, with the fact that certain white chefs got CNE contracts, while Sohla got $00,000.00 from CNE (again, a completely different business unit with it's own balance sheet

you are deflecting. The production company was started only recently, with the same people working there that work at CN. It's its own thing for legal and financial reasons. Even if we were to go with your take, brad still would have been part of this company for years longer than sohla. So in the end, my point stands, the people that where there longer get paid more - shocking! Just like basically every other company in existence!

You continue to ignore the vast multitude of factors that could have contributed to all of this. I urge you to have some intellectual vigor and not just argue with me in bad faith."
bon_appetit,">And, there's that anti-intellectualism again. Tell us how your beloved Brad, a test kitchen manager fits into this? Or Claire, who completely quit her job as an editor before signing to CNE? 

First of all, none of this is ""anti-intellectualism"" - you sound like an idiot when you use words haphazardly. 

Just because it's a different company on paper, it's functionally the same place. Is it so beyond your comprehension that people that have been working in the same building, same office, knowing the same people that cross pollinate between the two might be given first crack at something? Is your mind completely blown into the stratosphere that someone that has worked there 10 months might not be paid the same as a person that has worked there 9 years (or even 2-3 if you want to just pretend the production company is like from mars or something?)

Is that really hard for you to understand? Is it so hard for you to understand others might be better on camera, or pull in more views? That's difficult as well? You literally can't even admit to the other factors that can be at play here? You are being willfully ignorant.

>Everybody looking at the facts ""objectively"" sees you are desperately trying to piece together a narrative that explains away the racism, exactly as we know Conde Nast is trying to do right now

The only one trying to explain things away is you. I never even DENIED there COULD be some elements of systemic racism, I merely said it was not conclusive and there are plenty of other explanations - yet you are a individual that starts with a conclusion first and then cherry picks whatever evidence is beneficial to serving your narrative."
politics,good luck with that. The GOP have an inbuilt senate advantage given there are far more red states than blue states and given enough time they'll get their rounds in as well.
bon_appetit,">Please keep doubling down on your ignorance and anti-intellectualism, 

You keep using words that I think you have a very poor grasp on what they actually mean.

>Anti-intellectualism is hostility to and mistrust of intellect, intellectuals, and intellectualism, commonly expressed as deprecation of education and philosophy and the dismissal of art, literature, and science as impractical, politically motivated, and even contemptible human pursuits.

where have I done that anywhere in our exchange? You are the one that keeps harping on things you can't even prove or clearly define.

>) that solely signs people to contracts for the one and only job to be YouTube talent, and has their own budget / balance sheet to account for, independent of how long anybody contractee has worked in any other division of the corporation.

Correct and they happen to sign people that have been with the company the longest, who pull in the most views, and have other jobs including senior food editor which allows them to both film and create recipes for the magazine, as opposed to say priya who is freelance and not someone that would be signed for a full time filming gig when they are barely on the premises anyway. This all seems foreign to you?

>Tell us all about the ""not subjective"" factors that systemically racist institutions have always used to justify that the pay disparities that coincidentally fall along racial lines

Correlation is not causation. Just because 1-3 PoC might be paid less does not mean that this is evidence of racism. You keep putting your fingers in your ears and closing your eyes to the FACT that many of these people simply haven't been with CN as long as others, may not pull as many views, and a whole host of other reasons. Keep ignoring it. Keep ignoring the fact that it's already illegal to discriminate against race and if you had anything objective here, they would be able to sue on grounds of discrimination. 

>and why the VP of Video for Conde Nast who has leadership over CNE has literally resigned

Almost entirely PR, and the need to have a good symbiotic relationship with management and employee. You can't run a company with management being completely ineffective.

Lets recap: I have presented objective evidence that would explain pay disparity. You have provided zero objective evidence of anything. Furthermore, you continue to not even acknowledged how these issues can be multifaceted, which again, should be entirely obvious."
AnnePro,will this fix the abysmal bluetooth issue this keyboard has?
bon_appetit,"It is not subjective that some employees worked there longer than others, or have different job descriptions than other employees, or literally work different jobs (freelancer vs. senior editor) that would result in different pay.

Nothing I said was contradictory. The things I pointed out are not mutually exclusive.

If any of what you were saying were true, they would be able to sue conde nast. I hate to blow your mind right now, but guess what, it's already illegal to discriminate based on race! So if there were clear objective instances of this actually happening, they would have an ironclad case. The fact that there is no such case makes it self evident that your claims of ""systemic racism"" are subjective and unproven.  In contrast, length of employment or different job descriptions are not subjective, and is a common reason for pay disparity across every institution in america."
bon_appetit,"I am not doubling down on anything. You have provided no evidence that BA is ""corrupt"" as you have categorized above. You are the one deflecting in this conversation. I have given you clear, concise, objective and readily identifiable reasons why some people would be paid more. These factors are normal, ethical, moral, and legal at every company in existence, and you continue to pretend that these factors don't even exist."
bon_appetit,"I dont see anything you are saying that is material. I have said there are many factors at play, these are clear, objective, obvious, and something that happens at every company in existence. Your answer .. is... what, exactly?"
bon_appetit,"it's very telling that people that work at a company for a decade will get paid more than people that have worked there less than a year?

Claire/molly et al were long time senior editors. That doesn't matter either?"
bon_appetit,"it's not really beyond the realm of possability with it being a coincidence when we are dealing with such a small sample size of people. We are literally talking about less than a dozen. 'Coincidentally,' many of these PoC are newer to the company, and also some CHOOSE to be freelance (like priya) which obviously is going to come with a different pay structure.

It's so EASY to just say ""systematic racism"" without looking at a situation critically, but it's clear many separate factors can be at play here. Again, why are you surprised someone like brad who has worked at BA for 9 years might be paid more than sohla who had worked there for 10 months?"
bon_appetit,"it can be a mixture of both. Some could be paid because of seniority, others for merit, some a combination of the two.  None of that is contradictory."
bon_appetit,"it's not mind boggling at all.

You assume it has to do with race, other than the fact that rick and priya are freelancers, and sohla had only worked there for 10 months.

Is it common at where you work for people that have been there less time to make the same amount of money? Is that true literally anywhere else on the planet? No. it's not.

Brad for example worked there for 9 years. There are so many other factors that go into this, including seniority, base talent, ability to pull in views, etc."
bon_appetit,"so let me get this straight, their video views went down when they havne't done any videos for a month and a half?"

bon_appetit,"you can't say the evidence is conclusive and also admit this stuff is hard to prove. No, the evidence is not conclusive. If there were actual racism at the company, they could be sued. That's against the law. The very concept of ""strucutral racism"" is almost impossible to prove, which means it's not conclusive. I have already listed many different ways that would explain the issues that were going on at the company. There is no reason to believe your claims of structural racism more than there is to accept that it was due to seniority at the company or a whole host of other variables."
bon_appetit,"I didn't dismiss evidence. I said it was not conclusive, and that there could be many reasons why the situation is as it is, and in fact it's far more likely it's the way I say it is because I can point to multiple other variables that would affect this outcome. If I can point to multiple concrete variables (such as seniority, talent/ability, traffic metrics, fast youtube growth) it's hard to take accusations of hard to prove (by your own admission) systemic issues seriously. 

But that's the whole point, isn't it? Those that claim structural racism aren't actually interested in laying out the facts or getting to the truth of the matter. Instead we trade concrete objective reality for subjectivity and anecdotes. Truth seems to matter little here, instead people just want an agenda pushed. That's not an honest way to have a conversation. Nor does it serve anyone well in the long run."
bon_appetit,"there are plenty of other explanations than just saying ""because racism""

the only people that got paid were the ones that had their own show. no one got paid for the other stuff, white people included.The people that had their own shows were almost all white, true - but they were also at the company the longest. Brad was there 9 years. sohla was there 10 months. Could there perhaps been a reward for seniority? 

It's so easy to just say ""it's racist"" without critically thinking things through or considering other alternatives. But it's intellectually lazy.

This is to not say there WASN""T racism, I am just saying there isn't much evidence for it on a systematic level at BA. Anyone saying otherwise are trying to fit this into a per-ordained conclusion."
bon_appetit,"you are the one twisting things. Look at actions, not words. BA brought in one of the toughest union busting firms, suspended hunzi, and everyone is now radio silent."
bon_appetit,I don't really care what a multi million dollar company says for PR reasons and damage control. That's not proof of anything. If they really believed that they wouldn't have hired a tough as nails union busting firm
bon_appetit,"No, we literally do not know. Many people haven't even talked for a month. Just because some people claimed something, doesn't mean it is true.

For example, it's just by sheer coincidence I suppose that the people getting paid were the people that had their own shows and seperate contracts with CN, and guess what, those people also happened to be working at the company the longest. Seniority is a pretty common thing in every work environment all over the world. SO were they getting paid because of seniority or racism? There is just as much evidence, if not more so, that they were getting paid for seniority reasons. This is just one example.

As I said before, an inequity within a system is not proof in of itself of systemic bias.

There are many reasons that can explain their pay structurues."

bon_appetit,">paid less because they are both new

how the hell is that BA's fault? Value isn't determined by the Value Squad at the Value Center on Value Street. It's determined by the market. If sohla was worth more than 50k initially then someone else would have seen that value and hired her instead. THis is basic economics. Sohla accepted the 50k job because that's what she thought she was worth. That's her decision. CN aren't the bad guys for merely offering a salary that another adult agreed to. 

Secondly, its not BA's fault the stars didn't align and they didn't meet their more recent employees earlier a decade ago. That's not evidence of systemic racism.

>and revealed clearly the dynamics and mechanisms that showed that the process was racist.

Well I mean you showed me a screenshot with literally no context so I can't comment on what I can't see."
bon_appetit,">until white people are willing to give up some of the privileges that they are afforded.

We are talking about Brad and Claire. What specific and objective things can you point to that they have in their jobs solely because of systemic racism? Why can't we say it's just as easily could be time having worked at BA, or their unique ability to pull an audience, or any number of things? An inequity in a system is not proof of systemic issues inherent to a system.

>Why is it okay for BIPOC to suffer but when it’s white people then all of a sudden it’s sick? In a perfect world, no one would suffer. This world isn’t perfect, and if we want everyone to be treated equally, white people need to stop being defensive about the privileges that allowed them to get where they are.

I agree no one should suffer. I agree we should reduce harmful institutions. I dont think expecting white people to sacrifice the security of their job when they have children who are about as innocent as could be need to suffer in that endeavor.

It's a negative line of thinking, and not productive.  Life doesn't have to be a zero sum game."
bon_appetit,">How weird that the ""perceived value"" correlates with the BATK's staffs' race...

That's a hard thing to prove. It seems one could argue such discrepancies are just as every bit correlated to time previously having been employed by BA. Seems most of the people being paid more money have been at the company the longest. It's also an entertainment company, so some people will naturally be better at being on camera. Maybe priya wouldn't be able to carry a whole show. Maybe Alex can. 

Note, I am not saying that there isn't valid discussion around employees getting paid more. But part of the appeal of the test kitchen was it was normal staff popping in and out of videos while doing their normal editing job. Then it got huge and people got their own shows. Not everyone deserves their own show. That's CN's call. Anything outside that scope can be done on a per video basis but then you get into nitty gritty like do you pay for every small cameo, or a few lines of dialogue? or time on screen? You would have to start delineating really odd stuff and sometimes things would be left on the editing room floor. Those aren't easy solutions especially for a rapidly growing company to have all sorted out, as thus I circle back to my point that there are more reasons at play in this situation than just ""systemic racism""

You can't just point to a singular inequity in a system and just attribute the inequity solely to race. That's no different than a religious person not understanding the full scope of existence they are in and declaring god must have done it. It's a claim that is completely unfalsifiable."
bon_appetit,"Your criteria is completely nebulous and unrealized. You can't just tell white people they aren't allowed to have jobs anymore. You seem to be focused on tearing people down, rather than lifting others up. It is a perverse worldview, and completely totalitarian.

Do you not hear yoursel? You are saying people literally have to SUFFER for your ideology to come to fruition. That's sick."
bon_appetit,Just because you can't discriminate on specific criteria does not mean you are not allowed to set any salary you want when hiring someone. If that was the case companies would never be able to negotiate salaries. All the law says is that you can't discriminate based on sex/race etc. That says nothing of an employers ability to discriminate based on perceived value.
bon_appetit,No one forced her to take the job. CN should be free to offer whatever salary they want when hiring someone. That doesn't make them bad that they found someone willing to accept what they chose to pay them
bon_appetit,"> and why should they suffer, how will anything ever change? 

so in other words, one MUST suffer for change. That seems like a really dark worldview to me. I don't believe everything has to be zero sum like that. 

There is no proof this is a systemic racism problem. It could just as easily be a systemic class problem, or a systemic HR problem. An inequity in a system is not conclusive proof of systemic biases inherent in such a system."
bon_appetit,"no from what I have been able to gather, basically you have two types of video categories. You have those with a ""main show"" i.e. chris, brad, claire, andy, molly, and then you have those videos where all chefs are answering questions. Then of course you sometimes have a couple other one off cooking episodes sprinkled in.

I think the main issue that happened is that the youtube channel grew really fast. Originally, the actual editors for the magainze were doing their normal jobs with sometimes being on video. This was seen as part of the job. Then a while later the channel is blowing up really quickly. CN, separate from BA, starts signing separate contracts for contracted video work. People that had a ""main show"" got paid ""main show"" money. Multiple people were getting phased in over time. It took chris 2 years to get a show after claire had hers. This is what people mean when they say POC weren't getting paid. 

Sohla after being at the company in less than one year had gone from a sole editor role to actively working on developing 3 pilots and receiving (which she would have received money as soon as one was picked up) and a 20% pay bump. To me, that sounds like a great deal of opportunity in a very short time. I find it hard to believe a systemically racist system would be so proactive in developing such things."
bon_appetit,she was already working with CN developing a show for herself. Way before any of this stuff went down. One of them was on BA maybe a month or so back. They were basically going to go live with one of them in short order. It was talked about in one of the initial interviews.
bon_appetit,"brad started at BA as a dishwasher and has been there for like 9 years. Sohla in 10 months had already received a 20% salary bump and was making 3 pilots. Doesn't seem like to me she was getting shafted because of brad. how can we know or possibly conclude this happened because of their race and not due to seniority and having been prior editors at the magazine?  who is to say brad and claire don't deserve their jobs, or that they somehow got it by stepping over a POC? Those are completely erroneous conclusions to draw. 

Why should well meaning people have to lose their jobs when they have done nothing wrong and have brought concrete value to the company in terms of making something the viewers liked watching, something that made people happier, and something that made money for the company?

A lot of this talk is very dogmatic and lacks a lot of nuance. It's a poor way to look at the world"

Every complaint boils down to ""why didn't I have a video series like claire"" - that's not structural racism lol. If that's the case lets just give everyone at CN a show! Racism solved!"
bon_appetit,"systematic racism is completely non-falsifiable. There is no one thing anyone can point to that is the ""systemic issue"" in an organization. If CN granted the employees everything they asked for, they would still not claim the problem to ever be fixed. One has to ask, why is that? The reason why that is is because the concept doesn't exist to be fixed, but to put others in a perpetual state of wrongness where anything they say or do can be dissected and contorted to mean whatever someone else wants it to mean. 

It's not racist to have someone signed on as an editor making cameos in vids and not paying them when it's never been in their contract. I am sure those employees could have chosen not to be in the videos at any time.

Instead, they were given exposure, the ability to grow a following, in sohlas case a 20% pay bump within 1 year, and was actively developing 3 pilots one of which surely would have been picked up. To me, that sounds like a pretty good deal."
bon_appetit,"you don't just get license to declare something as truth just because you are BIPOC. If there is something concrete, point to it.

Furthermore, many of the complaints have been over monetary issues, which again, was also true for white employees when they didn't have their own show as well. It was routine procedure to have editors have dual jobs with editing the magazine and working on video.  and as I have already pointed out, sohla got a 20% pay raise in 10 months as well as the ability to develop 3 distinct pilots for the show."
bon_appetit,"they weren't racist. 

Not many racist companies give someone like sohla free exposure, a 20% pay bump, and the ability to develop 3 pilots (one of which would almost surely be picked up) within the span of 10 months. Sohla was not treated unfairly at all.

technology,"Im quite sure that if bezos didn't create amazon, there wouldn't be a job at amazon. pretty sure that's not ideology."
technology,"damn, well in that case they should go build a new amazon then. they'll put bezos out of work in no time."
technology,"the worth of ones labor is determined by market forces. If the workers were worth more, they'd have better jobs or better opportunities. it is that simple. bezos can pay them what they accept. if it wasn't for bezos, they wouldn't even have the amazon job."
technology,it is immoral to demand more than one is worth at swordpoint. that is extortion and stealing.
technology,">You then go on to act like Amazon are clearly going about things the right way by abusing this terrible situation, paying people fuck all, 

this is where we disagree. Is it not abuse to pay people their market value for their labor. It is the fair price. Businesses exist to make money, they are not a social welfare program.

>You act like this is a good thing.

it's neither good nor bad. It is amoral."
technology,yes i am a politics mod
technology,"i didn't say someones overall worth. I was talking about our labor worth. People are obviously worth more than their job skills, but that worth doesn't have much to do with an employer."
technology,i didn't say that at all?
technology,"I don't believe an employer is a charity. We are all paid what we are worth, our worth as far as our labor is concerned is dictated by the market. There is no conspiracy to underpay people. If people were worth more then there would be a company willing to pay for those services. If people are not willing to pay for those services, then it is what it is. No one is entitled to extort more money than they are actually worth. In that sense they would end up being overpaid, and that is what would be unfair."
technology,in that case it looks like amazon set their wages accurately then
technology,"if the workers feel they are undervalued and that there is a better, higher paying market for their skills, by all means they should leave their current job and go get paid what they deserve."

DefendingJacob_TV,"no, it's actually moronic and a huge waste of time. The show had far too many (obvious) red herrings. Certain stories can pull it off. For example the movie doubt is built around ambiguity - but they do a much better job with it because doubt was the theme and we know that going in. On this show, the audience isn't really in the headspace of having this be an ambiguous story. They drag it out multiple episodes, they alluded to derek, patz, they have sarah being suspicious, all of that adds up to nothing. It's not like it tells us anything important or does it in an imaginative way. There isn't even very compelling arguments for either side. It's not like it stirs debate. It's just lazy writing."
Foodforthought,it was pretty ignorant for cuomo to put covid patients in nursing homes which was one of the highest places for death in the nation. If one factors our NY we really didn't do that bad and we were very much similar to most of europe.

politics,There was a poll released a few days ago that showed biden up 17 pts with registered voters over the age of 65. Trump was +7 with them in 2016.  Biden is leading 2:1 with women. Biden is +8pts in enthusiasm.  Bernie wasn't anywhere close to those numbers.
politics,"rasmussen typically polls likely voters. samples of likely voters skews more conservative. likely voter samples are more accurate in general though than registered voters or ""adults"""
AskReddit,the finale was sort of retconning his past actions because vince didn't think he made it clear enough that he wanted walt to be bad
survivor,"sarahs argument is pretty stupid. Tony played better than her this season, and she played aggressive her last season and go the respect of the jury. Usually the criticism isn't women are too aggressive in survivor, but the exact opposite. People criticized michelle because they thought of her as a goat and preferred aubrey (a convenient fact that people seem to forget that when people think michelles win sucked, it's because they preferred the other woman instead, but somehow that is sexist)"

Medici_Netflix,..watch more tv
survivor,"maybe michelle just isn't very good? she had no control of the votes this time around. Also when people throw shade at michelle for her first season, it's because they preferred aubrey. that's hardly sexist."
scotus,the idea of guns as a prevention against tyranny assumes the measures you mentioned have already been exhausted. it's a position of last resort.
AskReddit,nah the internet in the last 20 years has been transformative and we are in a much better spot today
scotus,"how did afghanistan or vietnam go for us even though we had superior weaponry on our side? War often has a very large political element to it.

If we were ever in a situation where there was a mass uprising, there are 300 million guns in america. Our government can't enforce it's will on a day to day level from an f-16. They need to make arrests, they need to go door to door, they need police. It would be full on guerilla warfare in our cities. Tyranny would be very hard to enforce. Additionally, there is a strong argument to make that any lacking firepower woould be augmented after rusing local military bases to acquire even more firepower, much like how during the french revolution they stormed the bastille to acquire gunpowder and cannon

While the government has nukes, they would have to be nuking their own cities that they want producing viable economic output once the war is over. That would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.

Lastly, the mere threat of countless carnage, death, destruction, and a well armed resistence can be thought of as a very strong check to prevent overreach."
vaporents,there is plenty left after vaping. it can last for years. I took about 1/2 a tsp of abv recently that was pretty brown and it sent me soaring for a good solid 10 hours. use an ARGo and a grasshopper

survivor,im just having fun and throwing shade at sandra stans
survivor,KING tony YAAAASSSSSS KINNNNG
survivor,to be fair this logic could apply to any final 3. it actually makes me wonder if some of the weird close wins in the past was because some people voted for someone they wanted to have second and didn't coordinate their votes correctly and ended up crowning the wrong winner by accident lol
Foodforthought,"the economy is pretty essential too.

also it's not either or. they could have done a better job with it, sterilizing, etc"
Foodforthought,"NYC should be pittied. It's a shame deblassio encouraged people to go to parades in mid march and cuomo didn't get around to dealing with the subways which was the primary spreader of the virus and stuck the elderly covid patients in nursing homes all the way through may. Pretty sure subtracting out NYC our results would be much better

edit: downvoted in foodforthought for giving a contrary opinion. nice."
starterpack,I have a right to live with you?
WTF,"i made this face

D: 

in real life"
bon_appetit,"i believe you mean pinch hitter.

also I would say she's more of a utility player :)"
survivor,"this may all be true, but the point which you seem to be missing is that looking at a small sample size of results is NOT indicative of any gender bias. This is to not say there ISN""T gender bias, only that a small sample size of results is not evidence for it. For the same reason that a small sample size of coinflips could SUGGEST bias when there isn't any. This is the problem with extrapolating conclusions from a small sample size in a game with a large amount of variance. The results that we have aren't really conclusive of anything. There could be gender bias, or there could not be and the results we see are just short term variance."
survivor,"please take the time to actually understand what I am saying, rather than present ridiculous strawman arguments"
survivor,"hey man, thanks for taking over this debate. I could only do so much on my own before losing patience lol"
brexit,"Yeah we all eat bleach meat in the usa. That’s totally a thing and not some bizarre thing you brits just made up. Also, pretty rich having brits criticize American cuisine."
CoronavirusMa,We were in lockdown to flatten the curve and not overwhelm our hospitals. We have done that. This was never about not getting corona initially. The narrative on that has shifted
survivor,"I did not say ""stats"" are meaningless, ""stats"" are quite significant, that is why I said we should be mindful of short term variance and how that could (and does) distort perceptions.

I said your conclusion based on the available information is meaningless. It's like flipping a coin 3 times and getting 2 heads and 1 tail and saying the coin is biased in favor of heads 66% of the time. that's what we are doing here."
PoliticalDiscussion,"conservatism seeks to preserve the status quo. Therefore, any compromise from the conservative side, is a loss. Any compromise from the liberal side, is an automatic win, no matter the margin. The philosophies are fundamentally incompatible."
survivor,"no, it really doesn't make any sense to do that because what is being presented as evidence would be considered not to be any evidence at all in a scientific context. The stats we see for such a small sample size are essentially meaningless and tell us virtually nothing."
PoliticalDiscussion,"this is all due in part to the ever growing centralization of power  in our federal government, especially in the executive branch. The more concentrated power is, the more opportunity there is for corruption, and the higher the stakes every election is. It didn't used to be this way. If we had more de-centralization and smarter local state/country based politics, we wouldn't be in a situation where every election is a life or death contest."
survivor,"what I am saying is, people tend to underestimate the variance involved in small sample sizes. The game, as designed right now, could actually be totally fair and balanced for the genders, but short term variance is being deceptive. Note: I am not claiming their ISN'T gender bias, but I am saying people need to be aware of how deceptive short term variance can be and making inferences based on small sample sizes is a fools errand and not proof of much of anything."
survivor,"if you flip a coin, it's totally possible to get a distribution of 8-17. it's even likely over a decent sample size. there haven't been that many seasons of survivor. this could all be short term variance and we are due for a regression to the mean."
survivor,"in most circumstances I would agree with you, but when you literally do not actually play the game, it's an entirely different story. Nat did not play the game. she wasn't forming alliances. she wasn't competing in immunity challenges. she wasn't voting off people that would then have to turn around and vote for her. At every step of the way, her time on survivor was a completely different experience, and a completely different game entirely from what survivor actually is. your analogy doesn't hold up, because it's as if 3 people are playing monopoly, one goes bankrupt so goes off to play checkers for a couple of weeks, then rejoins the game later after everyone has has bought up all the property.

Voting BECAUSE x is your friend is not ""winning the game because you played the best"" The person voting for you is literally saying they are voting for you for non game reasons. 

This also ignores the fact that sometimes the best team in sports wont win. There is this thing called variance, perhaps you should look it up."
survivor,"I enjoyed the season overall, in spite of EOE."
survivor,"a lot of jurors absolutely vote for the person that played the best game, in fact I would say a super majority have done so historically. they may have different ideas of what the best game might mean, but ""i voted because she is my friend"" isn't one of those reasons typically.

> How good or bad of a game you played is defined by whether or not the jury voted for you.

no it isn't. only mouthbreather fans think this."
survivor,"it's not a game?

or you don't for who played the best game? in that case what's the point of all the questions at the end from the jury if you are just voting for your friend?

we sure waste a lot of time at the end with the jury asking questions about game playing and jeff probst saying ""survivor is about outwith outlast and outplay"" in that case.

no one is saying it's illegal to vote for a friend. No one is going to survivor jail over it, but there is this thing called sportsmanship. It's a game they are playing, you should be voting for who played the best. That's how it's been framed since the beginning."
survivor,"yeah.. so how does someone ""Getting played"" make you respect them?"
survivor,"makes me respect him less. You are there to compete. you get that far and you give up? To white knight sarah? Also what if sarah was going to vote him out anyway? Now instead of her making a move, she'll be have thought to have done it because she had ""permission."" It was a chump move on ben's part."
survivor,"i dont care if everyone knows. it's still a joke, it's against the spirit of the game. acting as if being voted out first is a valid strategy is laughable."
survivor,"if you are voted out first, it is a huge black mark against you. you basically didn't play the game. you didn't have alliances. you didn't win the immunity necklace, you didn't have to vote people out that will vote for you at the end, it's a total joke."
survivor,please qualify this statement?
survivor,"let me help you understand - most people hate EOE, and we don't care if it's ""part of this game"" - we consider it fundamentally against the spirit of survivor for someone that had their torch snuffed to be able to come back in. I would vote for a purple rock over an eoe'r"
survivor,"as someone that can sometimes be salty about michelle, yes she absolutely deserved 2nd place."
survivor,"michelle has had zero control of this game so far and the only reason she hasn't been voted out is because other more skilled and threatening players have been taken out first. michelle is not a very good player, and that's all there is to it"
Medici_Netflix,"that's really odd, because it was in english for me.."

buy advantages for competitions

you can do all of this without EoE"
survivor,i hate it. I think it's wrong on so many levels that someone that may not have even interacted with another player still gets to have a vote on whether such a person wins. I think it's an abomination that people voted out of the game can give disadvantages to people still playing. EoE just plain sucks
survivor,if you want more screen time with our fav players we could just have ponderosa footage on the actual show rather than youtube

CoronavirusMa,"Do you have to justify the freedom of the press, or your right to practice religion?  The right to bear arms is enshrined in our constitution, it is recognized as a natural right - that is to say, it's not a privilege granted to us by our government, but it is instead a right acknowledged by our government to be pre-existing and inherent to all men and women. For these reasons, asking one to *justify* why they need a gun is against our constitutional principles.

I don't have to justify why I need to eat food, or breathe air. Owning a gun is every bit as fundamental and important, and needs zero justification."
