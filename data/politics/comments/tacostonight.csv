FIFA,"I've been playing two weeks. My best tradeable pull is an 8500 coin bronze. I wanted to play non PL this year, but the only good players i've pulled have been untradeable and PL (kdb, wij, vardy). 

I have gotten 84 jimenez 5 times this week alone as an untradeable dupe.

i started in div 8, got to division 5 casually and honestly feel like i am playing legendary ai with how everyone does the same thing every game. sit back, counter....all fucking game. 

I am expecting a shitty pl freeze today, and nothing from the challenge much like the 5x85's and 2 ultimate packs i got after doing those one league sweatfests.

but , i'll log in today, use my beckham and feel good pounding some bangers today.

edit:

man u sbc is of course something i can fucking afford to do. gg."
FIFA,"martial feels like he is the only player to resemble how they play in real life. Lazy, is really the only word i can describe, he just disappears on the pitch. I like son, but honestly my little goal popper has been jesus."
eagles,"If there’s one thing I’ll always remember about the post Super Bowl seasons it’s, 17 points. It just feels like we scored 17 in half our games the past 3 years. I know it’s the case but it’s the first thing I saw on the screen cap of this."
FIFA,"i needed one shot like you. I went into a game, scored to quick own goals and let the guy score a couple more. after seeing what i was doing, he brought his keeper out to let me bang some finesse shots outside the box in. From there, we just ran back and forth trying crosses."
FIFA,"i don't play competitively but am enjoying it because of that reason. I play some rivals to get rewards but live in the friendlies with objectives. I've gotten a ton of free packs, i don't spend money, and probably play at most 7 to8 hours a week if i am lucky. 

When i do play rivals though, the game isn't as enjoyable. 99% of teams i face do nothing but sit back with what feels like the entire stadium of fans in their box and then spam counter attacks. the friendlies are awesome because for the most part people are kinda kept in check with teams. 

for 20$ or whatever, if you get a few weeeks of enjoyment out of it, totally worth it."
FIFA,wish i'd done this one instead of the 2x ultimate and 5x 85. Got shit from them.
FIFA,"you can build the team, go to squad battles and keep playing the top team. start game, pause, quit, restart, and it'll give you a game played for loyalty. You get losses on your record , but it is the fastest way i know."
FIFA,"look up the completed challenges on futbin.

eagles,"Great post, i don't agree on 7 but it's a personal opinion. I am sick of watching the guy every year and am done with him. I don't think he'll ever be a franchise guy. It's always something, whether valid or not, it's like the employee that has an issue with health, mental, personal, co-workers. I just don't get defending a guy that can't hit a 2 yard pass , since he was in the league. The refreshing thing with hurts was how he could hit those little quick LOS passes to guys in stride. 

There is always an excuse, but when you pay someone to be the best on your team and they aren't, regardless of reasons, he's not worth it and won't ever be. This makes howie, doug, and anyone else that had a say in giving him the money look like morons. Hurts coming in and getting it done, while not even looking great (just not as bad as wentz) shows the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing as far back as the draft. 

I am done with the defense as well. No linebackers and whatever this CB play is for the past decade is just old. Schwartz calls the absolute worst blitz packages i've ever seen. If brees was playing last night, we'd had lost 24-49. 

i am happy they came out to play but the woes of 17 points rang true almost the entire second half. The last scoring drive we had woke me up a bit but there are gaps of playtime with this team where they just disappear for chunks of games. It's been that way since 2018.

Dough didn't even look like he was happy about winning against a good football team. 1 win against a winning team isn't getting me on a , ""things have changed!"" bandwagon yet."
eagles,Was wondering when this stat would show itself
eagles,"Well fuck, I tried to be negative  and hate on the team but I can’t. They broke 17 points and won."
FIFA,"Gold 3 , rare gold pack, nothing ."
eagles,"God I thought I’d get enjoyable football again. Fuck this team. This is just fucking ridiculous At this point. 

Fire everyone."
eagles,I’d fire Schwartz right now
eagles,The Philadelphia 17’s
eagles,"Predictable. Listen, wentz is bad which has been displayed by hurts making the simple throws he can’t ,but another game stuck on 17. Doug needs to go."
eagles,I hate to be a complainer but this game is being kept close by the refs.
eagles,"They’re fun to watch again! 

Entertainment is back on the menu boys."
FIFA,A little piece of me dies every time I do these and get nothing .
FIFA,I’m thinking of going back to that or the 4222. I was enjoying the 352 off meta to start because it was new and refreshing. Now that I’m settled in it feels like to much micromanaging and I am not great at seeing a wide field or stopping the nonstop counter attacks.
FIFA,"In in five 6 now, was 5 almost 4 , but started in 7.

I come across people that are just better than me all the time. In friendlies, in rival, in weekend league. I just haven’t seen it enough to assume everyone is farming me."
FIFA,Can’t remember if it was 18 or 19 but I used Jesus for the whole year.
FIFA,"0 . Bought the game Sunday after Black Friday for 20 bucks. My goal was to give them as little money as possible.

My best tradeable pull was a bronze I sold for 8500. I’ve made about 170k so far playing and bpm. I have a team that’s worth about 200k in untradeables."
FIFA,"It really is and it won’t change because no matter what, the addicts buy the packs up in a minute when they’re released. When people keep paying for garbage , why would ea change it?"
FIFA,van aanholt stayed in my team the entire year i played.
FIFA,I’m so bad at this game and I’ve been trying to figure it out . I just press them at different times and sometimes cool shit  happens but most the time I just walk into the defender. I’m waiting for an explanation.
eagles,"the best thing that can happen for the eagles organization is the oline or something they can blame his bad play on if he plays bad. 

The worst thing that can happen is him being either good or bad.

For fans, realize the organization is a mess right now and just hope we have an exciting and fun game. I remember 2018, and it made me throw up in my mouth. Not because we lost, because that was one of those games forever etched in my memory of a team that had no intention of winning at the start of the game."
FIFA,"leno - sommer - burki - 2 hadreckis 

lol."
eagles,Great job on summarizing this. I am in my 40s and you really put together those years exactly how I felt them.
eagles,"Because if hurts plays well, our front office and coaching staff look like absolute morons. 

Wentz should have been benched several weeks ago. He’s only getting benched now because pressure. 

If hurts is bad they look like idiots wasting a pick on him. 

I still remember draft night and the mental gymnastics people were going through here to justify the pick. It was a bad pick then and now it’s a lose lose situation.

The ideal results for the organization is that he plays like a serviceable backup but even average play is miles above wentz’ play this year. 

They fucked up. The head coach looks like he is going to melt down every press conference. The owner is in fuck watching the games mode and howie looks like someone who writes checks based on his mouth and not his wallet.

No matter how hurts plays the organization is an absolute shit show right now."
FIFA,"i am getting beat mostly on counter attacks, so my coins are going to backs with wheels first. I've found i score the same amount of goals no matter who is up front, and my cm's don't vary whether it's fred for 1k or wijnaldum for 30k."
FIFA,i find tuesday and wednesday to be utter shit for it. thursday thru monday to be okay.
FIFA,"as a late starter this year, and a zero fp buyer i really am enjoying the game. I have gotten fuck all in my pulls but i love managerial masterpiece, the silver objectives, and honestly enough stuff that i have no desire to play weekend league. I have my frustrations with some aspects but being able to play the game with so many different lineups has been nice. 

The great thing about friendlies, is there's no punishment. if someone is making the game unfun, i just leave. My stress levels and fun factor this year are much higher than any year, and i may possibly stay longer than my usual 2-3 months."
FIFA,maybe better to sub him in when i am down and use as my relief since my mids get gassed around 60-70min in?
FIFA,"I started about ten days ago , I did the placements in a bronze squad which plopped me in division 7. When I got to six I ran into some good players and some bad. When I got to 5 , I ran into every person who watched a YouTube personality and just spammed the same thing over and over. 

High press, counter attack over and over with wonderful drop back tactics on top of it.
Monce I figured out how to beat that and move up in div 5 I started playing some people that just shredded me with skill and I played people that were so bad I thought they were bots.

I really don’t think I should be div 4 and I’m fine with that. I haven’t encountered a ton of super elite players in 5. It’s a mosh of extremes , either really good or really bad and there’s few and far in between close games."
FIFA,"It happens so much, I don’t even wtf rage. I just sigh."
nfl,"anyone questioning this during the time was crucified. He was mediocre at best his first year, had an mvp year, was mediocre at best the following year, and mediocre at best last year. The problems he's having now were concerns then, he has had injury problems, and the franchise is a disaster. Anytime you brought it up with eagle's fans you were told to stop being a fan. 

but, if you told me we'd pay a qb to be bad for all but one year and win a superbowl i'd had taken it then, and do now. We are going to be bad for a long while now, the writing is on the wall. 

He wasn't worth the money then, and instead of paying someone 10 mil to be average and having money to build up a solid defense and supporting cast, we have wentz and alshon followed by a crapton of crap."
FIFA,"i typicall last around 2 months. Once teams become uninteresting and everyone is stocked up with the same squads and super players. Since i started late, i feel like i walked into that already. I'd say this year, probably mid january i'll call it quits."
FIFA,"i've gotten , ibra untradeable 4 times. Been playing less than ten days."
FIFA,"To answer the question, no. I have not done a player sbc and probably won't for the forseeable future for the reasons below.

this year i bought the game on black friday for 20$. I decided to just play, collect whatever the game gives me and if i can do an sbc i'll do an sbc. I wanted to do allesandrini but couldn't. Since I am not dropping another penny on the game, and starting late, if i do an sbc it'll need to be someone who i will use long term. Son is one of my favorite players in PL but there is absolutely no way i could even think of doing him. I can't even do 1 of the sbc's in his challenge.

My best pull has been untradeable kdb, untradeable martial. My best tradeable pull was some bronze player that sold for 7500 coins. I finished all the foundation sbc's and got pjanic and saul as the best pulls. 

I am 9 days in with about 120k coins, and a squad worth about whatever kdb+martial are worth plus a bunch of random golds for 20k. 

The way it's going, I may get to do one futmas sbc if i am lucky. It may sound like a real downer but it's not. I am enjoying the managerial masterpiece and rivals. Playing with a non-meta squad and getting free players has made the game enjoyable. 

my only regret is that i use talisca in my starting squad and love him, i missed his sbc."
FIFA,"the best is when you get into the box and see a wide open striker in front of goal a few meters away, you aim to pass, but eject it back to midfield."
FIFA,my best tradeable pulls this year have been from bpm :\
eagles,thanks for the different view and you may be right. Part of it is that i was watching rodgers toss balls with little effort last night also.
eagles,"""opinion"". It may have been the beer, but his arm looked really weak."
eagles,"I am probably one of the most anti-wentz people here. That said, hurts coming in only showed me a few things.

The oline is in fact awful at pass protection. Now, a lot of sacks are on wentz but hurts being in there showed just how bad the pocket is for our qb's. 

alshon ran a shitty route, fulgham dropped a pass. Seriously, alshon is done. Again, wentz has been wildly inaccurate and not good but seeing some of the plays reinforces that our wr's are not playing well. Hurts being in did show how bad wentz is at throwing players open but seeing the way alshon was running out there and the drop, it also shows some of this is not on wentz.

playcalling , it is that bad. Regardless of who's playing qb. 

raegor is good and will get better with hurts in. 

unpopular opinion, hurts is not a starting qb but wentz is THAT bad.  You have to go with hurts though, see what you can achieve with his ceiling. 

Some non-qb related stuff. Wtf is the deal with sanders? he's the best player we have on offense and we go out and grab howard who was cut last week. Sanders is looking good every single game and still is not a featured back..

I am over the cornerback philosophy of never turning around. over a decade of this tactic. they even highlighted this shit during the game last night on the lack of int's. 





it may be me, but i am not sure that hurts will have the nfl arm as teams adjust to him if he continues to start."
nfl,Seeing hurts play really amplifies how awful the line is at pass protecting
nfl,"So, after seeing hurts play :

1. Wentz is bad.

2. The play calling is bad

3. The oline is bad

Takeaway, some of the woes are not on wentz but some are. I don’t think it matters who starts , the team is awful, but from the small sample hurts as a rookie with hardly any playtime looks better."
nfl,Won’t even be mad if we lose. I’m just enjoying us playing like we want to win for the first in 2 months.
nfl,"Not just the fact this guy seems worlds more accurate than wentz so far, but wentz would have taken at least three more sacks on that drive"
nfl,Wentz looking for manut bol to throw to
nfl,"At some point , would you pull the trigger on benching wentz just to save the dude setting records for being the worst qb in the history of professional football? Like, I’m benching you so you stop hurting yourself type thing."
nfl,This team plays like a group of people that all don’t like each other in the workplace .
nfl,"Even if he didn’t slip, why the fuck even throw that"
nfl,Rodgers 4 years 134 mil. Wentz 4 years 128 mil.
nfl,"We have a back averaging 5 ypc, we bring in a back who was cut to replace him. Why? 

Wentz is still starting. Why?"
nfl,Rodgers tosses those passes so effortlessly. Wentz seems like he’s mustering every ounce of strength to toss it half a yard accurately. Don’t know how you can see these two qbs play and think wentz is worth the amount of money comparable to what Rodgers makes. It’s night and day just watching how they see the field.
eagles,Wentz costing points. He coulda taken three knees there and it’d been better.
eagles,Ward wide open there on third.
eagles,"Hey run works , better throw. Another week in Doug’s offense. Fuck this team."
nfl,I’m a closet Miami fan this year. Love the way they are a family out there.
FIFA,"I tend to get more worried when someone has an 81 rated team when I’m pushing gold 3,2,1.

The elite teams motivate me, the 70chem, weird teams scare me."
eagles,"Conversation and accountability is a few weeks late. Having this meeting this late in the season really only shows the lack of accountability. 

Any success the team has now only serves to hurt our draft pick next year. It’s a sad fact , we have money problems, on top of winning problems. We desperately need to draft well next year and winning hurts that."
FIFA,"I am casual, maybe an hour a day at most if i can even get that. I don't buy packs, and wait till black friday to purchase the base game. One thing i've learned from starting hardcore in 2016  to being where I am now in the game, is to really only get players i plan on using long term. 

futmas is hard because i love the designs, and there are usually several players i want. You just have to pick and choose if you don't buy fifa points and play at a healthy level of time invested. It stinks that i'll never get those son potm's, or aguero's , and my best sbc is usually towards the end of the year but that's how the game is made. 

i play rivals and squad battles, not being able to really get enough time in to go high up on either of those. i collect my rewards, and just keep collecting. Some years i get lucky, some years i don't , but i just take what the game gives me."
SeriousFIFA,"I started playing with the 352 and saw incredible results. Taking me from div 7 to 4. 

current team - https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/3733931

i packed kdb and wijnaldum today and was wondering if someone who plays the formation can point me in the right direction to finish it up. I have only been playing a week, so my budget is only around 100k.

thanks."
FIFA,"playing 352 and really loving it. Current squad:

https://www.futbin.com/21/squad/3733931

i just pulled untradeable de bruyne and wijnaldum . Have 100k to spend as well. Any suggestions?"
eagles,anyone that can summarize after the pay wall portion?
FIFA,"yup, i don't think people realize it's free coins for minimal effort. i always appreciate seeing these posts."
FIFA,"everything outside writing the down the dupes for me. I am even more casual. I fill up my transfer list, i'll relist a couple times and then send all to club after 3 times relisting. typically this has me opening 5-7 packs every hour and keeps a steady stream of coin coming in. I average about 10k a day bpm'ing and i don't check it every hour. i relist before work, at lunch, when i get home, and when i go to bed, refilling as necessary. On the weekends, i'll upgrade bronzes to silvers if i feel like it. I don't plan to play fut champs this year (i didn't actually purchase fifa until black friday to avoid the urge to buy packs). 

But yah, bpm is tried and true and keeps money coming in when you don't buy fifa points and don't play the market."
FIFA,"hey /u/wahoos22, 

just wanted to update and thank you on the recommendations for the squad. I bought the game on black friday and tried pounding out the normal 4231 which i just don't enjoy. Your recommended squad using my only good pull (martial) has worked wonders.

I placed in div 7 rivals before switching. I've not lost once in rivals since switching to the 352 climbing up into the 5 range now , i've only lost 1 game and had a several ties, but everything else has been wins. 

I am using the standard to just get familiar until i start messing around with tactics but it's working like a charm.

I think this is going to be the formation i stick with long term because it uses another fun formation as a backup the (4222). 

Right now, i feel tolisca and anderson are really holding me back on the attack. Felipe because his gold isn't too great at cam, and him as a striker is hard cause he has no physicality or hold up play. 

if you aren't busy, was wondering if you could give me some ideas on players to move forward to. My pack luck is shite, and only have around 100k to spend but would like some long term goals.

Edit: packed kdb and wijnaldum untradeable."
eagles,"You have to fuck up real bad for us fans to call for your head 3 years after our first super bowl win and howie, Doug and co. are some how doing it.

There’s only 4 pro bowlers on that roster . Foles and wentz aren’t really elite players that were legendary picks.

So, that makes it look even worse. 

The last explosive wideout we have drafted was Jackson. I’m in 40s and think Lito/Reggie were the last decent cb we drafted. 

Shady the last but sanders is the real deal.

Barnett looks like a meh pick. Linebackers? Fuck, I haven’t seen any remarkable ones here since Seth Joyner days. 

I’ll take the Super Bowl win, but historically we haven’t really drafted hall of fame talent in a couple decades."
nfl,"Because he was almost this bad for most of last year. We won the division by beating the nfceast with the last 4 games.

The year before , he was playing mediocre at best. Foles came in and lit up Houston , and the Vikings gave us a wildcard.

His rookie year, he had one or two good games early and then looked a little below average at best.

2017 , he had a good year statistically and that’s the exception.

Wentz from the past two years and his rookie year were not good. 5 years and 1 good season do not make this an anomaly, it makes 2017 the anomaly.

People saying he played good last year or even the year before are remembering a couple games and not the entire season."
FIFA,"decided to buy the game during black friday, sucks that i was unable and still am unable to enjoy any of the content or players released. I made around 70k in a couple days by doing my qualifiers for rivals with martial and 10 bronzes (actually won 1 and tied 2, was shocked). The coin boosts helped a bit to build me a solid starting team. 

My goal was to wait, so i didn't build myself up thinking i needed to participate in black friday. It offers no sales outside the base game. I've done a few of the foundation sbc's, and opened about 15 packs that were handed out, my best player being martial untradeable with like my very first pack. 

i honestly can't believe people toss their hard earned money at this shit. It's fun and i enjoy the game but they'll never see a penny from me outside paying for the base game.

reading the posts though, i don't think us non-spenders affected the game's sales though. reading the packs still sold out in just a few minutes."
eagles,"Yah, why the fuck does he keep putting wentz back in."
FIFA,"I don’t treat it as something I have to do, instead I treat it as entertainment. Something that gives me some fun at the end of a long work day.

I logged in tonight and wasn’t feeling it , played two matches and punched out.

I don’t buy fp, I don’t stress over sbcs. I will probably get one great player at the rate I make coins and that’s fine. 

I typically play the game about two months out of the year. I hit a point where the cash grabs are just overwhelming.

In one sense I agree because of the content. The chances of pulling a promo or totw vs drop rates is absurd. It’s just too many players with unneeded upgrades.

I feel like the game tries to over complicate itself and lacks consistency on mechanics. It’s trying to put in realistic stuff while the base mechanics are unrealistic (pace, positions, chemistry, etc..)

I honestly preferred the finesse long shots and ping pong , arcade style over the past two/three years."
nfl,"Wentz is reaching Ryan leaf levels. Lurie has to be making the call on keeping wentz in. There was absolutely no reason to keep him in the past two weeks. 

He’s actually getting worse. I’m at a total loss trying to figure out why the dude is still on the field."
nfl,"Wentz is waiting on receivers to be backyard football open. I’ve been really trying to just look at why he’s not throwing and he just doesn’t see the field or believe his receivers will get open. 

I honestly believe he has no faith in throwing. There are hardly any coverage throws or contested throws. Missing easy slants, off target with a guy three yards out.

Seattle has a historically bad defense this year and that drive was the best we could muster. 

Unfortunately, that drive keeps wentz in."
nfl,"Gonna watch a hallmark movie with my wife , rather be just bored than bored and upset."
nfl,"In all seriousness, I’ve been watching football over 40 years and have never seen a an this bad week in week out not get yanked. They aren’t just bad, they’re not even trying. It’s like they are trying to make themselves unwatchable."
nfl,"1/6 on passes wentz, jfc is hurts that bad? Is sudfeld that bad? Wentz is the worst qb in football. Running it three times in a row is better than this. 

Fuck, enough is fucking enough with wentz."
nfl,Come on guys let’s get three yards at least on this drive.
nfl,Defense gets a 4th down a goal stop and we get two yards as a thank you. Defense gonna be gassed by half time and eagles fans will call for Schwartz head.
nfl,Announcers really amplifying just how bad the eagles are on offense. “3 and out for the eagles and Seattle didn’t even need to make a tackle!”
FIFA,"thanks man, i am from pompano."
FIFA,"if you are still around /u/wahoos22 , was hoping maybe you could give me a good starter team. Picked up the game on black friday, i am just looking for a fun formation. i have no intention of sweating real hard this year and my very first formation back in 16 was the 352. Anyways, i don't have much.

I pulled martial in my beginner pack untradeable (willing to use him as a sub if he's not ideal on this formation). 

I have 75k to spend. also have talisca, felipe anderson, and allan untradeable. 

cheers.

watched a streamable of yours by the way. 305 ?"
FIFA,"The games own currency isn’t worth using on packs and people think throwing real money at them is better value. 

I got the game at Target yesterday for 20$ (29.99 and I had a 10$ coupon). I’ll deep around for a month or two and move on. It’s fun for a couple months each year. 

I use what I pull and just save my earning for players. I never get the meta players but I build fun teams and play casually. I’ll do a weekend league once or twice and play drafts, rivals casually.

I don’t even pay attention to the events. When you treat the game as a source of entertainment and stop pretending you will be on the main stage competing but the best players are the only thing holding you back, the game is a different experience. 

I just feel bad for all the people that will wake up one day in their mid 40s like me and realize just how all that expendable income really wasn’t expendable (there’s no such thing)."
FIFA,Ea access is included in game pass now. Do the old fifas have active rivals and weekend league? I just want play casually and mess around and was wondering if there is any value in the older versions? How active are they in terms of market and population?
FIFA,"this is me. everytime i think about buying it, i come here and this sub saves me from paying for it. I'll wait till it's on ea access and play it for 4.99 for a month."
eagles,who?
eagles,didn't chubb  delete him with a stiff arm this weekend?
eagles,"The coaching staff doesn't feel that hurts is better than the worst qb in the league right now. That alone, should quiet people hoping he plays."
eagles,"there was a time, actually many of times through my 40+ years of life that i said to myself...i don't care if the eagles suck forever after, just give me a superbowl. If you give me what the rams have been and are, vs the eagles , i'll take the superbowl win any day of the week. if mcvay and goff were winning superbowls left and right, then yah.  whatever the reason we won it all, be it  reich, stars aligning, we won with wentz for most of the season and pederson as coach. 

That said, wentz is not good and pederson is a bum, and if they both left tomorrow i'd be okay with it."
nfl,"old news, we been hearing this for 11 weeks now."
eagles,maddox at a 39.3 ...jfc is he that bad?
eagles,"you don't pay a guy this kind of money to be coached on how to throw check down passes. every week, the breakdown shows he is not good. Good coaching could help him not suck as much i guess, but it doesn't fix the fact we threw the house at a guy that cannot perform at a level that matches his money."
Genshin_Impact,thank you.
Genshin_Impact,good stuff thank you.
Genshin_Impact,"someone build me 3 teams. open world, abyss 1, abyss 2, and suggest 2 dps for me please? I am ar45 and struggling a bit, so trying to mix it up. My lineup excluding the freebie ones:

c6 fischl, c6 barbara, c3 ning, c1 jean, c4 diona, c6 xiang,  c4 xingq, c3 noelle, c1 sucrose

no constellations. beidou, chong . venti, klee."
eagles,"this is just a go through the motions thing. if the team was good and just rusty or it was just injuries, we'd had made some progress. so far, the team is regressing as we get healthier and as the season goes on. They're just going to go out there, run the same plays , call the same game, and punch out when the game is over. Doug has no answers which is clear by his answers."
nfl,"what's that say about hurts though? Wentz is the worst qb in football this year, no questions asked, and our coaching staff thinks hurts is worse than that."
eagles,I don't even think the big thing here is him taking a sack when he coulda thrown the ball away. It's that it looks like he didn't even know what the play was from start to finish. You aren't seeing that he rolled out to the side of the field with zero receivers on it and did the fake handoff to the side with no running back.
nfl,"they threw the house at wentz to draft him. they threw the house at him to keep him and it turns out his one good year was also the year foles looked liked a hall of famer (after 2 bad games , foles lit up the world). The eagles organization is on the verge of total collapse and they're going to have money issues going forward with or without wentz. They're uninspired, bland, and just not a fun team to watch. Drafting hurts in the second, and then watching the coach say benching wentz says the wrong message that the season is over should be all anyone needs to see. Doug essentially just told his rookie, that starting him would mean the season is over (wtf says that as a leader?) . The eagles could have nabbed winston, or any of a dozen backups they'd never put in. Instead they blew a second round pick and suffered with horrible o-line play, linebackers that get sent to another galaxy by stiffarms, no replacement at safety, 1 good cb, etc.. They are in bad shape, the coach is in denial, the qb has had 1 good season and 4 mediocre/ bad seasons while taking enough money to probably purchase north dakota. 

The only thing good out of this season, is it's shutting up a ton of eagle's fans who , in all honestly, are worse than this team. They come out of the woodwork with their weird statistics, excuses, and overall insults like we are supposed to just love a shitty team even when they're shitty as some sort of way of life or we aren't true fans. I have no issue turning this team off and watching exciting football, it doesn't make me less of a fan, it just means i don't want to watch a shitty qb play like shit week in and week out."
eagles,"So you feel that the worst qb in the league is better than the 2nd round qb you blew a pick on? Basically saying you can’t draft or win, got it , thanks."
nfl,"this is such a good point. we drafted raegor which was a questionable draft in the first, and then we take a qb in the 2nd. Why take that pick if you aren't going to use the player when the person in front is playing this bad? it makes the draft pick look even worse."
eagles,"jfc it was a bad throw.

i've seen , ""well wentz got married"", ""well wentz got married and had a kid"", ""doug wrote a book"", you name it. HE IS FUCKING AWFUL. no matter who you blame will not change the fact he's bad at qb."
eagles,"this is a team going through the motions to just get through the year at this point. There's no passion or drive. Doug is sticking with wentz, schwartz is sticking with with what he's doing. I wouldn't expect any big time changes because they are going out there and playing solely because they're getting paid to and that's it. 

we're stuck with wentz and doug until lurie decides enough is enough. Putting hurts in will only energize the fans, it doesn't solve the fact we paid wentz 100mil + to be bad on the normal and  average on a good day.

organization is in a bad place. drafting sucks, playcalling sucks, contracts suck."
eagles,"he was average at best the year before that also, he had a 4 or 5 game stretch down the line last year with no talent that made people a believer but his overall play the past 5 years combined is below average. anything thinking he is better than average is living in a fantasy."
eagles,team can't draft. you think they can rebuild?
nfl,still can't get over the guy telling me doug writing a book is the reason wentz and the eagles suck.
nfl,"it's just eagles fans trying to make themselves feel better saying ""wow you didn't blow us out, you mustn't be that good, LOL!"" fact is, you guys played good football and are 7-3 and have an amazing fucking running game and defense. gg, my dude."
nfl,"why? the score doesn't reflect how much the browns dominated this game. a td with 1 minute left isn't something to say this was somehow close. the browns played good, real good."
nfl,"of course, alshon should know to jump 15 feet in the air to catch it."
nfl,"there's absolutely no way, he doesn't get benched for next week. how do you even justify keeping him in after that throw?"
nfl,worst throw of the year.
nfl,"oh god, more wentz. yay."
nfl,"hopefully we get to see a hurts drive after this, game is over and i don't think it does any damage at this point. wentz has taken a beating, and offense isn't really putting anything out that is productive."
nfl,"wentz launching it into triple coverage....and for the best excuse today, must be because doug wrote a book after winning the superbowl."
nfl,is that your reasoning as to why we suck? doug writing a book?
nfl,throwing an incomplete pass in teh direction of a receiver. he had dg he could have just overthrown.
nfl,"take this fucking guy out of the game for fuck sakes. throw it away, or to the open TE that you didnt see, anything but giving up points. Wentz is repsonsible for 9 of cleveland's twelve points......seriously, wtf bench this guy."
nfl,how in god's name is wentz still playing?
nfl,how can you expect wentz to be good with all the political turmoil going on? i know....forgot about that. he's forgiven.
nfl,"this is just an off year for wentz. We got it next year. hard for a guy to succeed with unfair weather conditions, less than 20 seconds in the pocket , and he doesn't have 5 jerry rice's . next year he'll be better."
nfl,corned beef
nfl,wentz finally checks down...on 3rd and 20.
nfl,how did we even win 3 games? jfc...
nfl,quicksand
nfl,"just like every other week, the announcers are showing wr's open and wentz not seeing them. i just don't get how this guy is still starting at this point."
nfl,who to blame now wentz homers? the weather?
nfl,beautiful cleveland weather today.
nfl,"gl brownies . I have no rage left in me, so i am just hoping for an entertaining game and not the boredom i've experienced all year from philly."
Genshin_Impact,"No, but I am older and a home owner, with a family...when i see people here and in games like FIFA say they have ""disposable income"" on virtual goods i get a little sad inside. There's no such thing as Disposable income for 99% of the world. Gambling on goods that don't exist blows my mind. It's one thing to buy a game for entertainment and what not, but to keep throwing out your money so you can do the games chores better, just doesn't make sense to me. If i had an extra 1k i'd buy a new lawnmower."
Genshin_Impact,"if by worst is she the best dps? nope. the best healer? nope.

But, she can do both of those roles good enough that she is probably one of the best characters to have on your team for all content. She's not exciting to play imo but she's a staple in my groups just because of utility."
nfl,"it doesn't matter who starts. they can't evaluate talent anyways, wentz had one good year and the rest has been average, hovering at below average with wow moments sprinkled in from time to time. we have an organizational problem from scouting (fulgham being the exception and not the rule), to drafting, training staff, coaching, contracts, and so forth and so on. One player doesn't fix problems when you have a coach who , had he not gone for 2 so many times or kicked field goals instead of going for it on 4th from the 30, we may be looking at a different record this year. 

This team is actually just boring to watch and putting hurts in will only generate some temporary excitement. He does deserve a chance to start , anyone else in this league would be benched by now but they threw the bank at wentz and he's the face of the franchise, so if it hasn't happened yet, i don't see it happening."
eagles,"S & S the only things i've been excited about this season , with some fulgham sprinkled in for a few weeks."
eagles,"Give me the difference in what we paid for wentz over keeping foles any day of the week. Foles being worse doesn’t matter much when you factor in we paid a qb elite money to be at the bottom of the list. 

He wasn’t worth the money to begin with and now we are in cap hell with old uninterested players, bad coaches, and a shitty franchise qb.

We are entering a rough time period and it’s gonna be a while before the ship rights itself."
nfl,"How has tua looked winced starting, overall?"
eagles,"according to this sub, not throwing two picks, fumbling two times, and not costing us the game makes wentz elite/good. having a slightly below average game by another qb , i guess means wentz somehow played well."
nfl,"going for 2 down 4, just highlights the absolute disaster this team is. wentz is getting paid top 10 money but probably wouldn't start on a top ten team, guy is lucky if he's considered a top 25 qb by end of year. I know, i know, o-line, doug play calling, injuries to wr's, bla bla. He's not a good qb, and the eagles  threw a shit ton of money at a guy who's one good year is the exception. W/e , gg giants, the better team won today."
nfl,"jones threw some nice passes today. if you watched the whole game, the giants just played a straight up better football game all day. our defense had really no answer to the gameplan."
eagles,the defense gave us 3 chances to tie it. how come wentz gets a pass every week?
eagles,dough isn't throwing 15 foot high passes to 5 foot running backs. can you take your lips of went'z knob and realize the guy's one good year is the exception and not the rule.
eagles,"fucking defense actually turns it up to hold them to 2 field goals and wentz turds it up again. This fucking guy had 1 good year and people think he has some sort ""it"" factor. He's a bum."
eagles,gg giants
eagles,that's why wentz is not the answer.
eagles,"defense held tight 3 drives only allowing 3. Let's see if wentz and doug cannot go full moron here and actually put a drive together. im ready for a 2nd and 10 hurts play for no yards , change my mind doug."
eagles,"that's the , we give up, handoff."
eagles,can someone give me a serious answer on why we went for 2?
eagles,"since the chip kelly days, we keep having these corners that never turn their heads. Whoever our cb coach is, has to have been here with chip kelly."
eagles,"tell you right now, i am not watching another year of us sucking and just hoping the rest of the division and other teams suck worse   the last 3 weeks. if we lose this, i am punching out the rest of the year and ill watch the highlights. It's just not fun watching them, they're not just bad , they're boring af."
Genshin_Impact,"Do you want all the characters and feel like not getting them all for free is unfriendly? Then no.

Do you want to get 5 star weapons? If yes then , no.

Do you want to have access to upgrading more heroes at a quicker rate? If yes, then no.

You can play this game top to bottom with what it gives you. You may get lucky , you may not, on banners.

You have a solid few weeks of casual playtime to make the determination though. Nothing you would be doing the first few weeks has any real impact on anything outside of character development and you can find guides on using your resources wisely.

I put 60$ into the game at launch and haven’t dropped another dime, and don’t intend to."
Genshin_Impact,I keep getting blown away by the quality of the game. Ning looked like such a badass during the jade chamber fight.
Genshin_Impact,How would dionas shield work with beidou? Does it help accumulate absorb burst or does it ruin the beidou counter?
politics,"Vet here. Good, fuck him."
Genshin_Impact,"I did 30 pulls from what I had saved up. 

2 x ning 

1 x beidou

1x Fiona

Not great , not terrible. I really wanted beidou though and c1 ningg, so mission accomplished I guess."
Genshin_Impact,"I played beidou in the beta, she’s my favorite character . I don’t care if she’s top tier or not I love her design. Ning , because I want c1 her and use her as well. If I get the 5 star that’s nice but I’m rolling for the 4 star."
politics,Putin was congratulating himself in 2016.
Genshin_Impact,No way I’d buy the bp just for the weapons . The crafted ones are free and comparable .
Genshin_Impact,"worth it? no. necessary for end game? arguably , yes. 

It's basically just resources that take forever to grind, and that's it. I think they should give you 1 acquaint every 5 levels, and 1 intertwined every ten. Then it'd give you something outside of resources worthwhile. 

I am hoping we see some cosmetics in there, maybe some cool food recipes and some fun stuff. Right now, i feel like i have to get it but don't feel like it has any value outside of the materials that i am starving for."
Genshin_Impact,There’s a tree branch you can stand on and not get hit by anything. Sure it takes about 4 minutes to do with fischl charged shots but it makes the boss trivial for me.
politics,"on decision desk hq, philadelphia county hasn't even hit total numbers matching 2016, for what it's worth. I am expecting more since the state totals are more than 2016."
Conservative,"can only speak for florida. when you request a mail in ballot it's logged in your voter reg. So if you request one, and go vote in person they'll pull up your file and see that you've requested a mail in ballot. If you've already sent it back and they received it then you cannot vote. If you requested one and didn't not send it back in you can vote in person. 

If you send it back in and they hadn't received it, then go vote in person with those intentions it's a federal crime. The county you are in will reject one of them though."
politics,my wife voted for trump and also the 15$ dollar increase.
eagles,"i don't doubt his intelligence, but i doubt his processing power after the snap. there's been a few instances where the announcers have said, if he just put the ball where his receiver was going it'd been a touchdown. ANother instance of him doing a fake handoff to the wrong side and then a rollout to the wrong side all in one play. 

I don't think he has that reaction intelligence or processing power in his brain to really scan and react with speed. he's slow on putting the ball where it needs to go way to often.

short passes look like way to much work with him and it's way to many miracle prayer throws each game. He has a few bright moments but they're the exception and not the rule."
Genshin_Impact,"how did you get the resin to get the materials? If i had unlimited resin, i could see it as a posibility but it's looking like 2 weeks min to get a character 1-80 with the restrictions."
Genshin_Impact,"nothing is more deflating than hitting ar40 and realizing just how long it'll take you to get a character from 1-80. it's so bad, it's made me debate putting the time into the game."
Genshin_Impact,"if we're talking pick 6 numbers in the lottery and win millions. you have  a better chance of getting struck by lightening , twice.

if we're talking about scratchoff tickets , probably scratch off tickets.

otherwise, casino. 

Lastly, gacha. i don't see value in spending money on something that is not permanent. If i leave the game out of boredom, i spent money on something i don't even care about anymore. I just don't value temporary money. FIFA really opened my eyes to this."
Genshin_Impact,"im 40+ and still exploring liyue and opening chests. I have to decided what i want to do when i log in. I get maybe 2 hours of gameplay in a sitting and between the dailies, weeklies, events, and resources for characters i am not running out of things. Most of my time is revolved around upgrading characters but isn't that the ultimate goal anyways?

I realize people rushed through and have everything found but just giving an different perspective that some of us still don't have all the shrines for max stamina and are at ar40. i am on 9/10 of geo shrines with a huge chunk of area that isn't fully explored."
politics,"Honest answer: i do not know. My wife is highly intelligent, she is extremely moral, and an incredible woman. I never thought she'd hitch a ride on the q-anon train. 

You have to remember, once someone goes to a side their fears are being fed by predictions. After the news of the trump supporters surrounding the biden campaign bus, the first video she saw was of someone saying how democrats assassinated three trump supporters. When the fear is that believable, how can i predict the way she justifies anything. My wife legitimately believes the democrats are going to take away our freedom, and lock us in our houses until we rot. that's what she sees from the youtube personalities she watches."
politics,"My wife , is a trump supporter and she's actually been crying at points worried about what she believes will happen to the country should biden win. I've  just pretended to not care about it  to alleviate the stress she's going through and the anger she has when she asks me why I am not voting for trump. 

I've never seen anything like this in my 40+ years, and my biggest wish is that we can mend our divisive behavior towards one another sooner rather than later."
eagles,"outside of about 20 minutes of play, wentz has been pretty bad for a majority of the season. Sure it's a mixture of bad o-line play, receiver drops, game plan, but he's not helping himself with the turnovers and has kept bad teams in the game with mistakes solely on him. 

we are basically getting 2-3 good drives a game out of him, and the rest is just hard to watch at times. 

Press taylor isn't the one throwing the ball 6 feet above a 5 foot running back. he's also not the one holding the ball for 5 years, taking sacks and fumbling when he could throw it away. There was a play last night where wentz did a fake handoff in the wrong direction, rolled out to the side of the field with no receivers, and that's press' fault? The int's were just horrible decisions. Every announcer every week has pointed out that he is holding the ball too long. We've seen clips of receivers open week in and week out and wentz looking the other way and taking unnecessary sacks over and over.

it's like watching someone trying to dig a ditch with a rake and fans defending the person saying , look how hard he's digging instead of asking why he's not using a shovel. It doesn't matter how hard wentz tries to dig the ditch if he's using the wrong tool. He's here to stay, and if he wasn't benched last night, he's not getting benched. Seeing someone get paid as an elite qb and after 5 years have one good year is frustrating to watch. The last 3 years and now this one, have proven he's average at best with some wow moments sprinkled in."
nfl,"Should be happy for a win but I’m honestly just sick of watching wentz and the team as a whole. If we win the division , we get a game to lose and drop what ten spots in the draft? It’s been kinda the same shit the past 3 seasons."
eagles,Yes
eagles,This team gets no more time from my eyeballs
Genshin_Impact,You are soling the 90 level domains after just hitting 40 and it’s a breeze? I envy you.
nfl,"Only about half the base. Wentz in 2016 was the exception not the rule. I don’t see how you can defend just how bad he plays, but they do."
nfl,"When will it be enough for half our fan base that wentz is really slow at processing the game after the snap and is just not fucking good.

I feel like I need to treat the eagles like an nba game and just check in during the fourth quarter cause they just don’t play football for a full game.

Dallas has let up historical yardage and points, you get a tight end and receiver back and you can only muster 1 score in a half. 

Send dough packing with wentz in the bag. Ffs, I’m tired of watching this guy and listening to fans scream excuses or that he’s back to being elite after playing good for 3 minutes a fucking game."
eagles,Doug and wentz fighting over  who can make the worst decisions on offense.
eagles,"A defense that has let up a historic amount of points , should be easy Pickens against them right? Wentz, “hold my ... oops dropped the beer”"
eagles,Ten minutes of good ply from wentz is enough for some people I guess. Between ints and fumbles he’s gotta be closing on 20 turnovers by himself midway through the season.
Genshin_Impact,"I was trying to hold off on hitting 40. I’ve just been enjoying what the game throws at me and my characters are a mess and I still have hundreds of chests to find.

The mobs are a bit tankier and I noticed how lacking some of my equipment is but it’s not impossible, or frustratingly difficult.

Now the domains? They are a huge step up. If you whales your way through the game, had the characters and resources to upgrade right when you dinged 40, maybe it’s easy. For me with minimal money spent and needing to farm resources at ar 40, domains are only possible via co op."
politics,How do you develop immunity to a disease that comes back again after already having it?
Genshin_Impact,"As long as you learn a lesson then that’s all it is, a lesson learned. I learned mine in fifa years ago. Now, I don’t even get tempted by these games. Remember it’s designed for you to lose more than you win. If you threw 100$ at the game and got every character miyoho would have nothing to sell you. This is the same way casinos stay in business. 

If you can’t control your urges, stop playing though. Gambling is a disease."
Genshin_Impact,"I really don't think the game is predatory. that's a dangerous word to use and should be reserved for games like FIFA where it's competitive and the boxes are designed to pull in money using the competitive edge.

Genshin is restrictive , but you don't need any of the gambling nature of hero collecting to progress or succeed. No one is forcing people to play 20 hours a day, using resin either. 

Does it suck? yes, it's stupid that you can spend 100$ on a video game and not get Messi or Ronaldo or Klee. The difference is that in predatory games, those lootboxes impact your overall success in a versus environment.

Streamers dropping thousands and flaunting their results to users is just irresponsible. Promoting a psychological behavior with the excuse of ""it's my job"" is shitty and will always be shitty. 

I laugh when folks say things like ""i have expendable income"" , or ""it's a gacha you should expect it"". there's no thing as expendable income, when you get to my age you are going to look back at the thousands you think you can throw away and really regret it. Second, just because something is being done as a standard , ie gacha's, doesn't make it an acceptable format.

these games , especially mobile ones, do this because people like you and streamers allow it. If you really think any video game is worth 400$ a year to play, or more, by all means just own up and say to yourself ""im gladd i pay 400$ a year for this""."
Genshin_Impact,What artifacts and weapon setup are people using to maximize klee’s usefulness.
Genshin_Impact,"my f2p is also lucky, and i've put maybe a day into playing it.

https://imgur.com/a/B6KYoPO"
Genshin_Impact,"I hate it because teh weapon, primos , are the least important to me. It's the mora and mats that I needed to get it for and it really sucks I paid to progress."
Genshin_Impact,"keqing, has fencer poses and her actions mimic those. She's got the most satisfying auto attack combo in my opinion as well. All her abilities feel like they represent her style. My favorite character in the game so far that i've played."
Genshin_Impact,"yes but the reason these games are so popular is that people like me and you are actually the exception and not the rule. They make millions because the normal people, are in fact the ones throwing thousands at these games."
Genshin_Impact,"Wow, good on him for this. It's incredible he recognizes it. I've watched his streams and really hated seeing how much he spent without realizing he was ecouraging this predatory stuff. I am just glad he's putting it out there and realizing content creators (games like fifa and what not) promote this behavior on their viewers."
Genshin_Impact,"I spent on my ps4 account (about 70$ total, blessing, bp, and the 49$ gem pack to start). That account has venti, and jean and traveler as my only 5 stars. Not a lot of good 4 stars or weapons etc.. THe account is AR 39.

My pc account, i made for kinda when I was in bed or bored or w/e to play on mobile is free to play and only AR 20. I have venti, qiqi, jean, keqing, and traveler along with a ton of useful 4 stars (sucrose, razor etc..). Not a dime spent, and far better than my ps4.

So, as a logical old man i look at twice the work on my ps4 with  and money invested vs my pc account , no investment, no time investment and much better results by not spending.

choice is simple, i am not giving them another dime unless it's something tangible like a costume or something."
Genshin_Impact,"well, i mean you are basically running 20 leylines, and 20 domains for no rewards. it is a choice, but the weekly bosses do require it right? I forgot you can do run them with no resin , i just hate doing it. thanks for correcting me on that."
Genshin_Impact,"it's the choices and the resin wall that impact you.

So what WILL happen is you will get to 50 or 60 on a few characters pretty easy. Then you have talents, weapons, leveling, artifacts, ascensions, and all that jazz as well as mora. 

You only have 120 resin, soon to be 160 i think. This limits what you can do daily, and when farming materials you also have to deal with rng. 

So, if you are needing levels, then you have to focus your resources on just leveling. That'll give you 6 leylines a day currently or 8 after 1.1. This is really not a lot and you'll be clearing leylines at 70 to 80 for a while. This becomes a problem witht he battle pass also, which requires you to do domains, world bosses, etc.. for bp exp.

It's not impossible to level, it's just over punishing the player for wanting to level a character. THe problem with this game, is at end game you really can't focus on different types of progression at once. You have to focus on one thing, but then have to do requirements for weeklies/dailies as well. 

again, not impossible but for the reasons above, it fucking sucks and makes the game a pain in the ass to enjoy late game. this is really impactful when you are AR 40+ and pull a new 5 star character or weapon."
eagles,"If we played the whole game like we did in the 4th against Baltimore. The whole game like the 1st against Washington. If they can play a full football game instead of bursts of good play, they can beat anyone. This teams worst enemy is themselves right now."
Genshin_Impact,"Yah, sucks I threw money at my PS4 account. I only made the pc account to occupy time driving, on webinars and stuff like that. I just keep pulling good characters, and after another 5 figured I’d just stop playing the PS4 account. 

I’ll give razor a little more time playing. Was using keqing as my primary deeps."
Genshin_Impact,Thanks. Open world I’ll fill as needed but for abyss I was curious.
Genshin_Impact,"so my ps4 account that i actually spent money on has 2 five stars , jean and venti and nothing else. Have had bad luck with 4 star rolls, you name it. ar 38

My free to play account, ar 20, just keeps getting lucky and lucky. So, i am plugging a controller into my pc and retiring from ps4. This is my free to play account below. Can someone recommend me a good team that synergizes well?

https://imgur.com/a/B6KYoPO"
nfl,Maybe he’s just trying to channel his inner wentz.
Genshin_Impact,"If you are playing free to play , not much to complain. This game sucks for people who want to pay,  just not 400$ for a 5 star. Someone like me, who has no problems throwing 60$ at a game and 10-20$ here and there. It’s actually better to spend nothing than spend a little bit, that’s the real problem. You choose to either spend nothing and never have anything or drop thousands, there’s no satisfaction in the middle."
Genshin_Impact,"I can’t take him out of my team, I didn’t even level him forever. I just popped field and went to work with fisch, xiang, etc. now I am maxing him out because he is just too good."
eagles,"one of my favorite all time eagles players. was so stoked to put his jersey back on and those two td's against washington gave me so much hypes. After the offseason events, and another year of no productions, I wish him well and thanks for the memories but there is no way he's in an eagle's uniform next year."
nfl,"No worries, I didn’t take offense my dude. It’s a weird dynamic."
nfl,"I’m in my mid 40s and her in her mid 30s. I think just from being older, I vote for who I want but I’ve been hearing Clinton is going to take my freedom away , Bush is going to take it away , etc... that I just try to live a good life and roll with the punches. Until political profiting goes away none of these people are there for you. They may start out that way but they never end that way."
nfl,this is the correct answer.
nfl,"oh, i don't care if people know. she's a trump supporter."
nfl,"it's not, i am quiet most of the time in hopes that when the election comes to pass she'll move on."
nfl,"he should have had a touchdown last night, one was carson not having faith in him, and one was him just a little bit out of bounds on a perfect throw by wentz. I hope he continues this trend. 

he looked solid last night again."
Genshin_Impact,"I think this game , for free to play players is best designed to run it once and just come back for new content. There is no real progression outside of abyss and I just don't think the rewards are worth the effort. There's no pvp, no guilds, the co-op experience meh at best. 

There's a major gap where people need to realize, light spending in this game is not worth it. You either go f2p or whale. It's honestly better to light your money on fire than it is to throw 10-20$ here and there at this game. 

i am ar38, and last night was really the first night i didn't feel like logging just because i didn't have the energy to chest hunt, or go through and see what resources i needed to farm and far off i was on getting what i needed to get done. I have characters I want to play but there's absolutely no way, I am grinding out another one. I love the game and feel like i got my 60$ worth that i threw at it, but i just don't see myself continuing down this path. The best weapons in this game are gacha. The resources are gates and paid, and every corner you turn there is something either paywalled or timegated. Outside of exploring the world for the lowest end resources, what is there?

I am looking forward to the story continuation because surprisingly i like the lore, but i guess my driive to play is in that diminishing point and find myself back on gamepass looking to see what i can play."
nfl,"well thats why the wife wants me to watch, to ""change my mind"" and give him a chance."
nfl,"my wife comes in, ""ready to watch the debates?"", and i say ""eagles is on babe"". She says they suck, and proceeds to tell me how i don't care about the future of our country and all that. We are on polar opposites of the political spectrum and there was a point in the game, as an eagles, fan i almost wanted to go watch the debates."
nfl,Is no one talking about the colts punt two point conversion?
eagles,I’ll go through the week confused about wentz.
eagles,Um.... yay?
eagles,"Wentz will get another shot and get us down to the 5 where Doug will call 3 fades in a row.

Half the base will call wentz playing hero ball working with nothing. The other half will point out lapses of good play week in and out.

Half us will call the other half dumb morons, and all it’ll be back to normal this week just like the last 6."
eagles,Djax is back and not one shot downfield.
eagles,"Bad play calling, followed by horrible oline play and an inconsistent qb. I mean , what exactly would you hope for if we even won the division? We can’t seem to play a whole football game. Defense mostly holds up all game then gives up a 97 yard , 9 minute drive. 

I have never seen a team so disconnected."
eagles,3rd and 1 and 4th and 1 haven’t been great for us this year.
eagles,Looks like a different wentz tonight. Keep it up!
Genshin_Impact,"i've decided to just roll when i have the primos, if it's once a day, or once every two days, don't matter. The rates are not worth spending money on, so it's miyoho's loss in their pockets. I like the game, but hate the nickle and dimed progression, the best weapons being paid, and requirements for some characters to have constellation in order to be competitive. 

Good luck to those that feel this is actually worth throwing money at, but my wallet is closed to the gambling portion of this game. I threw 60$ at it on release which was more than worth it in terms of enjoyment. I may get the 4.99$ a month and that's it (not sure if i'll get the bp in it's current state)."
eagles,"people only remember the 1 quarter of last week and not the trend of games where he has played 75% looking like a bad backup that wouldn't be on any team. You can say he did better the last two weeks, but to say he did ""good"" is a stretch."
nfl,"he played good for about 5 minutes of the game, must be elite. Had 2 dropped td's, then the receivers bailed him out, along with the refs, and baltimore by dropping an int. he gave up another costly fumble giving the ravens free points but because he tried and had 3 or 4 good passes he's back to being a top qb."
nfl,"that wentz has a receiver drop another touchdown while playing shitty for 3 quarters and the fan base blaming everyone else except him for another week. 

I either want him to play consistent football or just suck at this point."
eagles,no
Genshin_Impact,"The sense of defeat I feel is making it hard for me to continue. I threw some money at this game , but I can’t afford to pay for these rates, I just can’t. Love the game but if I have to spend 500$ to get the new chatlracter every month or two it’s just not gonna happen."
Genshin_Impact,"I had 6k gems saved after getting lucky with venti. I didn’t pull Klee and honestly just think I’m done. I dropped 60$ and another 10$ on the battle pass, I don’t want to go through this battle every month. I want the characters but I’m not throwing hundreds at a video game I paid for , every month. I feel like I’m taking idiot pills playing this to get the characters."
Genshin_Impact,i use ning but with the 5 star catalyst. I also have jean on a flute in my party. I use chong as well and razor but they are mostly in for mining.
Genshin_Impact,maybe i'll pull on the banner for sucrose cons and hope to get klee. i been farming viridescent but no luck on the set dropping. i've done about 4 days of farming and not one piece has dropped.
Genshin_Impact,"yah, that's the thing with venti i am starting to not enjoy. Where i really want him to be effective he's not. I have better damage with focused elemental burst. for trash clearing it's great but is the cc really that beneficial when i can just use someone like jean in place? 

it's really about getting a more consistent fire user to proc my electro burst with fischl and i was hoping klee could do that."
Genshin_Impact,wondering how a venti ult followed by klee and then into electric would work? ideal or not?
Genshin_Impact,"i have sacred winds on ning, and the bow was my second choice. I am glad you let me know. I'll keep using my compound/favonis bows. 

so, it'll be the sword more than likely. i have flute, sacrificial. for claymores, i have rainslasher and sacrificial. 

hard choice..."
Genshin_Impact,general consensus on the best weapon from the battle pass? Assuming I have a 5 star that can use each ( i don't but was wondering what the if you have x character this is best).
Genshin_Impact,"it was hard to do the big achievement at first on ps4 and world level 4. 

It was forgettable to be honest. The rewards, the loading times on ps4 co op. I'll take anything free but it wasn't something I'd look forward to doing again."
Genshin_Impact,"i'll give that a whirl, thanks."
Genshin_Impact,"struggling building a team for exploration and as my default team. 

I have Keqing, Jean , venti as my 5 stars.

4 stars , fischl 3c, xiang max c, razor 1 c, ning , barbara

rest are the free ones, noelle, lisa etc.."
eagles,"I watched the game and saw receivers drop two passes and then the receivers make incredible catches. He’s not a good qb. Up until the prayer throws and a questionable pi he was sub 50% , lost another fumble, and luckily had an int dropped. 

Jfc, it’s not all his fault but saying he played some sort of stellar game is far the truth. He’s not good, the oline is not good, the play calling is not good. 

Only thing this game showed me is Baltimore isn’t that good."
eagles,The absolute worst 2pt conversion I’ve ever seen in the history of football
eagles,Please put hurts in just for a change pace
eagles,“And ertz falls down”
eagles,Just take wentz out it honestly can’t get worse
eagles,Every time hurts comes in we look alive
eagles,"Just kick the xp, jfc."
eagles,Our defense is mediocre but our offense is worse. That’s the extent of everything I’ve seen this season.
eagles,"I don’t think Carson is as good as people think. I don’t think Doug is as good as people thought. 2017, was nothing more than the ugly kid getting the girl and I’m fine with that. I just wish we had some fucking intensity on this team."
eagles,This looks like a team that expects to lose now but is hoping to just score some points to save face .
eagles,Wow
eagles,Why do these announcers not want us to catch the ball?
eagles,The right leg comes down no?
eagles,"Serious, if they play like that at least they’re trying. Nothing else works, throw the kitchen sink. Most excited I been all season has been this drive."
eagles,There we go!
eagles,"5 , 3 and outs , a fumble , and what 5 sacks already? 

No one has any heart on this team, coach included. I’ve seen us play scared way to many times , it’s embarrassing. Ravens too good, might as well not try. That’s honestly what it looks like."
eagles,"Wentz is the worst qb in football , and it’s not even close."
eagles,"Why is it always an excuse for everything? We aren’t the only team that has to overcome adversity. Wentz just threw 2 bad passes in a row to cost a possession and runs erect into 3 defenders that literally just grab the football. 

At least see what we have with hurts , we are 1/3 the season in and he still can’t throw a football consistently or protect it."
eagles,More points given to the opponent by wentz. Fucking guy is responsible for about 40 points against this season.
eagles,"? He just threw two shitty passes. They’re all bad , wentz included."
eagles,Punter the only breaking a sweat today
eagles,The secret recipe to beating this team has been the same for the past decade. Throw slants at the linebackers.
Genshin_Impact,Yah I’m at ar36 and material farming only.
Genshin_Impact,"I read that there are some glitches with her abilities. I don’t have diluc or Bennett and the only reason I’d pull her is to have a better character for fire farming in exploration. I think, it’s best to wait a couple weeks and see what’s coming down the pipe from miyoho . She will be on banner for a while so you can weigh your options a bit. 

I have fully leveled Chong and wouldn’t mind some cons for him which is tempting me also."
Genshin_Impact,"Yes , and I probably should have been more clear. It’s not artifacts themselves. It cost resin to farm the good ones. I ran the domain for the anemo artifacts and ran out resin two days in a row while not having one drop. Third day I got one , with horrible rolls. So, what I mean is that resin actually controls my artifact farming on top of everything else."
Genshin_Impact,"No one has issues with them making money. But little things being nickel and dimed for gets old. Not enough resin for a daily, not enough primos for a wish in an event, not enough mora, not enough resources. We all get the time investment and limits. I’d rather have time restrictions then inventory expansions per character like most ftp games or a monthly sub that gives auction house access and what not. Criticizing the free to play model isn’t saying the game isn’t worth it or saying it’s a rip off. But to ignore the pay model flaws and white knight it is just as silly."
Genshin_Impact,"When I strted I thought the Gacha rates were the problem. Then, I leveled and played and thought resources were the problem. Then, I thought resin was the problem. Further down the road at ar36 , resin was the problem. Lastly, rng artifacts are the problem.

I’ve realized that this game has some sort of hurdle for each and every aspect.

Want a new character? Fuck you, pay mi 

Need more resources? Fuck you, pay mi

Need more domain runs? Fuck you, pay mi

The whole game is a test in patience and planning, realizing time invested isn’t nearly as important as micro managing and planning. For example, my jean need 3 days of play to ascend her weapon , and ascend the character. I can’t do anything else outside of that. When your character are 70, the resources , moras, and resin are just not there and it becomes a little bit each day and one day you get there. 

I don’t have a problem with the progression, I have a problem with the lack of other activities you can’t do while doing this. 

You add rng artifact farming and mora into, and it’s just too much to handle."
politics,The fact a vaccine for a virus that’s killing a thousand a day in our country is somehow political makes me sick.
politics,"You know what people are sick of? Not standing by your convictions, when you say these people are doing terrible things to our country and then laugh, hug, and have outings with them we wonder if you are lying to us or to them."
eagles,"pass rush against shitty o-lines and bad offenses. Against the rams they were torched, against the steelers they were torched. Having good defense against the bengals and a rookie qb, or san fran with their struggles doesn't make the eagles defense anything to be happy about.

they're average at best, much like the offense. They aren't terrible, they aren't good, they're just kinda there."
eagles,"til, thank you."
eagles,"just out of curiosity and not a eagles financial analyst.. So, if he lights it up the rest of the year , what's keeping him here? How would we be able to pay him if he wants to go?"
Genshin_Impact,"when you get to ar 35+, the resources and mora look real nice in the battle pass. The only reason i have not got it, is i am waiting to max it first. If i don't max it, I am not getting it but i really do look at it at least a few times per session salivating over the additional resources."
Genshin_Impact,"i see , through the day tons and tons of useful hidden chests and cool secrets. is there a repository of all this information somewhere?"
Genshin_Impact,"55$ at release. the 49$$ gems and the 5$ monthly. I'll probably only do the 5$ monthly going forward. The battle pass, is just to much work for me. I don't like the checklist aspect of gameplay , so i take the rewards as I get them. I am ar 35 and haven't even hit level 20 on the battle pass. 

If i could do it all over again, i'd had just spent the 5$. The gems aren't worth it but i'd had paid 50$ for this game anyways."
Genshin_Impact,"i can do some things like my dailies and what not on my mobile, but when it comes to boss fights and jumping puzzles, i have to log into my pc."
Genshin_Impact,how did you get the mora to do this?
Genshin_Impact,"not saying the traveler is bad, but jean is one of the best 5 stars in the game. She has good scaling, self sustain, and not only provides those bonuses, she also has an incredible burst ability."
eagles,"i watched the highlights yesterday, since i was out of town. One thing really stood out to me, and it infuriates me so much, this watch the hands coverage of our cb's since the chip kelly days. There was a pass from ben that was in the air for like 20 seconds, lobbed ball, and our cb is just staring directly at the wr. I think there's a chip plant, on the cb coaching staff that still thinks just running in stride with a receiver is enough. The only int's we've gotten in the past decade have been passes qb's throw directly to our secondary. 

our defense has been inconsistent and often times overrated since schwartz got here."
Genshin_Impact,"getting an assload of characters matters little since you'll be begging for mora and resources to get 2 to 3 characters end game ready. 

pay attention to the anemoculus/geoculus you collect, so you don't have 1 left and have to scavenge the whole map looking for one.

artifacts matter, more than your weapon and hero. Level up any artifact 1 level you may want to keep since you can't lock or flag for trash. 

save important locations. 

all resources are important in some way, don't skip any. 

understand how the elements work , team building is more important than anything else. If you have someone that is designed to trigger burst, build them to trigger burst. 

Look up, down, and all around every where you go. There's so many things in this game hidden right above you. 

some general tips:

get your statues upgraded as fast as possible, and explore a lot in between the story doing it. Stamina abundance is a godsend later in the game. 

save your resin, until you have a plan. Don't use it just to use it. Think about what you are using it on first and where that resin will go. Again, character progression is the biggest hurdle in this game not the gacha. 

make a few team builds. Don't force yourself into one comp. you may be in the southern continent and need geo for everything, so make a geo team instead of stopping to switch out characters.

use the adventurer's handbook 

think for yourself before taking advice. some people will tell you things like , the 3 star weapon is better than the 5 star. Don't blindly listen to those things. Base stats on 4 and 5 stars are higher, and check that the % increase of a 3 star is actually better. 

do your expeditions on 24 hour with characters you have absolutely no intention of using, and keep up with it."
nfl,It’s a shame that he suffered an injury during such an incredible start. Dallas is an average defense away from being a powerhouse.
Genshin_Impact,"

I would go venti, keqing, fischl, xiang or chong, keqing, fischl and whatever you elemental reaction you want for your fourth.

chong then keqing/fischl is fun as hell."
Genshin_Impact,lol anyone that does damage.
Genshin_Impact,"I play on ps4, it's brutal with the load times."
Genshin_Impact,"I'll give you one glaring example of why this tier lists hurts more than it helps:

14. Ningguang (Geo, Catalyst)

lol, pass. These tier lists are just bad for players who want to look into the game. Ning is one of the best dps characters in the game. This game is about team comp and not characters. Putting into a  players mind that x character is not good , with any of these characters is doing a disservice. Amber in a group that synergizes is better than diluc in a group that doesn't."
Genshin_Impact,"Don’t hold onto something you don’t enjoy anymore. Getting 20, 30, 40, or over 100 hours doesn’t make it a bad game. If you enjoyed your time the game was good. You don’t have to keep playing it for it to be a good game. It’s okay to leave and come back and it’s okay to say there’s nothing to do after 40+ hours. There’s no pvp, no guilds or real social gameplay, and it’s definitely not an mmo. So , sit back , relax , and be entertained. When the entertainment wears off, move on to something else."
eagles,Went on track for 32 interceptions this year?
eagles,"Remember this the next time we play a crappy offense and a crappy oline, and our defense looks good and you think they are good."
eagles,"I’m on vacation in the Florida keys, not trolling but just checking in to see how we look. Anyone give me a quick rundown?"
Genshin_Impact,"I’d just be happy if they mad the daily resin quest 120 or gave us 150 resin daily to spend. I’m not getting the bp this month , because I won’t max it , won’t pay to max it, and not spending 10$ for just the weapon and the wishes."
Genshin_Impact,Craft a ton of hp food
Genshin_Impact,"Listen my dude, I’m 100% with you. PS4 sucks I terms of performance. But please, go and break up your post into a few paragraphs. For mobile at least, it was hard to read. 

Again, I agree 100% on your point."
Genshin_Impact,"She can press auto attack and teleport. How much more of an explanation do u need? Do you have her? If so, go and auto attack and see how she plays."
Genshin_Impact,You can spam her attack and never get hit. Like ever.
Genshin_Impact,"What’s not true? She has an almost spammable burst, more iframes than any character?"
Genshin_Impact,"If you enjoy the game, wait on the battle pass. Buy it only when you think you can reach max level. 

The 4.99 deal is an absolute steal when comparing prices.

At 7 you should have 2 beginner banner summons guaranteed noelle. Then 2 ish for the venti banner. 

If you are unhappy with what you have there , you can buy gems with a double bonus on first time purchase. Just be aware it’s a .6% chance , not 6 but .6 . 

Gl and have fun it’s a great game !"
Genshin_Impact,"If you build venti outside of nothing but burst spam , you are wasting what he is used for. He’s not a main dps , his goal is to cc and swirl that’s it."
Genshin_Impact,"If you have keqing, you know she’s the best character in this game."
Genshin_Impact,Have u done all the 1 time domains? Maxed staues? Did the side quests?
Genshin_Impact,"It’s like, we are forcing you to use 120 but it’s not enough for anything significant but in order to complete the battle pass please log in , in 5 hours for nothing significant but necessary."
Genshin_Impact,where is the little island? on the map.
Genshin_Impact,"i've made an exception with this game playing an unhealthy amount for me , which is about 3-5 hours a day. Typically, i get home from work and take care of my girls and wife, eat, and spend time with them. i get about 1-2 hours at most for me if my old ass can stay up long enough. 

Genshin has been so addicting to me, i've snuck out to my man cave and played an extra 2 or so hours each night and living off half a gallon of caffeine to get through the days. Even so, with all that i have tons and tons of stuff to do in game still. I can't imagine dedicating the equivalent of a work day to a game for weeks on end. but, if you do, it's no wonder the game starts to feel like a job.

I am back to my 1 to 2 hours a night now, so what the game provides is the perfect amount of time for me to enjoy playing it."
nfl,"as an eagles fan, i think seeing alshon laying on the field after the drop against the saints. 

As a general football fan, matt ryan after the superbowl."
Genshin_Impact,"i mainly play on ps4 ar 33, but my pc account free to play is like wish gold with luck . ar 15 and the following lineup:

https://imgur.com/a/RoL5PTv

what is the optimal team build here?"
Genshin_Impact,"nothing feels as good as rolling an gladiator artifact into def% and then into def... /s 

feels like im playing epic 7 and watching my 4 speed ring roll into effective resistance 4 times."
Genshin_Impact,"thanks, i must be doing something wrong. I'll have to look at my team comps."
Genshin_Impact,"what lineup did you primarily use to clear abyss 9? as a free to play, that seems like some incredibly lucky pulls on not just characters but also weapons. 

I can survive abyss, but i just can't do the damage and by my math there'd been no way of getting the upgrades to do it. Is there some cheesing way to do it or soemthing?"
Genshin_Impact,"I am ar 33, and still at 9 on both statues, exploring, and have quests to do. 

My issues with the game are more qol stuff.

The ps4 loading times are awful, and co-op should really be more enjoyable. 

My biggest issue on console though, is the impossibility of upgrading artifacts without any identifier on what materials you are using. I wish i could mark some as trash so they are the first ones fed. I honestly hate the artifact upgrade system more than anything. 

I can see being burnt out though, it's very repetitive. I am at a point where, i can do most of what i want to do and focus on my characters now. I enjoy that, so farming certain bosses, domains, and materials isn't bothering me much. I am restricted on what i can do now,  about an hour after playing each day and instead of my usual get home from work and play til my eyes bleed i play a little bit and move on to another game now."
Genshin_Impact,"when i spent 40$ on the double gems. i did half manually and the other half with ten pulls. I got the same garbage no matter how i did it. But yes, if you pull on a banner for, let's say venti ,and get him your 2nd pull in a ten stack pull you've effectively wasted 8 wishes if that's all you wanted. Individual is better for free to play players. Any people saying pulling ten at once gives better results is just superstitious. Each pull has it's .0000000000000000006% chance in that 10 bulk pull you don't get any sort of increase in rate by pulling 10 at once."
Genshin_Impact,they know.
Genshin_Impact,"guess i should feel real fucking lucking pulling venti with only 40$ spent. jfc, that's disgusting to read, and even more disgusting people throw that kind of money at the game."
Genshin_Impact,"i'd probably roll on the banner then to round out your team, that's just me though."
nfl,"""30. PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
There was a reasonable argument to be made that the public overrated Carson Wentz a bit, but no one — not even the biggest of haters — expected him to come out and start 2020 like this. Through the first four weeks, Wentz is the NFL’s lowest-graded passer (43.5) and has produced an NFL-high 14 turnover-worthy plays. That’s six more than anyone else and tied for the most by a quarterback in the first four games of a season in the PFF era.

Accuracy has always been an issue for Wentz. But this year, it went from something a team could live with to a liability. On throws of 10 or more yards, 57% of Wentz's passes have been uncatchable. That’s 10 percentage points worse than the quarterback that ranked last in that metric in 2019. It might be time to put in rookie Jalen Hurts.""

Wentz had a somewhat below average game, and the eagle's sub is all, ""wentz is back!"", PFF calling it like it is with this analysis. he's still playing awful despite one good throw last week."
Genshin_Impact,"battle pass is a ripoff right now. It needs to be balanced better. 

So, to answer your question. 28 is the ugh level. You will need to just grind it out, i used some resin to finish 28, so if you have an abundance of resin (i think i had around 18 when i used a few), do so. 

Once you hit 29, the quest chain will get you about 80% through 29, and then 4 world quests open up that will pull you within 90 ish % and you'll grind some more. 

after 30 it's just a chore though, a few quests pop up but it really just straight popping chests, using resin, and logging off after you are done with commissions and give up on looking for new chests."
Genshin_Impact,"the chances of you pulling venti are low. if you really want him, then i'd use the pulls on the banner but don't be upset if you get another 4 fischl's. 

on your beginner banner x 2, you only pulled noelle? On the two intertwined you pulled fischl, xiang, and barb? No other 4 or 5 stars?"
Genshin_Impact,"Genshin official has been dark the past week on news of any sort. The venti banner is ending in about a week, but no announcements made. Is this normal in HI3? Trying to get a feel for days and times for updated content and what not."
PS4,"The people that love it, really love it. I think it's that style of game that just isn't my flavor but I just don't get the hype over it. I tried it a few times."
PS4,"i'll take the downvotes:

Witcher 3"
Genshin_Impact,"just take it as it comes now. do your resin stuff, commission, and then if you need to upgrade your statues and farm chests. There's some side quests you can look  out for all over the world as well. It really slows down at 28. my worst level so far. gl."
Genshin_Impact,"im playing it like #2 but have played gachas because i like hero collecting. 

Content creators are really just not doing it for me. i've seen a few videos , ""do this to make more primo gems!"", ""level fast by doing this!""....basically the whole video is just, play the game. It doesn't have any need for rushing, any need to be the best, you can take your time and do whatever you want in game. 

Tier lists in this game are straight up bad across teh board. It isn't one character that makes or breaks the game. It's a team, and people should be putting together group compositions that work instead of just saying ""venti op!"". 

I've logged in every day, spent a lot of time on it. Each time i go back to an area i find something new. I honestly love just how relaxing the game is. It's pure entertainment, and it's nice to have a game be a game and not a stressful meta simulator."
Genshin_Impact,"I think the 4.99 daily gems is the only thing worth throwing money into. The battle pass seems a little intense to finish , definitely wait to get the battle pass until you are 100% sure you can finish it.

The gem top ups provide double so , you are essentially getting the most bang for your buck on the first time purchases (1 time double the gems)

I hope they come out with some things I can just buy. Throwing money at .6% chance is fucking stupid no matter what mental gymnastics you use to justify it to yourself. I experimented with the 40$ pack since I got 80$ in gems. Total waste. Remember the people postin their lucky pulls are the exception and not the rule."
Genshin_Impact,"i think this is a nice QoL change to the game. I am not really hating re-exploring because i tunnel visioned some quests and am picking up some chests re-exploring. But , I know that now needing on a few of each for level 10 statues, i am going to be miserable tonight doing it."
Genshin_Impact,"and then you have two problems which is 1 to 2 , 5 stars a year and then no dupes on top of rng. imagine being unlucky and getting the ""bad"" 5 star twice in one year. My point is the gacha in this game seems to be a recipe for disaster for free to play, and dolphins. Whales may end up spending more than they anticipated."
Genshin_Impact,"A lot of people think being upset with the Gacha is bashing the game and it’s not. I love the game but hate the system. 

I spent 50$ on it to get venti, and there’s no way my wife would let me throw 50-100$ at the game every banner. 

Looking at what I can accumulate per month with minimal dollars here and there it’s actually better to not spend any money at all than it is to throw 10-20$ at it from time to time. 

I feel like the breaking point for me is when we are several 5* released characters in and I’m having none."
Genshin_Impact,"That’s the name of the weapon. Remember you get more max damage from the weapon rarity , so the bonus may not be worth a fully maxed 4 or 5 star weapon in most cases."
Genshin_Impact,"barbara + anyone is good enough to get you through the game. 

you have a tough choice to make , though because fischl is such a great character. 

You can run chong, xiang, fischl, and barbara/ venti . Weapons vary by what you have access to. do you have a 5 star claymore? do you have the mats to craft? you can run with a 3* quartz and wreck the battlefield."
Genshin_Impact,"they don't do much outside of having a party bonus and the swirl effect. you'll still need a burster but , you can  make it work like this.

venti to gather - xiang to drop some jalapeno bear - fischl to initiate the burst - jean to finish it all off."
Genshin_Impact,"https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Common_Ascension_Material

you can use the wiki for just about everything. they are doing an incredible job putting all the resources in there."
Genshin_Impact,"you can go instructor for the big elemental burst, and then go for any two piece that boosts attack damage. That way you would provide some utility to your team while also being able to do some damage."
Genshin_Impact,"5th and 6th gen ipads (mine ) , the game doesn't load the resources properly, so it's all black with some of the major textures. runs great on my iphone x, but my ipad can't run it and that's really the device i want to play it on."
Genshin_Impact,"max refined, it makes it impossible for me to switch out of my barbara into fischl combo. the nuke is crazy , when i get the mobs wet and then drop the bird on a group."
Genshin_Impact,has there been any update on the ipad issues?
Genshin_Impact,https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Thrilling_Tales_of_Dragon_Slayers
Genshin_Impact,"chong wishes. Seems you are pretty early in the game and haven't gotten all the free summons done yet. 

I'd run trav, xiangling, noelle, fischl. (kaeya worse than amber imo).

Start the fight with xiang, dropping jalapeno bear. Switch to fischl, drop bird on mobs for nuke. switch to noelle or traveler. That'll be the combo you want to use."
Genshin_Impact,forget the name but there is one where when you switch off barbara you get a huge attack buff increase. use that one.
Genshin_Impact,"i have her on my pc account, and diluc on my ps4 account. the struggle is real because i love both of them so much."
Genshin_Impact,the teleport wins it for me. Diluc is sexy deeps though. Tough call.
Genshin_Impact,"it's kinda just a feature of the game and not really end game. It's great for domains you may need help with later in the game, and world bosses as they are a lot tougher the higher you go. 

You can totally live without it though."
Genshin_Impact,"the load times are pretty bad. if they'd fix the game for my 2 year old ipad, i'd probably quit on console."
Genshin_Impact,"cathedral, always a 5 star in the ""spot"""
Genshin_Impact,"""50 ten pulls being nothing but weapons.""

i call bullshit on this. 50 ten pulls is 500, you'd had hit pity twice. So is it 90 pulls or 50 ten pulls? that's a bid difference, and i'll tell you in 90 pulls you still would pulled more than you stated here. 

The game is free, like totally free. They make their money off characters. Want characters? pay some money. I threw 40$ down on the double gems, it's all im going to pay for outside of the battle pass. Did i get the characrers i wanted? eh, not really. but there is no way you only got weapons with 500 pulls. 

Second, it's a single player open world. If you are rank 28, there is no way you have finished all your upgrades, found all the chests and finished all the quests. If you are rank 28, that also means you've probably been playing for several hours a day. Take a break. It's a video game, it's meant to provide you enjoyment. It's not a pvp competitive game where you can flex to anyone anyways. It's meant to be played for personal enjoyment. If exploring, and building your characters isn't fun, you shouldn't play it. It's a simple game design, and not meant to have a bunch of people competing for some sort of , ""im number 1!"" , weird e-ego. 

Dupes are awesome, and having xiang maxed constellation and fischl maxed constellation is nothing to complain about even if i really only wanted beidou. I want ronaldo every FIFA the first week, but it never happens ."
Genshin_Impact,"it runs on my iphone x, but does not run on my 6th gen ipad"
Genshin_Impact,You get 2 beginner banner pulls and another chunk of primo to buy a 10 pull of intertwined.
Genshin_Impact,"When it comes to 5 stars the constellations are whale only. 4 stars you will get over time, I have fischl maxed already and I only dropped 40$ for the bonus . I won’t spend another penny unless it’s cosmetics or something. As a free to play it looks like you can get about quarter the pity each month."
Genshin_Impact,Have you not done the beginner banner? I don’t see noelle listed. If you haven’t I wouldn’t focus on a team yet until you get your two beginner banner pulls and your 1 venti 10 pull at ar 7
Genshin_Impact,"My team 1 is my questing and world farming team. It’s female mc wind, Barbara, Amber, Chong. 

My team 2 is my dungeon team , bossing team. 

Jean, xiang, fischl, filler (venti/Chong). 

I spent around 70$ on the game. My luck outside of the venti and jean pulls as my only 5’s seemed to be Barbara, fischl, xiang dupes. Both Barbara and xiang at 4 and and fischl maxed . 

I’ve invested all my resources into fischl and her normal attacks are enough for me to shred bosses when starting with xiang. I swap to jean if I need to top off a bit and/or fischl is getting wrecked. I built Jean with all hp and attack as a bruiser type build. 

The open world team is focused around freezing mobs and moving quick around the world. I’ll sometimes pop in venti in place of amber . 

I have put almost all my resources, as said into fischl because of the maxed constellation and I’m using the crafted bow 4star now, two starred to give me a really nice boost in damage with auto attacks."
nfl,rypien had a better qb rating last night than wentz had agains the bengals.
Genshin_Impact,"on my ps4 account ar25, i spent 40$ have fischl, and jean from rolls. that's really it.

on my free to play pc account ar 11, pulled venti, keqing, jean, diluc, razor, ning, and fischl."
Genshin_Impact,"i played a game called closers on my pc with a controller and had no issues. I think i may switch tonight. It wasn't too difficult to get to ar 25 on ps4. you've motivated me, thank you :)"
Genshin_Impact,im going to give it a try tonight. too many great heroes to let them waste away on that account.
Genshin_Impact,"just wanna rant a bit. yesterday was slightly annoyed that my ps4 account that i spend money on has the worst drops and my pc/mobile account (free) keeps getting five stars. My pc account is ar 11, my ps4 ar 25. I have jean on my ps4 and really nothing else of note (fischl and barbara). 

My ar 11 pc account has jean, venti, diluc, and just pulled keqing . if i could play this game on my ipad i wouldn't mind, it's runs perfect on my phone but it's hard for me to play it on there and my pc is just not as fun as sitting with a controller. 

Really hate that an account i didn't intend to play outside of bathroom breaks and long drives is the one with the most bang."
Genshin_Impact,"so much good lightning you have. it'd be a hard call for me, because beidou is incredibly when paired with barbara, and another lightning but you lose cryo/fire. Really solid all around though , and you can't go wrong playing with any make up."
Genshin_Impact,"jean has a heal with her burst and her charged attack and ability do knock up, slow fall and damage on landing (think it's % of health). She's wind and probably my favorite character. It's the only 5* i wanted and pulled her. Without knowing your other characters outside of razor it's hard to say. 

I build her kinda bruisy to do most of my auto attacking damage. I use jean , xiang, fischl, and barbara. 

depending on mob i start with either jalapeno teddy bear, or barbara, then into fischl for the elemental damage and then into jean."
Genshin_Impact,"ahh, so you already purchased the 29.99 one. 10-4"
Genshin_Impact,wait you don't get double on the 29.99? there went the 30$ i was going to give to them tonight if that's the case.
Genshin_Impact,"to add, i have a 6th gen ipad, that gets the black screen."
Genshin_Impact,have an iphone x
Genshin_Impact,"i get the black screen on a 3 year old ipad, but my iphone which is a year older than my ipad runs it better than my ps4. I really want to play it on my ipad, so thanks for the update and hopefully it'll be fixed soon."
eagles,"There's a lot of cases to be made against qb coaching, wr injuries, and playcalling. Still doesn't take away the fact, just watching him play the amount of straight up bad passes , means he's not playing at even an nfl backup level right now. He can't hit a 5 yard screen pass consistently."
Genshin_Impact,"Jean, xiangling, fischl, Barbara"
eagles,"Doug's punched out. now it's reporters/fans that wouldn't be happy no matter how good he did? So, therefore it negates being terrible cause we'd never be happy anyways?

jfc doug, what a shitty way to own up to being awful at coaching football this year."
Genshin_Impact,incredible!
Genshin_Impact,"it's easy in the beginning, the game's challenges isn't really open world mobs, although some of the later game ones are a pain in the rear.

the difficulty in this game really comes when you get to abyss, higher ar world bosses, and finding everything hidden in the game. THis game isn't like diablo or path of exile where you spam abilities, and the challenge comes from a gear check. Some of the chests, puzzles, and exploration is a challenge. 

when you get into end game, thinking you can stand there on one character swinging a sword is a recipe for disaster."
eagles,"gonna root for the team and wentz to succeed but he's at a point now where he's played so bad that unless he goes on some sort of record breaking run, every little mistake is going to be amplified. even more than what's being picked apart now. With the lack of talent receiving, I just don't see it happening. Looking at how the bengals defense played against other opponents and what our offense put out, along with the skins after us, and the rams after us, i'd be surprised if we put up 10 points against san fran. 

Abysmal play this week, is going to be the nail in the coffin across the board."
eagles,"they all share the valid criticism. if wentz needs taylor to throw an accurate 5 yard pass, we have bigger issues.

If you drafted any of a number of depleted skill positions over a qb, maybe we aren't shopping for o-lineman, wr's on craigslist.

conditioning and medical staff? injuries are a part of football, but come on, 2 years in a row with no starting wr's to play and only 4 weeks in..

Ultimately, doug is the head coach. All the blame should go to him. The qb coach, the playcalling. It's not working, and he's in charge of the team. 

There are bigger problems with this team than just qb play though. Giving all that money to someone, who let's be honest, 2017 is now the exception and not the norm for wentz's play until proven otherwise. 

We're old, unhealthy, and have no money next year. 

Schwartz is wildly inconsistent on defense, and until the bengals game had absolutely no pressure. Against good lines we dissapear, and we'll have some game that is an outlier (buffalo last year) that inflates a rush that is non-existent against good teams. 

the list goes on and on, but what really fucking pisses me off. They are not enjoyable to watch. there's no excitement, there's no passion, and every one of them just looks fucking miserable on this team. It honestly reminds me of the body language from the chip kelly days. I hate holding onto the past, but there was a blowout game against the saints and i remember watching it and just feeling straight disgusted by it. Our coach fucking quits in games. you can see it against teams that are elite sometimes."
nfl,Eagles will have a cardboard cutout of foles in the endzone this week.
Genshin_Impact,"you can do a few things against the fire guys. barbara apply wet, drop in fischl, pop bird, and then go to venti. you'll get a huge amount of burst. you can drop in barbara, go to fischl, switch back to barbara. she'll heal through any damage just by auto attacking."
Genshin_Impact,"barbara, diluc, venti, fischl, is an amazing lineup. Applying wet with fischl is sick. I wouldn't change that lineup."
Genshin_Impact,"outside of get gud, anyone have tips on charged ranged attack aiming on mobile?"
Genshin_Impact,"yah, i am going to just wish i could get a solid pull on my ps4 account."
Genshin_Impact,"i know, i know, gacha world problems....incoming. I wanted to enjoy this on my ps4, all my rolls yielding 4 fischl's , 2 xiangs, and 2 barbara. AR 20, and all i really wanted was jean or razor to be honest. 

Since i did all the pre-reg stuff, decided to derp around on my phone a bit here and there. first rolls got me fischl and razor. I hit level 10 a few minutes ago, to my second beginner banner. Get jean and the geo mage girl. Have around 7 intertwined left and 2 acquaints. 3rd pull, venti.. 

I really wanted to play on my ps4, but i have a godlike team on mobile :\ 

actually used money on my ps4 account also..feels bad man."
Genshin_Impact,"Unpopular opinion but I’d go traveler, xiang, Barbara, razor. Get everything wet with Barbara, switch to razor , and use xiang and traveler as need."
Genshin_Impact,Ar 20. That was my goal first week. Just beat the storm terror quest. I’m going to focus on just getting my characters optimized now and getting all the little things done /found in the opening area this week. I’ve touched maybe 20% of the map so far.
Genshin_Impact,"gonna try this when i get home. genshin wanted me to have fischl really bad, and it's really all i got (1 dupe left until max'd constellation and not even ar 20 yet). Pulled barbara with my last pull, and wondered how to fit them in. thank you"
Genshin_Impact,"I didn't think i'd like it at first, but i think of the characters as abilities now. Instead of a normal rpg with one character and 900 abilities and keybinding your foot to a pedal under your desk, you have tons of characters with just a couple abilities. makes managing what you do much easier."
Genshin_Impact,"I came so close to grabbing avengers, but then remembered i preordered desitny 2, borderlands 3, the division 2, and im just waiting now on games. Hopefully avengers finds an identity for itself, it looks visually stunning."
Genshin_Impact,"i like that i went to do a quest, got sidetracked by chests, mob camps, and puzzles for 2 hours and then forgot what quest i was going to do. The immersion of the world is incredible. 

whatever characters i get i get, i did the ps4 pre-order, will get the battle pass and the monthly purchase for daily gems. that's really it for me, until another content pre-order. It's all i really need to enjoy the game."
Genshin_Impact,"to each their own. I am in my 40's, get maybe 2 hours at most a day to play games. I find genshin to be relaxing, and enjoyable. I am tired of competitive games, games where they play themselves, games where money spent is the only form of enjoyment you get. It's huge, it's got tons to explore, tons of quests, and fun mechanics. 

Bringing something like this to mobile is absolutely unreal. 

I don't want something that feels like another job, i am sick of pre-ordering games that are supposed to be AAA yet come out broken. Genshin is free, and it's just enjoyable to play. People approaching this like there is some sort of ""best"" you can be, realizing the game is just mean to be a game you play for yourself not for some sort of e-peen measuring stick. 

I fucking love this game, everything about it. Sure I am hoping for better co-op stuff, guilds, and more social features but the last thing i want this to turn into is WoW, or epic 7, or any of the other games that turn the game into chores. Don't feel like doing dailies in genshin? you aren't going to get kicked from a raid, or suck at pvp, or w/e."
Genshin_Impact,"I’m on a standard ps4 and it’s not good but it’s not unplayable for me. 

What blows my mind is my new iPad can’t play it but 4 year old iPhone can and it runs better on that than the ps4. Hoping they tweak the games performance."
eagles,"we are in a bad situation across the board. You bench wentz, it's acknowledging that the person you just threw all your money at is a wasted investment. You don't bench him and he continues to eclipse winston's int record this year, you look like idiots for giving him the money. 

Listen, wentz is not good right now but neither is the entire offense. I am not sticking up for him, I really don't think he's any sort of eagles legend 5 years in. 2017 was the exception and not the rule, pretty much for him and the coaching staff.

That said, it's not a knee jerk reaction. There are plays to be made that he is not making week in and week out. Each game i've seen at the very least 3 bad passes that were game changers, 2 int's week 1 that cost us the game, 1 int week 2 that took us out of the game, and we only tied yesterday because of PI calls, not because of carson's incredible drive. 

I am able to count his good throw on one hand now in games, opposed to running out of fingers and toes on his bad passes. 

The eagles are a health risk to the players, which, let's really talk about that. How the fuck are we out of receivers ....again?!

I made it 40 years in my life without seeing a championship, so i'll be eternally grateful to all those guys. I don't know what magic it was. Chris long? Blount? Reich? Leadership elevates people in any work environment. good leaders get better productivity. The fact these people can't seem to point the finger at themselves is just another year of excuses, no accountability, and an overall depressing season again. This team really hasn't been fun to watch in 3 years. Because this shit keeps happening, is it a knee jerk reaction to play like this three years after a superbowl win? I don't know, to me, definitely not."
Genshin_Impact,"same, let me know if you can figure it out."
Genshin_Impact,I have a 2 year old iPad and have the same exact issue
eagles,"Nick hits that wide open sanders throw, I know that."
eagles,"Those last three plays on offense did Elliot absolutely no favors and dough was content to give his kicker a 60 yard attempt over even trying to get yards. They have zero passion or heart. I can count wentz good passes on one hand. But what really fucking gets me, what absolutely blew my fucking mind. Dougs playcalling was so bad , I mean trust the process levels of what looks like intentional losing.

The def has its problems but gave us 5 chances to put this away. If not for Cincinnati committing to pi’s on one drive we don’t break 20.

Something is wrong with this team and it’s not just the players. They look like a team , the offense, at least, that doesn’t care. 

I can take a loss when the team fights. This offense is t even competitive."
eagles,"A healthy ir scratch or something. They had it on the broadcast , think that was it."
eagles,Nice sticks defense
eagles,"We may go 0 and 16 , and that’s not an exaggeration. Browns are playing better than us vs Washington"
eagles,"God, another td wipes out by wentz"
eagles,Alright guys. Is it safe to start hoping for some hurts playtime? Or do we need another int?
eagles,Hamstring
bengals,Don’t think you are good! We are just that bad. The best insult I could come up with.
eagles,"If I were a player, and philly wanted me to play. The eagles sucking wouldn’t even cross my mind, I’d be scared of just surviving a fucking season."
eagles,It’s comical at this point.
bengals,"I’m an eagles fan but dropping in to say, burrows has “it”. Dude is legit."
eagles,Burrow throws a beautiful ball.
eagles,Play calling ruined a drive. Shocked.
eagles,A td opening drive here would do a ton for this teams confidence.
eagles,There we go! Signs of fucking life!
eagles,"Well, bad team is bad. News at 11, I guess."
eagles,People don’t realize how much Jenkins masked our absolutely horrid linebackers.
Genshin_Impact,Yes
eagles,Bench him. Now. Just so I can get excited about something.
eagles,"I started wentz over Watson, thinking no way wentz could do bad three weeks in a row. Getting the boot on my fantasy team wentz."
eagles,This the type of game you expect from two of the worst teams in football this year.
eagles,"Have jp carry wentz to the bench and they can both sit there . Jfc, this team is out there looking like they don’t give a shit."
eagles,"Cheap today ,  rolling rock."
Genshin_Impact,PS4 and mobile. I’ll login first on my pc though.
eagles,He had a easy td on 2nd down. Have no clue what is wrong with his decision making skills but this is just hard to watch .
eagles,He had a wide open receiver when he tucked it and ran on second. The announcers even showed it.
eagles,"If wentz turds it up this drive, I may start jumping on the hurts wagon pretty hard. Just a heads before you all start getting on my ass."
eagles,5 picks in two games he’s on track to break winstons record.
eagles,Lol
Genshin_Impact,"My goal is to max out every character they give me. So, there are some characters I really want but I’m setting my expectations low and will just do the best with what I pull."
Genshin_Impact,"I think it's , the fine line, for this game to maintain. A lot of this will probably depend on the rotational heroes in the dust shop as well. If the only way to unlock constellations for 5 stars is through banner pulls....it could take years or thousands to get 1 to full constellation. If they make it too easy to obtain the dupes, then they won't make much profit. 

Getting 4 star constellations, will be much easier, but 5's , whew, what a pain in the arse."
Genshin_Impact,"I plan to play on both mobile using pc credentials and on my ps4. not sure we can really even think about re-rolling on console. On my pc account, i may do it a few times , if i get fischi or beidou i'll stop. Definitely will do the AR 7 route though, by the time you get to 5 you might as well just put one foot in front of the other and do 7."
Genshin_Impact,"This is a question to the mods. With the game's launch coming, and an abundance of traffic probably coming with it, are there any plans for some of the following?

Daily, weekly  megathreads? 

Also, the amount of youtube spam is getting out of control in my opinion. Can we just have a content creator megathread?"
eagles,"one of the few bright spots, he looks good on the field. was open several times on nothing but daylight to the end zone plays, if wentz saw him. Outside of the really costly fumble, he had a productive game. really excited to see him grow, i think he's going to be a great back for years to come."
Genshin_Impact,meanwhile i've gotten nothing but turkey dinners in like 4 days of doing this.
Genshin_Impact,"It's a free to play game, with it's only real source of income being the characters. you can do everything in this game without paying a penny, everything. There is no fee for expanded inventory, or character slots, or pvp access, or anything like that. They make their money off of characters. So, they're gonna be the most expensive aspect of the game. 

Save your fates for your favorite characters, and if you want more then buy more. if you absolutely feel like you can't play the video game without the characters and it's too much , then quit. 

This game has no guilds, no social features, and no competitive aspect of any kind. Co-op is hardly beneficial outside of some achievements. So, it's not a p2w kind of game. 

i feel like people complaining about this haven't played gacha's before. 

The real issue here isn't the generosity itself, it's that you need copies of the heroes. Now, that will suck and will cost extreme amounts of money. There needs to be an alternative to getting constellations on  a hero outside of banner pulling. That will probably force me to leave ultimately."
DissidiaFFOO,"Still new and grinding. I’m on chapter 9 just using noctis to 1 shot everything so far.

I had about 35k saved for this banner and have had pretty horrible luck only pulling one 75cp now as the highest item. It takes me about an hour to clear a chapter which is close to enough for another 10 pulls and I’m on chapter 9 now. Will I get enough to pity this banner or am I running out of the free crystals soon? I still have almost all the lost chapters to complete as well."
eagles,A great qb makes that throw in the small window of time the wr was open. A good qb doesn’t attempt that throw. A bad qb makes that throw thinking they’re a great qb.
nfl,"We had someone post a picture of their vandalized flag on next door. My wife already thinks that biden will build prisons in our neighborhood and the dems will take away every American freedom. 

Somehow someone knew the truth and ultimately the guy said he did it himself so people could see what the democrats will do, lol."
nfl,Then the opposing new station sets headlines that you dont know what your doing. I’m hoping to just a return to real journalism in our lifetime.
eagles,"If I’m in the race for worst qb in the league, I’m not going to say my teammates are bad. That’s seems counterproductive and will just make things worse. Did he really deny that? 

Looking at some of the tape the past two weeks, it seems our receivers aren’t nearly as bad as we think."
EpicSeven,"Lucky , got her on 20th pull. Limited banners have been good to me the last two, it’s nice to not stress over skystones, gold and bookmarks."
eagles,"One important thing to realize through this comparison is that even 20 years ago and we still suck at having good wr on this team. The year we get t.o we go to the Super Bowl and the year we get alshon we go. 

I’m not taking anything away from foles post season run but I don’t think we get to the spot we were in , in 2017 without wentz. 

I also think wentz was grossly overrated when drafted and outside of 1 year has been slightly above average at best. 

Mcnabb did far more with far less on offense for a lot more years."
Wasteland,"Only real issue I’ve experienced is the game closing when I’m messing with inventory sometimes and just randomly closing. 

Is this addressed on Xbox one a? I’m at work and can’t see the notes."
DissidiaFFOO,i am new and feel awful because i am probably annoying people. i just press x ability because more numbers.
DissidiaFFOO,"haven't gotten to that point yet, so don't know what that is. I can't even get ifrit to 10 yet to unlock the bingo."
DissidiaFFOO,"even though you get the characters, they're kinda worthless since you don't get their gear though right?"
DissidiaFFOO,"well that makes sense on the cecil issue. 

Chapter 8, make vanille an ally, make setzer an ally."
DissidiaFFOO,"Only about a week into the game. I got noctis and all his cp weapons but wasn't lucky enough to get the tokens or 90 cp weapon for cecil ( have 15, 30, 75). 

Do i bench cecil until i am able to get the weapon again? 

Right now, i just finished chapter 7 of the main story. My noctis is just soloing everything with his aoe's and nothing has really challenged me that much. However, I can't activate chapter 8 because i am missing two characters and the game doesn't tell me where to find them. 

Are there any suggested comps built around noctis? Since he's my only character worth anything, I am a little confused still on who does what, and this game doesn't seem to have an easy to read character graph of what they do.

Is there a guide on what I am supposed to do with artifacts? I tried some co-op and got tons of artifacts but have absolutely no idea what they do. Do i limit, them and they provide a passive buff to the unit on the portrait of the card?

On the noctis banner, i got the mostly fang stuff for duplicates. I have 3 of her weapons limit broken, but was told she was kinda bad so I haven't used her. SHould i sell these off to limit break notcis' weapons or just hold off and keep them in case she's buffed and the power stones will come with time?

I have a ton more questions but don't want to overload anyone with them."
eagles,"im in my 40's , at this rate i'll be in my 80's by the time they win another. 

i think sanders was a bright spot today, minus the fumble, the dude is a great pick up, dg is a going to be a great tight end, and raegor seems like a good pick as well. Along with hurts , that's a future to build on.

there's really no urgency or heart on the team. doug will get through this year, but the team isn't on a level to compete even if they miraculously make the playoffs again for a 3rd straight year. We had no business being in there 2 years in a row and foles came in and one our last playoff game. 

They have issues top to bottom, from conditioning, to players, to coaching and i think with the 4 i listed above it may be time to think about some drastic changes if we stink it up the rest of the year. 

i see 7-9 as the ceiling of this team, and honestly that's pretty much what we've been since the superbowl."
eagles,"they're just not a good football team and I don't think the vikings failing,  a double doink or bad all around divisional play will mask it 3 years in a row for the eagles."
eagles,They’re not a good football team .
eagles,Djax shoulda been starting and getting more looks both games. Only wr out there that can play.
eagles,"Cause he was having an mvp season that 1 year and the other 4 , now, are someone else’s fault"
eagles,Double coverage throw while driving to have a chance at a come back. Who’s fault is it this week? Another bad throw that will probably cost the game.
eagles,They just aren’t enjoyable to watch. They look heartless out there.
DissidiaFFOO,"Question on auto, my units never use anything outside of default brv and hp attack? is that normal?"
DissidiaFFOO,i got a ton of fang weapons in this pull like 3 15's and 2 35's. do i use those to limit break them or sell them?
DissidiaFFOO,"reading the guide, the power stones are 1 per week and 4 per limit break? So, it'll take a 16 weeks to upgrade 1 weapon?"
DissidiaFFOO,"i got his 15, 35, 70, and 90. not much luck on cecil though"
DissidiaFFOO,"got it, i pulled on that and got a a few copies of the  15 and 35 cp weapons and one of the 90cp one for noctis"
DissidiaFFOO,"that's good to know, and thank you. what banner is the one i should pull on for the weapon? I have nine, noctis, and paladin and not sure which banner is the correct one."
DissidiaFFOO,thank you. this may be a stupid question but are there any farming characters? like aoe type characters?
DissidiaFFOO,"good to know, i thought i was done pulling the 15cp weapons . there's 5 banners and since i am learning what is the title of the banner i should pull on?"
DissidiaFFOO,"I am only a couple days in but enjoying the game so far. I was having some problems and realized instead of moving on to chapter 2 i did some super hard side chapter, when i got back on track i was way over geared for everything. 

I am not really pulling on much, i used the free tickets and got noctis and cecil (paladin) cp 15 weapons. 

I am currently using squall, cecil, and noctis.

The gacha mechanics on weapons are still a little unclear to me. is there anything i should be pulling on right now? think I have around 50k crystals/shards or w/e they are called."
DissidiaFFOO,"awesome thank you, i love the game but it's really confusing the heck out of me. I made it to chapter two and got wrecked on a sidequest so, trying to just find some simple stuff for me to understand and get going with."
DissidiaFFOO,"> Tonberrytroupe.com

thanks, i'll be reading this for a few days. I am just using the squall, cloud that i got off the beginner pull. Are they worth investing in or does it not matter?"
DissidiaFFOO,"i just grabbed this a day ago, and it's really been addictive but also overwhelming. is there an up to date new player guide? or are the older ones still relevant to current content?"
EpicSeven,"good to know, I am glad I invested her now. Even if she's banned if someone picks ssb it gives me a chance to use her as a forced ban which is a nice psychological advantage to have. thank you."
wotv_ffbe,"oh, didn't know that. thanks, i'll try to wrap up the story tonight."
wotv_ffbe,"so far i've gotten around 40k vis i estimate. i used one bundle on the anniversary event. Everything else has been pulled from what's been given to me. So still sitting at around 30k vis. I've bought the shards as they appear for SR's i use, or may use in the future."
EpicSeven,"great thanks, i was keeping her around 175 speed with 14k hp. I can probably get some more hp/er/def out of that and remove some speed. 

I'll pop her on my gw def team and see, but will definitely use her on offense against ssb. I am getting to a point where i can actually select units to counter where before i had only certain units geared to even attempt to fight and had to be restrictive on who i challenged.

how is roana in rta?"
wotv_ffbe,"I am only about a week in so far. Have pulled a crapton of UR's , gilgamesh, rain, etc.. over the past couple days.

I am currently using a party of mont, mediena, lu'cia, and shadowlynx. 

I've noticed that I am basically stuck on resource farming these units now. The only way i see getting this is randomly through the shop or 1-5 at a time through their respective story mission, correct?

Is this the grindwall? Upgrading units? Some of this seems like it'll take 6months just to upgrade my starting team.

I really enjoy the character art, and the overall activities in the game but the past day or so i find myself seeing this game less tactical and the animations extremely limited. The enemies don't have much variety through the story either, doing a final fight with the same enemy units just seemed pretty anti-climatic. Does this change? is there some more aesthetics outside of the big purple shard and simple auto attack animations? Does the game become more ""tactical"" in end game. I've literally just grabbed a 99 friend, and auto'd everything so far."
EpicSeven,"was getting bored holding onto 5* fodders for six starring and decided to six star a few heroes. One of those was my recently acquired roana. I slapped on a speed set with some health , awakened, and mola'd her s2 and s3. My arena defense went from 20% to 65% with roana, ssb, charles, lilia . 

I'd like to use her for as much as i can, she's my favorite hero in the game now. Should i just keep pumping, speed, health, and effective resist into her? Is she useful in any pve, if so what? Can i use her effectively in gw defense, offense?"

eagles,"I’m honestly just not excited. They looked the same today as the past 2 years, average. Only reason we got into the playoffs was other people choking harder than us. 

They’re reminding me of a chip kelly team but slow."
eagles,"I want to rag on wentz but I don’t need to, this really is who he is outside of one year."
eagles,"3 timeouts left, give em the field goal position. Gg."
eagles,What’s even more sad is we are one of the worst in salary cap and fielding this lineup
eagles,"This isn’t a good football team top to bottom. Secondary is improved but outside of that they look just like last year but slightly worse on offense. I’d like to not count on other teams sucking to make it to the playoffs but if this is a sign of things to come, we should all be a little concerned."
eagles,Obviously the duck trick isn’t working wentz
eagles,Wentz looked so good for the first few series but the game is going to be lost on him.
eagles,"Only reason this game is close is because of wentz.

And the only reason we are winning."
eagles,"I grabbed him late, gonna start next week."
eagles,Regret drafting djax already
eagles,Should I start him on my fantasy teams my flex? Have cole Beasley in there now.
eagles,I’m looking at it the same way. 6-2 fantastic and 5-3 a very good possibility.
wotv_ffbe,"Being so new, I don’t know if I could even get her to lb 3/4 so I guess I’ll pass and wait until/if the event returns."
wotv_ffbe,"Thanks, I’m probably too new to even have the resources and I’d waste all the vis on a character I may be unable to use. Sucks, really wish I’d started a few weeks ago. Thanks for the details though, saved a risk I probably should take this early in the game."
wotv_ffbe,im only about 3 days into the game and agrias is one of my favorite characters is there any way to get her and all the shards etc? I don't want to be able to only half ass her progression.
wotv_ffbe,"Another question, I've told not to waste the visiore i am getting on summons this early, so i've just been hoarding it. Over 20k now, what and when will i need to start using this on?"
wotv_ffbe,good stuff thanks. Can you have multiple formations?
wotv_ffbe,ahh awesome. when you select the job does leveling it give you new abilities? All my jobs are at level 1 except shadowlynx. I've learned enough from these games to not use resources unless i have a total understanding of what they are and how rare they are.
wotv_ffbe,"couple days in now.

I have shadowlynx at around level 60 trying to do the challenges and what not. The game isn't coming to me much faster, because I am left with more questions after each answer through the tutorials.

I noticed i unlocked jobs, but also haven't invested any points in abilities or job enhancing outside of just doing it for missions. There's a ton of abilities, and i guess the big concern i have is screwing that up. can i screw that up or do you just get all the abilities anyways? Second, and more specific, what should i be focusing on ability wise for shadowlynx?

I am running mont, frederika, lu'cia, miranda, and of course shadowlynx. are there suggested abilities? Is this a solid starting team?

I also have for UR's - sterne leonis, rain, oldoa, robb hourne, kitone, whisper, aileen, macherie, .

Are there better MR's to include in my team? I have:

gaffgarion, lilyth, schuzelt, margritte, khury, seymore, fina, dario, grace, rairyuu, vistralle, helena, ramada, lorenzo.

thanks."
wotv_ffbe,"wow, thanks. The paid vs normal makes sense now. am at work so didn't get a chance to jump and see the difference. It all makes sense though. I appreciate the thought out responses."
wotv_ffbe,"new player, these are in the new player shop with 4 or 5 days remaining. should i purchase all this stuff or not?

wotv_ffbe,"it's stuff like guaranteed UR for 60 vis, and 10 summons for 60 vis, stuff like that. I can take a screen shot if you wouldn't mind taking a look at it."
politics,"it's unfortunate. my wife is a republican and she's having a lot of struggle with things lately. The first thing she asked me was if this was ""real"", and I said yup they're tapes of trump. She goes into , ""was he serious? or trolling"". I sent her the link and haven't heard back. 

The fear of what the left could do is enough to dismiss just about anything. This pandemic has impacted my household just as much as millions of others, and him downplaying it may be what swings my wife away from voting for him. I would never tell her who to vote for , and she definitely won't vote on the dem ticket (the tim pools of the world have scared her away from that) but she may not vote at all now."
politics,"sure, regulators resigned. Emergency orders were issued, officials testified. criminal charges were filed, lawsuits, etc.."
politics,"Imagine this virus was isolated to one city in the US. Think what would happen if these comments were released on the mayor of that city and what would be expected of them to do (resign). 

I honestly just don't understand how someone can support this type of behavior. It shouldn't be about dems or republicans, the right's fear of what the dems could do being elected is blinding from the things trump is doing."
wotv_ffbe,"New player, only a day or so in. I am plugging away on the story and not really doing anything else. Not sure how i did on my rolls but i am kinda stuck since i linked my account. playing on my ipad.

UR: Marcherie Hourne, Sterne Leonis, Oldoa, Miranda, Whisper, Frederika, Lu'Cia, Robb Hourne, Kitone, Aileen. 

I haven't used any of my visiore, just the free 15 summons i got, and i think the one UR ticket.

Any suggestions on the starting team? I am not sure on which mr's to use or sr's if any but UR's seem to be the hot sauce talk. Is there anything i should pull on banner wise? Not sure which each banner does either. As a fft fan i am devastated i came right as agrias is leaving :( but hopefully I will have another shot at it in the future.

also, do any of you have any recommendations on youtubers that spell out everything for a beginner. A lot of terms and stuff are a little overwhelming. I play epic 7 a lot and one thing i am doing is holding on to just about every resource that appears rare until i have a better foothold on the game.

edit: should i buy all the stuff in the beginner's shop? it expires in 4days."
wotv_ffbe,Trust me the rng and gear grind is nothing short of complete and total rage. Thanks for the heads up
wotv_ffbe,"i linked my google account when i started up.  would i kill myself to bad keeping with Lu'Cia and Shadowlynx to start? Also, thanks for the tips, looking up some beginner stuff now, it's all a little overwhelming right now."
wotv_ffbe,"i pulled lu'cia from the guaranteed UR ticket just now, my mr's that i pulled when i first installed were shadowlynx and lorenzo."
wotv_ffbe,"I happened to come across this looking for a tactical game to play. Looking at guides and info on re-rolling and what not I came across a thread that stated this game is not new player friendly? Is this a consensus in the community? My first free rolls didn't include any Ultra rares, only 2 mega rares, is it advised to re-roll? How do i do it in this game? I play epic 7 a bit and it's pretty easy to re-roll there.

thanks."
EpicSeven,"Pulled roana, sez, broman, and some dupe 4 str artifacts as well as my 900th schuri"
Wasteland,"I decided to give the game a whirl after seeing it on gamepass. I honestly loved it until I started getting crashes . I really don’t think I should have to remember to save the game before I open my inventory every time.

It’s a shame because I really never experienced a game like this and I want to enjoy it but it’s just a technical disaster."
EpicSeven,"Pulled roana from event summons, is she worth building? If so, assuming speed and health?"
EpicSeven,"Tg, Alexa, ssb, crozet. 

Pvp , iseria, tama, bbk, ssb"
EpicSeven,"No, and that’s kinda like the story of my epic 7 life.

Have a. Lots but not cdomi, have a solid wyvern team but missing gpurgis and sigret.

I have a lot of heroes but I’m missing the one that’s gets me past gear restrictions."
stopsmoking,"Congrats , just hit 1500 days . Figured I’d congratulate you, and sharing my accomplishment. 25 years of smoking for me."
eagles,"one of my favorite games was mcnabb throwing 4 td's on a broken foot against the cards, they were playing the kryptonite song. might have been the year after they went to the west though."
EpicSeven,"the mola is worth about half it alone i think in terms of value. I have only pulled 1 ml5 (sage baal) with my galaxy's so i don't find any value in anything summon related. 

The rest comes down to the materials, green stones, charms etc.. If you are doing good with materials (more still never hurts), and short on skystones, it may not be worth it. 

Depends on where you stand if an incredible unit came out next week, would you have enough to pity it, mola it? That's at least my thought process as a f2p"
EpicSeven,"have her on my alt account. I wish i had her on my main account, i love her for wyvern and she's fun hero. Not sure how good she is in 13, but she sped up my wyvern 11 runs with her EE."
EpicSeven,"while gearing up for end game , currently just auto'ing w11 what stat combinations do i hold onto? I think i am just looking for perfect rolls and even after crafting not getting them. I have probably trashed useful stuff after watching a stream last night of a guy saving every 3 speed item, upgrading it, and if it didn't get a certain roll trashing it.

Is there a guide on this anywhere?"
EpicSeven,"i can tell you this from someone breaking end game barrier, the thing i am missing is speed for arena, speed for w13, and speed for everything."
echoes,"i'll give that a whirl tonight, thanks for the tip."
echoes,"Wow, thanks for this. I’ve been doing it wrong on a fundamental level. That’s what I get for being an armor tanking domi drone boat in eve .

I’ll try all this tonight after work. Appreciate you taking the time to spell it all out for me."
EpicSeven,"Sigret and I don’t own her on my main account which stinks. 

I hate that my main account has the meta characters and the long term investment but my alt account has the characters I enjoy using. Sigret , luluca."
EpicSeven,"i use tama / iseria with bbk + ssb to cleave. i am at master now and restricted by gear (speed).

so, i am looking at who to six star while i farm raid/hunts mostly."
EpicSeven,"I am fine tuning my w13 ( can auto 12, and will be able to do 13) and would like to also begin hell raid and the other hunts. Suggestions on the best to use and upgrade?

I have 3 six star materials to use and 110 molas, so i can promote 3 to 6 star.

My current 6 stars not in my w13 team:


Lilias - Charles - Tama - BBK - ssb


5 Stars :


a momo - yufine - hyufine - vivian - iseria - rviolet - pavel - sage baal 


4 stars : 


Achates - singelica - fighter maya - a coli - watcher schuri - rose - armin - troublemaker crozet - wanderer silk - a lots.


Thanks."
EpicSeven,what would be good min speed for them?
EpicSeven,"a lot of w13 crozet builds are utilizing noble oath which i don't have. 

My current lineup is just not getting it done. I had wyvern 11 on auto farm with tama, crozet, karin, and ssb. 

I swapped out for alexa, tg, ssb, crozet to push forward but my crozet just isn't making it (23k hp, 1550def). 

I am thinking of swapping out tg for furious, and swapping to momo for tanking w13. I am pretty sure on what furious needs but what stats, artifact, and strategy do i use to get momo able to tank it. She's 5 star now, so assuming she needs 6? I have all her runes max'd and skills max'd as well."
