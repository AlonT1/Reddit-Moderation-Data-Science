politics,I'm just curious - can you explain to me [what you think is happening in this graph](https://i.imgur.com/Db1EzFa.png)? Is it belief that the number of deaths is fake? Or just that the number of projected deaths is 'overblown' and that excess deaths to this degree is worth the trade off?
politics,"If people getting their hair cut, going to a public gym or getting a beer at an indoor bar is going to continue the exponential growth of a virus that is going to probably kill one 9/11's worth of people per day for the next week, then public intervention is necessary. Small business owners are being harmed, and it is my hope that direct stimulus, tax rebate / forgiveness and other measures can tide them over through the winter. 

But simply letting people go about everything as normal, and letting the options the option be either kill small businesses or kill people thousands of people and overwhelm our healthcare system is a choice not worth thinking about - many small businesses would not survive the havoc that unimpeded pandemic growth will bring anyway."
politics,"> Section 230 is a funky little rule that encourages sites to both moderate what is posted and avoid being overly censorious. Before the law was passed, courts had found sites that did some moderation liable for the third-party content they chose to leave up. Since Section 230 protects sites from this liability, they’re free to moderate without worrying about what they let stand. But it also protects users from overmoderation for the same reason: If a website were liable for the posts of its users, it stands to reason that the site might be a lot more strict about what content it allows.
> 
> Trump has claimed the law enables tech companies to censor conservative voices online and has sought to repeal Section 230 in various ways. In the spring, for example, he signed an executive order that weakened the law, while Republicans have introduced legislation to repeal or rework it. On Thanksgiving, Trump tweeted that Section 230 should be “immediately terminated,” and a defense spending bill reportedly might be used as a vehicle for passing language to repeal Section 230.
> 
> Biden too has called for a repeal of Section 230. His complaint is not that companies do too much moderation, though, but that they don’t do enough, citing social media’s limited response to disinformation as the main problem. But according to Lewis, “A full repeal of Section 230 would be a huge blow to free expression online. If President-elect Biden’s goal is to increase moderation, then repealing Section 230 will not accomplish that or, at worst, it will increase moderation to the point that it is oppressive.”
> 
> Lewis said Section 230 could be reformed without harming free expression, such as by more clearly defining some of the law’s vague or ambiguous language, but without any actual details or plans from the Biden transition team, it’s hard to say if that’s what is being pursued.
> 
> “It is the foundational law enabling the development of the internet and it’s facilitated decades of economic growth, innovation, freedom of expression and global leadership,” said Tiffany Moore, the senior vice president of political and industry affairs for the Consumer Technology Association. “Both sides have their concerns about Section 230, but we need a thoughtful, substantive conversation about Section 230, and ultimately that resides in Congress.”"
politics,"> The person to be deposed (questioned) at a deposition, known as the deponent, is usually notified to appear at the appropriate time and place by means of a subpoena. Frequently the most desired witness (the deponent) is an opposite party to the action. In that instance, legal notice may be given to that person's attorney, and a subpoena is not required. But, if the witness is not a party to the lawsuit (a third party) or is reluctant to testify, then a subpoena must be served on that party."

politics,Yes.
MechanicalKeyboards,"Okay I was trying to hold out but I'm not sure I can delay any longer -

I was looking at a Ducky One 2 with brown switches, and a Vortex Tab 90M - neither of which I can find shipping *today* - and I have a failed keyboard that I need for work."
politics,"> All other Senate races hewed quite close to presidential results — and because this year’s Senate races took place largely on Republican turf, that was a big blow to Democrats’ efforts to flip the chamber. Before Election Day, Democrats were hopeful that strong candidates like Steve Bullock, Jaime Harrison and Barbara Bollier could swim against the partisan tide and pull out wins in Montana, South Carolina and Kansas, respectively. But for all the money they raised, for all of their theoretical crossover appeal, Bullock ran just 4.6 points ahead of Biden, Harrison just 0.8 points ahead and Bollier just 0.3 points ahead. As a result, none came particularly close to winning their very red states.
> 
> To make matters worse for Democrats, their candidates also underperformed Biden in states where running slightly ahead of him might have been enough to flip a Senate seat or two. Maine is certainly an obvious example, but this category also includes states like Texas, where Democratic Senate candidate M.J. Hegar ran 2.6 points behind the president-elect (perhaps because her opponent, Sen. John Cornyn, was more temperamentally palatable to suburban swing voters than Trump was), and North Carolina, where Democrat Cal Cunningham ran 1.6 points behind (perhaps due to his sexting scandal). And despite Biden winning Georgia with 49.5 percent of the vote, Democrat Jon Ossoff got just 47.9 percent in the regular Senate election, and Democrats in the special election combined for just 48.4 percent — problems Ossoff and Raphael Warnock will need to solve in next month’s runoffs."

politics,"> Both lost on Nov. 3, and their plights show that for lawmakers skillful enough to win seats in districts that lean toward the opposite party, there’s no foolproof strategy to repeat the feat. Loyalty to fellow partisans might yield more help from the party apparatus and from Democratic donors, but it opens up other political vulnerabilities. Tack to the center and an opponent will still hang your party affiliation around your neck.
> 
> For House Democrats looking to strengthen their position in Congress, consensus on how to govern and how to run for office is no closer, as they regroup for January with a majority that could be as small as four seats, and with at least nine colleagues departing at year’s end.
> 
> Both McAdams and Shalala are leaving convinced that the way forward for Democrats is the path they each chose as legislators. “I think that the caucus needs to decide if they want to be a pragmatic and effective majority that works with the Biden administration to move forward centrist policies, or do they want to be a loud and vocal minority?” says McAdams. “They will make that decision now and over the next two years, but it will be cemented in the 2022 election.”"

politics,Can you point to some competitive house races where the effective challenger to a Tea Party (or similar) incumbent was a more progressive / less moderate Democrat?
politics,">McCarthy’s lead did shrink in 2020. Votes are still being counted in his race, but currently he leads over Democrat Kim Mangone by 22 points. In 2018, McCarthy won by 27 points. In previous years, he won by 40 to 50 points, and sometimes more.
>
>But while the strategy of tying McCarthy to Trump probably helped the effort, the 2020 margin still isn’t enough to consider the district competitive, said Jeff Cummins, political science professor and interim dean of the College of Social Sciences at Fresno State University.
>
>“When we start seeing registrations and victory close to five percent, we consider it a competitive district,” Cummins said. “But in McCarthy’s case, while the margin has gone down, it’s still not anywhere near a competitive district.”

[...]

>But Janz and Danny Kedem, senior strategist for Voter Protection Project, say they’ve learned how to be more effective both in purple and deep red parts of the country: by continuing to show the GOP’s ties to Trump, even when he’s no longer in the White House.
>
>“The hangover of Donald Trump isn’t going to go away just because he’s no longer president,” Kedem said. “We helped build a multi-million organization for people who care about our democracy. We’re only going to continue to grow, and get louder and more prevalent as time goes on.”
>
>They also saw 2020 as a building year, they said. The pandemic prevented them from knocking on voters’ doors and holding big rallies, but now they have the groundwork laid out to beef up their operation further for 2022, when the pandemic has hopefully receded and more normal elections can take place."
politics,">With several races still uncalled, Speaker Nancy Pelosi could have a majority as narrow as 221-214, giving her three votes to spare when Republicans are united in opposition. Presuming Democrats elect her to return as their leader, Pelosi will have a monumental task in keeping the caucus together. The speaker’s job is all the more complicated because moderates are fearful that Democrats will lose seats in the 2022 midterm elections, considering Republicans have unified control of the process that will redraw district lines in more states than Democrats do.
>
>Progressive dreams of a sweeping, liberal agenda “will have to be tempered by the reality of this election,” said Rick Boucher, a former 14-term representative from southwest Virginia and member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition. Boucher lost his seat in the tea party wave of 2010.

[...]

>There’s no indication that Pelosi, who has already pledged to serve only through 2022 as speaker, has a challenger. Still, the moderates who opposed her and expressed their dissatisfaction with progressives’ policy ideas will want assurances that she’ll avoid them.
>
>Those include the Green New Deal, “Medicare for All,” defunding the police and anything that Republicans can label as socialism.
>
>The irony is that Pelosi avoided these issues during 2019 and 2020, but moderates are fearful that the party’s Progressive Caucus will push harder next year, especially if Democrats win Senate control.
>
>“Any move too far to the left jeopardizes those seats that make up her majority,” said Lisa Camooso Miller, a partner at Reset Public Affairs who was a spokeswoman for Illinois Republican Dennis Hastert when he was speaker.

This is an extremely detailed and in depth look at the position in the house, with lots of input from experts on likely trajectory of the majority, and lots of individual names and contenders referenced for theoretical leadership jockeying. I recommend the read."

politics,"I hope we didn't say anything like that - whatever domain you're remembering, we would never have made that a real consideration when talking about their eligibility for submission. 

There are very very unpopular domains that were on the available list that were later removed. Some reasons we removed those sites were:

* the mod team went back to question whether the notability criteria were being fully met by a domain
* the team felt that a domain was functioning as a blog platform rather than a publication 
* a domain was continuously publishing so much rule breaking content that it made them infeasible or undesirable to allow

Specifically I recall that Sean Hannity's personal site was one of the removals that users were happy about, and our problem with them was that on review, Hannity's radio show really was not accessible for submit - which was the notable eligible part of the publisher - and the remainder of the content was blog posts by participants in his personal forums. 

We really would not have removed a domain just because it was perceived negatively, that's not something we want to be part of our decision making process."
politics,"Voting is meant to control what rises to the top of the feed and what goes down - it isn't meant to decide who can participate and who can't. Polling the users on that kind of question isn't something we think should be part of our decision making process, sorry."
politics,"Twitter has been allowing the NY Post to link to stories about it after initially locking them. The model for sharing on Twitter and Reddit is very very different, and one of those differences is the availability of the downvote as a tool for the user. 

I understand why people feel how they do, but I continue to be confident that our approach is the best path for managing r/politics. If it's the ability of questionable media organizations to create questionable stories to begin with, the problem needs to be addressed at a different layer than web platforms themselves - what people need to ask is if this is grounds for changing the way our slander laws work, or if unfettered web media orgs will be better or worse with some kind of regulatory control. 

Plugging the hole in the dam with a finger in one subreddit isn't going to achieve what people want."
politics,"What people believe to be misinformation in the realm of politics can be subjective. When we talked through how we wanted to handle the move from a blacklist system to an approved URL system, we were adamant that we wanted to remain an open platform, where people would trust that content is being curated by user voting, rather than moderator decision.

The best way we came up with to reinforce that trust was to ensure that all content would be treated equally - if content met a set of notability guidelines, if content was having influence in the existing discourse that people were consuming, we wanted it to be eligible for user consideration. 

User voting can handle the rest."
politics,"We remove meta content from the Friday talk threads, so this isn't going to do anything.

* downvoting content this is inappropriate or substandard 
* making comments explaining issues with posted content"
politics,"That is not the reason that the Epoch Times was removed.

>Opening those gates led to big jumps in output (8,000 posts per month!) and in traffic (nearly tripling pageviews between 2011 and 2014). It pumped some life into a declining brand and made it possible for the company to sell a majority share to a Hong Kong investment company in 2014 at a whopping $475 million valuation. Impressive!
>
>The problem was that — just as your News Feed clogged up with junky memes, clickbait headlines, and your uncle’s crazy rants, all produced at no cost to Facebook — it was impossible to maintain quality with that much of an open-door policy. A once-esteemed publication took on the vague scent of grift: articles that looked suspiciously like press releases, writers with unknown loyalties, and just a general ick about the whole endeavor.
>
>We now know — well, we always knew; now we have one more piece of evidence — what that sort of an arrangement can lead to. As The New York Times first reported briefly a week ago and then at more length Sunday, the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein used Forbes’ open door to whitewash his reputation after his stint in a Florida jail.
>
>A 2013 article “by” Forbes contributor Drew Hendricks made Epstein look like a science superhero, “the financial guru” who “has become one of the largest backers of cutting-edge science around the world,” donating “up to $200 million a year to eminent scientists,” “motivated by learning more about the mind, versus creating a new start-up product.”"
politics,"That is an interesting perspective on the article's tone and assumptions regarding his standing - one which I upvoted.

This means we can't use automoderator to simply remove the 'contributor' articles - which again, are effectively blogs without editorial oversight, due to the fact that almost anyone can apply to have a Forbes contributor column on their platform - while leaving the staff articles in tact. Faced with having to review every single Forbes article to see if was staff written or not, and finding that the vast majority of Forbes submissions were contributor platform articles, we had little choice but to block them entirely as a blog platform site.

If - as in this thread- there is a notable *Forbes staff written* exclusive, we can take a quick active mod vote to override the removal and approve the submission."

politics,"I think the article kind of addresses some of the reasons why Twitter's attempt at intervention was counter productive

>It’s not publicly known what process exactly led to the rapid change and which groups or individuals were consulted. But in a late night tweet thread, Twitter Legal, Policy and Trust & Safety lead Vijaya Gadde admitted the company had failed to update its 2018 protocols around how to handle hacked materials due to a sort of oversight. The original policy triggered removal of content, but the company had more recently “added new product capabilities, such as labels to provide people with additional context.” The company had simply neglected to revisit the old policy with the newer and more expansive techniques for addressing malignant content. On some level this kind of response shows Twitter is still treating this like a software problem — a defined conditional statement to be executed uniformly. 

We're a couple weeks out from the election - it's not what submissions are going to be burried at the bottom or r/politics/controversial that has me concerned about disinformation, and it probably shouldn't be the thing you're most concerned about either. The whitelist was implimented in the summer of 2017, and at no time since then has anyone demonstrated evidence that the list was making r/politics more of a vector for misinformation."
politics,"^*Edit: ^decided ^the ^final ^para ^is ^a ^better ^summary ^of ^the ^article's ^arguments*

>The furor over the New York Post story is in part a problem of the social platforms’ own making. While it is clearly “not censorship to slow the sharing of misinformation on networked services,” as Joan Donovan, Director of Harvard’s Shorenstein Center said. After a decade or more of taking a laissez-faire approach to content moderation, allowing lies, extremism and conspiracy theories to fester, many people are simply not habituated to the idea that social media companies may play such an explicit editorial role in deciding what content is allowed on platforms. Many of those who believe that social media has enabled the hyper-polarization that dominates American politics today may welcome a heavier hand in the moderation of false claims, but now is an extraordinary moment for these firms to suddenly assert themselves. The way in which these companies choose to act on their newfound concerns over the veracity of information pumping through their platforms will likely play a crucial role in determining whether that polarization declines after the election, or whether it is inflamed. Time is short to set up systems that handle these matters appropriately."

Against_Astroturfing,"I'm a little curious how you feel about the situation. In my opinion, Giuliani was tasked with finding dirt on Biden, and when he could only find the one lead - the Hunter Biden narrative - he grabbed on and refused to let to, to the point of letting conmen, grifters and even likely foreign intelligence assets lead him on. 

The story about this laptop sounds for obvious reason, outrageously suspicious to me. 

I'm not sure what Twitter and Facebook should be doing here - I think at best they slowed the 'manual' spread of this story for a half a day, and now it's gonna be blasted from the president's accounts for the next week at least. But the story is, to put it in mild terms, suspect."

Digital_Manipulation,"Ask yourself why the halt in activity is enough to make this """"theory"""" viable."
Digital_Manipulation,No they weren't this is incredibly silly. I just cannot understand how people are this gullible.
politics,"We have a huge array of sources on the domain list - and the entire ideological spectrum is covered, with hundreds and hundreds of sources falling somewhere on the left edge of the compass.

The left is not a MLM scheme in this scenario - a site that was participating using employees who were using a third person voice to talk about themselves, were asked not to, then kept doing it. The action against this particular site had nothing to do with left or right - it had to do with their ability to abide by the rules that we had set, and the behavior that we had discussed with them before we took action."
politics,">Based on some observations early on, for instance, I believe that comments using the loud, shouty ""#Header 1"" style tend to be invisible to anyone other than the user making the comment.

That along with excessive **bold** text is a fairly normal automoderator filter used after a rash of users making everything #large to spam and grab attention.

Our in house bot does additional specialized  toxicity / incivility targeting."
politics,"[There has been some study of this](https://civilservant.io/moderation_experiment_r_science_rule_posting.html) and the evidence suggests that rules sticky may result in slightly more rule compliance. Even if the gain is a very small percentage, *anything* at the sheer scale of comments we look at is worth it for us."
politics,"> Have you considered implementing something like the r/worldnews ""reporters""? Basically selected users with the ability to remove individual comments that violate the rules but no access to modmail, etc. 

Yes we have, and we have not ruled it out. Mainly I think finding the time to plan out how we would implement this in our community was the main barrier the last time this suggestion was brought up - we'd want some customization to the workflow they use, and it requires a lot of careful thought in terms of how it would interact with our comment rules and how we would maintain enough oversight to ensure enforcement was consistent.

EDIT: Note that we have always had at least one r/worldnews mod on the team for the past... long long time."
politics,"I know, I was just hoping that isentrope would remember that anniversary, since he managed to forget my birthday and all. But it's fine I'm not mad."
politics,"Not remembering the month and the week that I put the whitelist announcement up, smh..."
politics,"Imagine you're holding a big party. Your friends show up. Their friends show up. Your asshole cousin who never shuts the hell up about the gold standard and auditing the federal reserve shows up. Your friend's girlfriend who is always talking about her church group shows up. You've got a lot of people - lots of people you like, lots of people you don't like. 

A guy shows up and starts running up to every single guest to try and get them to talk about their MLM pyramid scheme. You're having a party, not a sales conference, so you walk up to them and tell them that they really can't be hawking their homeopathic medicine if they want to stay. They nod and agree - no problem. 

You leave for 30 minutes and come back and the same guy is back at it, hawking his medicinal boner pills or whatever, only he's put on a different jacket and sunglasses to try and hide from you. So take him to the door and show him out.

That is the best analogy I can make for why Shareblue is banned, but the controversial domains referenced above are not."
politics,"Curious what other mods would have to say about this. From my own perspective, less - at least in our community."
politics,"> Do you guys think that those publications and conservative think tanks have realized that there's not much use in having interns and low level staffer spam those links anymore or something?
> 
> 

I think the users / persons that took a lot of satisfaction out of stirring people's emotions with those submissions have found a lower return on investment in terms of the effort it takes to the mental reward they were receiving. 

I think it's good for me and for r/politics users generally to get a good sense of what voices on all sides of discussion are saying and talking about - but in terms of whether I miss some of our more dedicated shit posters:

No I can't say I'm bummed about their lowered activity. Hopefully we're not jinxing ourselves."
politics,"> The distinction between opinion pieces and actual news gets lost on so many people, this maybe be not only beneficial, but also a teaching moment.

Agreed."
politics,">~~Un~~fortunately reddit does not give us access to IP addresses. 

Gentle reminder that there are absolutely no barriers in creating a reddit community or being a reddit moderator on this site - I don't want the coyboys over at places like r/worldnews having my IP data, and you probably wouldn't appreciate us having yours. Reddit is a site designed around anonymity for all the good and all the bad that entails."
politics,"We do have a tool that highlights comments from new accounts in our own workflow, so that we can identify new account spammers and trolls more quickly. I think it would be excessive to put a user flair on every relatively new commenter."
politics,"Linking to candidate sites is generally not a problem - position pages or press releases in particular are desirable comment content. But we frown on links to donation pages or other forms of solicitation, and will issue bans hastily if we notice someone posting links to such pages multiple times / across multiple threads."
politics,"Other large news subreddits focus on creating a space free of editorial / opinion content, but for a US politics focused sub, the subject matter is intrinsically going to be about the debate and battle of ideas surrounding the issues; we feel that opinion and editorial content is a huge part of what politics is going to be about. 

The majority of the mod team likes the idea of opinion flair / tags in theory - we've been arguing for years about ways that we could do this which wouldn't be abused and wouldn't generate an unsustainable amount of work for us. We'd still like to try and make that work at some point, but we haven't found a consensus on any method as of now, and we're not going to be making any huge changes of that nature until the election season concludes."
politics,"We have our in house bot doing a lot more things by this point than we did during 2016 - it does more precise duplication detection, it does some specialized comment filtering that it wasn't doing at all back then, we're collecting more data and highlighting excessive reports to our attention.

In terms of automoderator, we've continued to expand our library of 'user insult' related targeting, added the domain approval system in 2017 (which is a huge, fundamental change to the way that the submission moderation functions) and overall have more comment / user volume. 

Our automoderator and third party automation was already quite sophisticated in 2016 and overall it has only gotten even more powerful and precise - it can't be stated enough how important and helpful our bot authors/developers and maintainers are to the subreddit. They are heroes."
politics,">  could be people that have been banned and just created new accounts

In our experience this makes up the overwhelming majority of malicious new user activity. 

I think it's better to look for other indicators of malicious activity than user age alone - and looking for multiple signals of malicious / bad faith behavior at once has proved among the more successful. That's the approach I prefer we continue to explore."
politics,"Personally I'm fairly comfortable with where our mixture of age gate protocols are set at present and don't feel like we require a major change, certainly not in the direction of more restriction. I'd rather look for more precise ways to highlight *bad* behavior from new accounts for us to action, than to ramp up the amount of blanket restrictions we're adding. It's better for us to try and target rule breaking or malicious behavior directly than to try to set up broad barriers to entry."
politics,"I think it's reasonable to expect that the time that people might want to make their first comment in r/politics would be at the height of the US political season, and I'm not willing to blanket exclude those potential users with the argument that getting here before they did makes us more worthy to participate than they are."
politics,"We do keep a running list of [AMA marked threads here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/ama) but I don't think we've ever done a list of Megathread marked submissions.

However, during one of our bot updates we did start uniformly tagging Megathreads with a flair - using the reddit flair search should let you see everything that's Mega'd, and should let you sort by submitted time: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/?f=flair_name%3A%22Megathread%22

The same can be done for special discussion/event threads: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22"
politics,"We have a number of age gate mechanisms in place that were introduced piecemeal over the past several years - these cut down on ban evasion and drive by trolling substantially. 

But we don't feel like it would be right to block all new user activity outright - every single user on reddit, you and I included, had to make our first comment sometime, and we should be trying to make it welcoming for genuine new users now - at the height of interest in the topic - more than ever."
politics,"I used about 2 tablespoons of peanut butter to a rounded teaspoon of preserves. If the bread I'm using is sturdy enough to mostly clean the knife with a final swipe along the edge, I'll just use the knife. Usually I switch to a spoon for spreading the jelly/preserves."
malefashionadvice,"I don't think you need to be ashamed of liking the Thursdays IMHO. There have been a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/iyhpae/thursday_boots_captain_arizona_adobe_x2_review/) of [relatively](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/it9hn1/thursday_boots_captain_in_brown_12ish_month_review/g5cubw0/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) recent [reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/iobrz9/6_month_review_thursday_boot_company_captains_in/) on GYW that were largely favorable. I don't think it's a matter of them being 'low quality' - they're using a tried construction method, and yes they are using an EVA sole, but that works for a lot of people for quite a long while. The two brands recommended by smockled are probably among the most comparable in that price bracket in the US.

There are a few reasons that one might prefer alternatives including Red Wing, but I honestly think a large amount of the hate levied at Thursday is mainly about justifying more expensive purchases to people who have invested in their own collection."
politics,"We receive many thousands of reports per day, and we do our best to enforce our rules objectively using these reports. I can say that I've issued many bans to people presenting from all ideological perspectives."
politics,"If FLOTUS wrote that as a comment on a post about someone's illness, death or harm, yes it would result in a ban."
politics,"> Based on this subs unwritten rules, we're allowed to be indifferent and even celebrate the great job Trump did killing all of those people in order to allow his rich cronies to harvest profit from misery but we're not allowed to even hint that he did this to himself and America would be a much much better place had Fred Trump never gotten off the fucking boat.

Without much commentary, I just want to clarify the rule exactly as it is written in our comment guidelines:

>Do not threaten, advocate for, celebrate, or express extreme indifference towards any kind of action that results in or could result in death or harm (physical or otherwise). This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this behavior may be subject to a permanent subreddit ban."

politics,"Good afternoon -

The Biden campaign has made some signals as to how they want to strengthen our national cyber security infrastructure. One subject I'm not sure I've seen a statement on is civilian access to encrypted services - leaders at the FBI, and the current AG Bill Barr have signalled that they want US companies to weaken their encryption, or else provide 'back door' access for law enforcement:

>″[T] here have been enough dogmatic pronouncements that lawful access simply cannot be done,” Barr said. “It can be, and it must be.”

There are substantial concerns from technologists that such law enforcement access cannot be granted in a way that will not fundamentally weaken or break security. Does the Biden campaign have a position on how they would direct the DoJ / FBI regarding civilian encryption? Would a Biden administration continue to lobby for special law enforcement access to privately encrypted systems?"

politics,"> In Lackawanna County, registered Democrats have historically outnumbered Republicans three to one, but, over the past several years, the margin has dwindled to two to one, according to Chris Patrick, the local Democratic chair. “To see this flip in this area is extraordinary,” Christopher Borick, a political analyst at Muhlenberg College, in Allentown, told me. Many of the defectors are white voters without college educations. “Even before 2016, you have lifelong white working-class voters in both northeastern and southwestern Pennsylvania who have a ‘D’ on their registration but have been voting for Republicans,” Borick said. Catholic voters in the region are also leaving the Democratic Party, largely because of the Party’s increasingly liberal stance on reproductive rights. “Now you’ve got an Irish Catholic Presidential candidate struggling to win his own town and his own county,” Borick said. (He thought that the recent death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the possibility that a Trump appointee would move to restrict abortion access, might cause more Catholics to defect, though it might also motivate Democratic turnout. “For those voters concerned above all with reproductive rights on both sides, it’s probably a reinforcing issue,” he said.) Cognetti, the Scranton mayor, told me that residents have also become more skeptical of institutions and more sympathetic to Trump’s self-presentation as an outsider. “Basically, every institution of authority in Pennsylvania has let people down in some way in the last decade,” she said. “The sex scandals at Penn State and in the Catholic Church, along with elected officials all over the state going to jail. The absolute crumbling of trust in authority is real, and that can’t be ignored.”
> 
> In 2016, the Republican Party noticed that many of these voters, even those who remained registered as Democrats, voted for Trump in large numbers. After the election, the Party began an intensive outreach program, involving canvassing, mailers, and targeted advertising. “We have seen, over time, the Republican ground game be more effective in Pennsylvania,” Borick told me, and this has resulted in an uptick in Republican registrations. Registration is a Party’s most powerful tool, Borick added: the G.O.P. will now be able to remain in touch with these newly registered voters in the lead-up to the election, coördinate getting them to polling stations, and encourage them to vote for down-ballot Republicans. Local Party leaders also hope that, more subjectively, the registrations will shift residents’ political identity, encouraging them to think of themselves not as independent-minded Democrats but as Republicans, and thus cementing their loyalty in the long term.

politics,">But perhaps the surest sign that a state won’t be called on election night is if it accepts mail ballots that arrive after Election Day. By definition, any results these states release on election night will be incomplete because at least some ballots — and probably quite a few — will still be in transit. And with the recent developments in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, that means a majority of presidential swing states now fall into this category (at least for now).
>
>Right now, it looks like our best chance of getting a call on election night in a major swing state is in Florida. In addition to not accepting ballots that arrive after Election Day, the Sunshine State begins processing mail ballots several weeks early, enabling them to release results extremely quickly on election night. On paper, Arizona also looks like it could be called on election night, although it doesn’t have a good track record of fast counting: In 2018, it took almost a week to declare a winner in some close races there.
>
>But it looks increasingly unlikely that we’ll be able to declare an election-night winner in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In addition to possibly having thousands of ballots still in transit on election night, these states will probably be slow to count even the mail ballots that have already arrived, since all three prohibit processing mail ballots before Election Day. (By contrast, North Carolina is allowed to process mail ballots well in advance, so we should learn the results of mail ballots that arrive by Nov. 2 shortly after polls close — but then have to wait days for the remainder.)"

The analysis identified hundreds of lawsuits against Justice companies, including dozens brought by workers, vendors, business partners and government agencies, all alleging they weren’t paid.

>As Fast Company originally reported, there is no law and previously was no Facebook policy to stop the Trump campaign, or any other political campaign, from falsely claiming victory through millions of ads starting at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time on election night.
>
>The policy change is an update to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s September 3 blog post, in which the CEO said that his company would not publish political ads in the week before the election because there wouldn’t be enough time before Election Day to fact-check their claims. When Fast Company reached out, however, the company confirmed that political campaigns would be able to place new ads on Facebook starting November 4.

TheRecordCorrected,They can't copy and paste content hundreds of times in order to artificially amplify their message. Nor do I think it's ethical to pay dozens or hundreds of people a salary to use their personal profiles without disclosing their affiliation or employment. Isn't that the kind of behavior that the people of this subreddit - myself included - found offensive to begin with?
TheRecordCorrected,"There was never a shred of evidence that CTR paid people to mass post on social media. The closest to evidence that has ever been presented regarding similar Democrat led efforts is [this article regarding an operative doing automated Twitter posting](https://shareblueastroturf.netlify.app)- but that case pales in scale when compared with what is discussed in this article. 

And if what CTR was accused of doing in 2016 deserved an entire subreddit of criticism, why should the same vitriol and disgust not be given towards what Turning Point is doing now?"
Against_Astroturfing,">The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA’s website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity.

>Those recruited to participate in the campaign were lifting the language from a shared online document, according to Noonan and other people familiar with the setup.

AgainstHateSubreddits,"You're right - since that change they were supposed to be on, my mistake. Before that you can see plenty of ads that displayed with no comments. 

That said, from the period at two months ago where there were some comment enabled ads, you can see some moderator removed comments which I presume, means site / admin removed - and I stand by that it is interesting to think about the conflict of interest that arises from letting them remove comments on behalf of the people paying them. 

>The simplest approach here would be to not allow political advertising at all.

Maybe. Only one major website has done that so far and there are good questions about what that means for the future - can companies advertise PR with political implications, where an advocacy group cannot? There's an asymmetry problem and I'm not sure it will always be as straight forward to just bar candidates and PACs when politics is a lot more far encompassing than those interests alone.


EDIT: The link to all the political ads that have been run on reddit through their tracking - https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/"
AgainstHateSubreddits,"There's some interesting meta to digest here but:

Political ads were already being purchased on reddit, and comments were not being enabled for them. Now reddit inc. is adding a comment hub to political ads - because one, reddit inc. doesn't want to pay to moderate any content but also, cause it's a conflict of interest for them to moderate the content for the people paying them for ad space. 

I think there's a valid question about how political ads on social media should work or even if they should be sold - but reddit's approach here is at least exhibiting a little creativity in that it allows for an outside party to add context and engage in some pushback."

Against_Astroturfing,"> As a mod of politics who posts about astroturfing, let me ask you this: do you think politics isn't being astroturfed and influenced/manipulated by interned or paid for posts/votes/comments?
> 
> 

I've been a moderator of r/politics for four years - in that time, people have suggested or argued hundreds, probably thousands of cases in which they believed someone to be a paid astroturfer or state backed actor. The number of cases in which I felt there was circumstantial evidence to indicate that there might be something to these individual claims is a tiny percent of the accusations - in the order of dozens, if I'm ball parking. The number of cases where there was very hard evidence to substantiate a claim lower still than that. And of the cases with 'merit', the majority of those cases involved media organizations or potential state actors.

I can think of a couple of cases where people with a conflict of interest - people who were potentially involved with or working for - a political organization (think: pollster, think tank, lobbying etc) were submitting their own content, and we dealt with those cases appropriately. A *couple*: that doesn't strike me as anywhere near the scale necessary for the direction of the community to be meaningfully altered or manipulated. 

On the subject of votes and comments: I can only act upon that which I can see. Moderators cannot see any more data about who is voting on submissions than a user can - all of my tacit experience on reddit and r/politics leaves me with a high level of confidence that things are voted on by 'normal' users. My experience working with the reddit platform indicates that true vote manipulation is a non-trivial undertaking: yes, there are confirmed cases of people vote manipulating the reddit platform, but reddit's anti-spam / manipulation mechanics do a ton of things behind the scenes that you and I will never witness with our eyes, and the fact that a manipulator / attacker can't get a ton of data about how and when their attempts are working or being foiled makes investing time in that process a tedious and for a political or state actor, risky proposition. 

Risk, in that the threat of discovery or outing is likely to have a disproportionate level of harm to their employer or client to the gain that could potentially be achieved. Every day I **do** see attempts at 'manipulation' - attempts from spammers and SEO black hats and other profit motivated actors. And the reason I think that these actors - profit motivated ones - are visible and undeterred by the threat of discovery, is that there is only upside if they succeed. If they fail the only lose their time and the accounts they created or obtained. For political or state actors, the math is very different - discovery could do irreparable harm to their reputation, or to the reputation of their organization/employer.

In short: I cannot know with 100% certainty whether there are political influences trying at or succeeding at manipulating r/politics. I **do** know I *haven't* seen much evidence I can speak to - despite looking at many *many* reports, and spending a great deal of time looking at possible instances. And I think your time and mine is best spent talking about things which we **do** have evidence for. 

>Follow-up question (this has more to do with censorship): do you think mods there (over at politics) don't ever abuse their power/enforce rules arbitrarily, and or use automod to censor controversial words/phrases aka wrongthink?

The people who have volunteered to moderate r/politics are people by and large who want to, as much is as reasonable, make r/politics slightly more tolerable for discussion and less toxic than the way we may have found it when interacting as users. In terms of 'censorship', we spend a lot of time thinking about what reasonable 'rules of engagement' are when users interact with one another, and we often err on the side of removing comments that are mostly used to make personal attacks toward other users. You can make arguments for or against this mentality - overall, I think it improves the subreddit more than it harms open discourse. Some people disagree, and that's fine. For things within the realm of genuine political discussion, I think we are very conscientious about leaving room for debate and dissent in our discussion - sometimes more than what the plurality of our community sometimes claims they want. 

Moderation on reddit is an all volunteer effort. Getting 60 employees at an actual company or organization to be on the same page can be taxing at the best of times - doing it with faceless volunteers is a great deal more challenging. I think we do pretty well for the most part in terms of consistency - I'm biased I suppose, but from what I see in the 'meta sphere' of reddit, I think we do a better job than that of many large communities.  Do I think moderators could be letting their personal feelings impact the way they moderate? On less common edge cases - grey areas of rules, certain kinds of toxic behavior - maybe? But we have a lot of red tape and reviewing in our policies to reduce personal bias as much as can given our limited resources, limited time, and all volunteer force can allow. I'm not sure that a different mod team with the same constraints could do a lot better than what our team does - and if they think they can, they're welcome to create their own community. To people who dislike or disagree with r/politics policies I do often note that I invite and frankly would welcome more competition."

It is very clear that he acting as a diplomatic agent in this capacity, and that he is directly contradicting the policy of the acting diplomatic administration. 

>Why would the FBI interview Flynn when they knew he wasn’t a Russian asset?

I really don't see how this line of thinking could in anyway undo the facts:

* Flynn was under valid increased scrutiny due to his prior unregistered paid lobbying on behalf of Russian state media and Turkey.
* He had failed to officially disclose these payments more than once
* He acted as an official envoy, conveying direct policy actions that were undermining the legal administration's policy and authority
* He lied to law enforcement agents about the substance of that investigation"
PoliticalCompassMemes,">  phone call (which was 100% legal)

It's absolutely not legal for someone who is not a legal representative of the United States to represent the US in an official capacity, especially when they were directly undermining the acting legal representatives. 

Flynn was asked if he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. He absolutely did, and in fairly direct terms - and he opted to leave that out of his discussion with FBI investigators. If you want to stage a defense of that and argue about how he was absolutely correct go ahead."

No. The Foreign Agents Registration Act and the Logan act are clear. Representing / acting on behalf of the nation when you have no legal authority to do so is illegal."
PoliticalCompassMemes,"The ""Crossfire Hurricane"" DoJ / IC investigation into Russian election interference which included investigation of Michael Flynn was deemed justified [by Trump's own DoJ investigation, which was released under Barr's watch](https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf#page=393). Michael Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak at a Russian Federation [RT event in 2015](https://www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/325569-strategy-isis-terrorism-attacks/) (which [he failed to disclose](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-04-01/flynn-did-not-disclose-income-from-russian-companies-white-house)) - paid involvement with foreign state propaganda is cause enough to raise concerns about foreign interference. That appearance is cited in the DoJ assessment. 

He was a sketchy dude, doing sketchy things who couldn't keep his stories straight when talking with FBI investigators. There's no Obamagate - only Michael Flynn behaving like a corrupt partisan jackass."
PoliticalCompassMemes,"What about Flynn's consulting agency, which was paid to improve the public opinion of Turkey's president Erdogan? Who Flynn continued to lobby on behalf of through the presidential transition? 

In September of 2016, was his unregistered lobbying on behalf of Turkey and suggestion of illegal ex-filtration not worthy of law enforcement / intelligence attention?

>Flynn participates in a meeting with senior Turkish officials in which the group reportedly discusses the option of kidnapping the cleric Gulen and removing him from the United States, according to a Wall Street Journal story (published in March 2017). Alptekin invited Flynn to the meeting, according to Flynn’s firm, and Alptekin is present at the meeting. Woolsey, who was affiliated with Flynn’s firm at the time, was present for part of the meeting’s discussion,the contents of which he said greatly disturbed him. Woolsey thought the proposal for Gulen would “pretty clearly be a violation of law”  

The DoJ and US IC had more than enough justification to be concerned about Flynn's unethical and repeated flagrant violations of US law. Flynn is a grifter and a suck up. Seems like a waste of time centering the entire ""Obamagate"" propaganda operation around such a blatantly guilty individual."
Against_Astroturfing,Some interesting hints as to the resources that the major social media companies have devoted (or argue that they have devoted) to countering disinformation and state sponsored propaganda campaigns.
politics,">Unlike most presidential elections, when ballots are tallied and counted in a majority of precincts by midnight on Election Day and news outlets are able to project a winner before you go to bed, this November’s election is likely to be different. Because of a surge in mail-in ballots caused by people’s reluctance to physically go to the polls with COVID-19 still coursing through the population, results are likely to be delayed.

[...]

>“My concern is that … we don’t really have to use our imagination, but look at what has happened in the last few years on Russian disinformation campaigns, with the president welcoming it and expanding it,” Swalwell [D-Calif.] said in an interview. “I’m seeing a situation where the president does not concede defeat, challenges the results in courts, and Russian actors amplifying that on social media with fake news stories about mail-in ballots, and creating confusion about the legitimacy of results. That’s my fear.”

[...]

>[...] Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and a former Republican governor of Pennsylvania, has criticized Trump's comments on mail-in voting, as well.

>“I think it’s very sad and very disappointing that with almost five months to go, the president seems to [want to] try to delegitimize the November 3 election,” Ridge told National Public Radio last month. “It just seems to me that this may be an indication he’s more worried about the outcome than he's worried about fraud.”"

politics,">The slogan is unpopular with most demographic groups, too, with two notable exceptions: Black Americans and Democrats. In the two polls where results were broken down by race, Black respondents said they supported defunding the police by an average of 45 percent to 28 percent, while white respondents opposed it by an average of 61 percent to 23 percent. This is in line with other polls that have consistently shown that white people mostly see police in a favorable light, while Black people are likelier to have experienced mistreatment at officers’ hands and take the problem of police violence seriously. So what we’re seeing here may be another reflection of Black and white Americans’ different experiences with police.

[...]

>For instance, when Reuters/Ipsos queried people about “proposals to move some money currently going to police budgets into better officer training, local programs for homelessness, mental health assistance, and domestic violence,” a whopping 76 percent of people who were familiar with those proposals supported them, with only 22 percent opposed. Democrats and independents supported these proposals in huge numbers while Republicans were split, 51 percent in favor to 47 percent opposed.

[...]

>Overall, questions that seemed to emphasize how police departments would be affected found less support. Reuters/Ipsos respondents who were familiar with “proposals to completely dismantle police departments and give more financial support to address homelessness, mental health, and domestic violence” said they opposed those proposals, 58 percent to 39 percent. That was virtually identical to the way respondents broke down in the pollster’s question about the “‘defund the police’ movement.” And finally, per ABC News/Ipsos, 39 percent supported and 60 percent opposed “reducing the budget of the police department in your community, even if that means fewer police officers, if the money is shifted to programs related to mental health, housing, and education.” That made the specific proposal slightly more popular than “the movement to ‘defund the police’” (34 percent support vs. 64 percent opposition), but the difference was well within the pollster’s margin of error."

> Freeman declined to comment for this article. He has not spoken publicly since May 31, when Ellison took the lead in prosecuting former Minneapolis police officers Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane. Instead, the former two-time gubernatorial candidate and longtime Hennepin County prosecutor has been silent. Ellison, meanwhile, has become the public face of the prosecution, participating in a battery of national news interviews since the case began.

> At the outset, theirs has been a union of necessity: Freeman leads the state’s biggest criminal prosecution unit and last year won the only murder conviction against a Minnesota police officer: Mohamed Noor, who fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond in Minneapolis three years ago.

politics,"> They can either shoot down the legislation next week and face charges of obstruction amid a national reckoning on race — or advance a bill that they say needs massive changes in order to meet the moment.

>Greene finished first in a primary for a deep-red, northwest Georgia seat last week by a nearly two-to-one margin over the second-place candidate. She is entering an August runoff as the heavy favorite to secure the Republican nomination for a district where that is tantamount to winning the general election in November. Her initial victory — which has sparked panic in GOP circles — comes as Republicans are grappling with a national reckoning over racial inequality and police brutality after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last month."

politics,">Last month the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case challenging state laws that bind Electoral College electors to vote for the presidential candidate they are selected to support. The case was brought in response to four 2016 electors — three from Washington and one from Colorado — who tried to vote against their state’s popular vote winner, and, in the case of the Washington electors, faced fines for having broken their pledges.
>
>These so-called “faithless electors” have long been a feature of American presidential elections, but it’s possible that the Supreme Court could shake up the Electoral College system, striking down state laws that try to guarantee electors’ votes by replacing or punishing those who don’t vote as they promised to. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the overall lack of enforcement of electors’ pledge to vote for the winner of their state troubled her, saying, “I made a promise to do something, but that promise is unenforceable.” But Justice Samuel Alito said that overturning the state laws could “lead to chaos where the popular vote is close.”

[...]

>But the bottom line is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down state-level laws, chaos is unlikely to erupt. The guidelines put in place by parties to ensure most electors are faithful serve as a backstop."
politics,">It’s the latest GOP-led plan to target Section 230, which has come under fire from President Donald Trump, his allies and a loose coalition of lawmakers. Trump has called for the legal shield to be “revoked” over GOP allegations that social media companies stifle conservative viewpoints, and last month he asked federal regulators to reinterpret that law to limit its scope.
>
>Lawmakers of both parties have separately suggested amending the law in an effort to address concerns about how the big tech companies moderate content online.

[...]

>Section 230, widely credited with helping the online industry to flourish economically, broadly shields digital services from lawsuits for hosting and taking down user content.
>
>Trump and his allies attacked the legal shield after Twitter slapped fact-checking and warning labels on some of tweets. Facebook declined to act against identical posts on its platforms, drawing praise from Republicans and rebukes from Democrats who criticized the platform's hands-off approach on Trump."
politics,"> Judging by Schumer’s comments, as well as those of leading House Democrats, they’re planning on running for reelection on their response to Floyd’s death, under the knee of the white police officer Derek Chauvin.
> 
> “We need wholesale reform, not piecemeal reform,” Schumer said. “We cannot approach this debate by cherry-picking one or two reforms and calling the job complete. It’s my worry that’s what our Republican colleagues intend to do.”
> 
> It was much the same from James E. Clyburn, the South Carolina representative who is the House Democrats’ whip. He said on the CQ on Congress podcast on June 9 that he had not discussed a policing bill with his senator, Tim Scott, the lone African American Republican in that chamber. That’s significant because Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has tasked Scott with preparing a GOP policing bill. And Clyburn seemed to reject the idea that Senate Republicans could partner with the House, saying that “as an institution the Senate seems to be dedicated to turning the clock back.”
> 
> The Democrats, of course, may be merely staking out a tough posture for negotiations. The bill they offered combines proposals developed over years by representatives in the Congressional Black Caucus with input from the two African American Democrats in the Senate, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California."

politics,">More than 140 such review bodies are operating nationwide, but the influence they have varies considerably—many don’t have much. An oversight proposal supported by Tulsa’s mayor last year struck advocates and some city council members as too weak. Crutcher—whose brother was outside his stalled SUV in 2016 when a Tulsa police officer shot and killed him—wants a review agency with enough authority to prompt change.

[...]

>While just 34 percent of review agencies such as Minneapolis’ said the police “frequently” or “very frequently” put their recommendations into practice, 72 percent of civilian monitor and auditor offices said the same, according to a 2016 report Rosenthal co-wrote. Those bodies represent another type of oversight model, one more likely to have paid staff with training to evaluate police practices and data. Monitor and auditor agencies now account for roughly a quarter of U.S. civilian police oversight, the report found.
>
>Whatever the model, there’s an increasing focus on civilian oversight of policies and training—the “before” rather than just the aftermath. “It’s a lot better to change the conditions that lead to needing to have accountability,” said Brian Corr, immediate past president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement.

_______

This is a very good snapshot of what kinds of civilian law enforcement oversight mechanisms have been tried, what their impact was, and what reformers would like to see in the future. Highly recommend reading this article if you're interested in policing reform."
politics,"> On Wednesday, McConnell teed up the nomination of his protégé Justin Walker for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Senate will likely take up the controversial nomination early next week.
> 
> The demise of the 60-vote filibuster for nominees means Democrats — who might be tempted to cite the Thurmond Rule in June — cannot stop a majority leader who has pledged to “leave no vacancy behind.”
> 
> And if a precedent like that is set by McConnell in an election year, it’s likely the Thurmond Rule is gone for good.
> 
> “I don’t see the Democrats or the Republicans next year saying, ‘Well, let’s let bygones be bygones,’” said Russell Wheeler, president of the Governance Institute and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. “That’s just all out the window.”"
politics,">The new federal bill would change “the standard to evaluate whether law enforcement use of force was justified from whether the force was ‘reasonable’ to whether the force was ‘necessary,’” according to a bill summary sent to McClatchy by the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco.
>
>It would also require “that deadly force be used only as a last resort and requires officers to employ de-escalation techniques first.”
>
>The national legislation would also ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants in federal drug cases, according to Pelosi’s office. It would enable individuals to sue officers in civil court."
politics,"I was interested in his thoughts on police reform. This is a good interview. 

>“Do I think we should not have police departments in America? No, I don’t. There’s no city in the world that does not have police departments. What you need are—I didn’t call for more money for police departments. I called for police departments that have well-educated, well-trained, well-paid professionals. And, too often around this country right now, you have police officers who take the job at very low payment, don’t have much education, don’t have much training—and I want to change that.”

[...]

>“I think we want to redefine what police departments do, give them the support they need to make their jobs better defined. So I do believe that we need well-trained, well-educated, and well-paid professionals in police departments. Anyone who thinks that we should abolish all police departments in America, I don’t agree.”"
politics,">Three paragraphs in the House Democrats’ bill released Monday would wipe out two legal defenses from lawsuits that members of Congress say has made it nearly impossible to hold police accountable through the courts because of qualified immunity.
>
>First, officers couldn’t escape a lawsuit because they were acting in good faith or reasonably believed their conduct was lawful. And second, officers couldn’t argue that the constitutional rights or laws were not “clearly established” at the time of the misconduct, which is the version of qualified immunity in play since a 1982 decision.

[...]

>Arthur Rizer, the director of the criminal justice and civil liberties program at the nonprofit research center R Street, said the three paragraphs in the House bill would “fix a whole hell of a lot” of problems with qualified immunity.
>
>“It would absolutely, fundamentally, turn it on its head,” Rizer said. “And I also think it’d be a clear shot across the bow at, if the Supreme Court did pick something up, they would be on notice of what the congressional intent was.”
>
>Police use of force, similar to the video recorded death of George Floyd at the knee of a police officer in Minneapolis that sparked nationwide protests, is the subject of many blocked lawsuits."

politics,We usually go for the headline that the wire services are running more or less - I can't see how we could make this title much more dispassionate than what we ran with.
politics,">  slightly larger communities that were unmitigated internet hoses?

The problem is that I don't think that many of these services can possibly function at an 'agnostic' scale like you describe. Youtube has already gone through several waves of advertiser pull out turmoil due to concerns about prior content enforcement issues. If you required Youtube to act as an agnostic operator, I'm confident that they would not be able to retain their advertiser system in its current form - and a service like Youtube is already challenging to get to profitability. Youtube - or a theoretical competitor - would just cease to exist. At least while remaining compliant with that incarnation of US law. 

I can see an argument for that also being an acceptable outcome - effectively an end to large scale, user generated websites and social media platforms. But it's a big ask - and there would be many consequences in the fallout."

politics,"> But the likelihood that the order won’t withstand judicial scrutiny misses the point. The threat of the order itself, even as wrong as it is, does exactly the damage Trump wants to do: It pressures companies into giving his content preferential treatment.
> 
> Over the next few months, Twitter and other platforms must gear up to fight the administration as it tries to twist the language of Section 230. They may be hauled in to FTC investigations over whether a removal didn’t occur in good faith or whether a company acted deceptively. These investigations almost certainly will exonerate the companies, but only after they shell out massive attorney fees. At least Twitter is big enough to afford all this; smaller platforms likely cannot.
> 
> And the final catalyst for all of this? Twitter decided to fact-check the president.

> This thought will undoubtedly cross the mind of Jack Dorsey and other Silicon Valley CEOs: Wouldn’t it be easier to let him be? To give more leeway to rule-breakers and purveyors of misinformation? To do nothing in the face of campaigns of mistruth that undermine democracy and trust in government? Thus far, it appears that Dorsey will stand firm. The day after Trump issued the executive order, Twitter notably hid a tweet from the president threatening protestors in Minneapolis that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” However, many other platforms may ask themselves these same questions and find the fight is not worth the risks. For his part, Mark Zuckerberg preemptively capitulated to Trump’s executive order with a statement that Facebook “shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.”
>

politics,">The recommendations before the Legislature came from a 16-member task force that spent more than a year on discussions and public hearings around the state. They include creating an independent unit to investigate cases of deadly force and to increase the power of the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Board to allow officers’ licenses to be suspended or revoked at the request of a supervising officer or sheriff.
>
>State Sen. Jeff Hayden, a DFL assistant minority leader who represents the area where Floyd was arrested, said Thursday that police reform needed to be part of any bonding bill discussions when the Legislature returns. Otherwise, he said, “we are not going to have business as usual and start passing bonding bills and start passing all the other things that we need.”"
politics,">The deepening feud between the president and his go-to social media platform is forcing companies like Facebook and Google to gird for a lobbying battle to defend the legal protections that underpin their lucrative business models, sooner and much more publicly than they had originally expected. Those preparations accelerated this week, even as Facebook made it clear to Trump that it doesn't share Twitter's view of how online platforms should handle political speech.
>
[...]

>As Trump and Twitter sparred this week, NetChoice — whose members include Facebook, Twitter, Google and scores of other big-name online companies — rushed into an effort to convince the American public that Trump is wrong about an obscure provision of a quarter-century-old communications law.
>
>The move, relying on Facebook posts, tweets and explainer videos, is a shift from the group's more typically insidery strategy of lobbying Hill staffers or members of Congress. And it suggests a more expansive approach to how Silicon Valley plans to engage in the messaging battle over the laws governing social media."

Elizabeth Warren, on Thursday wrote to DeVos that the Education Department should “take immediate action to fully remedy this issue, hold Great Lakes accountable for this inexcusable blunder, and provide Congress with a detailed accounting of how this breakdown occurred.”

>All of this is to say that even if Clinton’s lead over Trump doesn’t shrink anymore, Trump might still win. He would need only a normal-sized polling error. Of course, that error would need to be in his favor, and there’s nothing inherent about polling errors that says they must aid the trailing candidate."
politics,">Four years ago, when President Trump was the Republican nominee, he won over voters who didn’t like him or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, which gave him a boost in a general election that featured the two most disliked major-party nominees in history.

>According to exit polls, 18 percent of voters had an unfavorable view of both Trump and Clinton, but when they cast their ballots, they broke 47 percent to 30 percent in favor of Trump. The president’s advantage among these voters was pivotal, too. Trump carried these voters by between 21 and 37 percentage points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three states that put him over the top in the Electoral College.
>
>But now, in 2020, Trump may have lost his edge among the “haters” — that is, the voters who hold an unfavorable view of both presidential candidates. Two recent national surveys found that former Vice President Joe Biden has a big lead over Trump among those who have unfavorable views of them both. An April survey from NBC News/Wall Street Journal put Biden ahead of Trump 60 percent to 10 percent, and an early May survey from Morning Consult gave Biden a lead of 46 percent to 14 percent."

Meanwhile, they’ve been left behind as federal coronavirus relief efforts favor larger cities. The House of Representatives passed another stimulus bill this month that allocates $188 billion for local governments, including smaller towns. It has little chance of passing the Senate. A separate bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate would provide emergency assistance for local budgets.

politics,">But although she had always expected some shifts after Trump won, she hadn’t anticipated the speed with which his administration would dismantle environmental protections. Her Trump-appointed successors at the EPA announced changes to federal standards almost daily. By June 2019, they had done away with the Obama-era regulation to curb carbon emissions from power plants, and set their sights on redrafting a rule to allow cars to discharge more polluting gases—a change that the auto industry itself largely opposed. But late last year, when a rewrite of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, which limits the levels of mercury emitted from power plants, seemed imminent, McCarthy decided that she was ready to make a change.

>So when the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental-advocacy nonprofit that had been searching for a new president, called her last fall, McCarthy said she was in.

>That sort of move is unusual, Jeff Hauser, the founder and the director of the Revolving Door Project, told me. “It’s become increasingly rare to see individuals [hold] a high government office and move into issue advocacy. There’s become a norm that it is both acceptable and expected that people will leave public service to ‘make some real money,’” Hauser said. “That reflects both parties becoming increasingly comfortable with the revolving door [between] private-sector and political appointments.”

politics,That article looks much more directly focused on the political context of Reade and the specifications allegations and counter allegations. And it refers specifically to a report that Politico had earlier published on the subject.

I can easily understand that as well, I appreciate that sentiment. I do feel that our removals here are most in line with our prior policies and approach, but I understand why users may not appreciate or understand that. 

The topic rule asks that articles focus on the explicitly political, and we try as hard as possible to keep that enforcement consistent."
politics,"I don't see your specific comment within the threads that are linked there - it looks like maybe one of yours at least was user deleted later, so it's hard for me to assess why it was originally removed. Generally, I think the response you got in mod mail does not reflect our policies / position - meta comments made in normal threads should not be removed as meta for 'derailing'. 

We have mods (and a few users, though not most by any means) who argue that it does derail threads, and mods who have suggested to autoremove some meta terms for that reason. I'm strongly strongly opposed to that as I feel it's more likely to create paranoia and confusion, and unlikely to keep threads 'on topic'. 

We will remove comments that approach the level of with hunting or brigading in some way - without a direct link to the comment you feel was removed, I can't say whether that occurred there. Most likely something you wrote (or edited, as frequently occurs) triggered automoderator, and the mod who responded to you did not feel it appropriate to reinstate that comment. They could have been wrong, certainly, but I'd need more context to understand."

Which is not to say we don't make errors or mistakes, but it can be an unforgiving dialogue to have."
politics,">That's the strategy, though. This submission was about to hit the frontpage, so they removed it. They want to let one languish around 100 or so upvotes, never actually making the frontpage. Then they can remove any subsequent submissions about this story as ""already submitted.""

It's not really a strategy - when a mod is available to go through the reports, they take action. The first time we remove a unique article (which a unique canonical URL) the duplicate bot that we run ourselves should remove subsequent submissions within 5 minutes.  

>Reddit's moderation system is opaque, broken, and systematically abused by moderators with obvious agendas.

Reddit's core mechanics leave something to be desired in many respect, including I would agree, how moderation functions and is relayed to users. There are other issues with reddit's mechanics that I wish were different as well. 

In regards to this story - all the versions of it I've seen so far as framed as a matter between Reade and her attorney's, not as a story about the allegations she has made against Biden or has it pertains to the campaign. We understand people's interest in the story in the context of r/politics - my belief is that when the campaign or a surrogate makes a statement about this matter, or this story otherwise interacts more meaningfully with the campaign, then we will approve those articles."
politics,I understand the interest in this story but we’re not treating Reade as a political figure on her own - the articles need to be framed explicitly in terms of relevance to the campaign or political process. I’ve been reading these stories concerning gaps in Reade’s story with enormous interest and concern. I’m confident that articles summarizing these updates in the context of the campaign will be published to fill our topics requirements over the next hours and days.

>The deflection is obvious: Facing criticism that he gave China cover while Americans fell ill, Trump wants to depict his opponent as enthralled with China’s leadership. Earlier this year, Trump made repeated statements praising China and its president, Xi Jinping, for working diligently to contain the disease, though more recently, his tone has darkened. Trump praised Xi “before he knew China’s role,” McLaughlin told me. “He was told one thing by China and it turned out not to be true. The president wanted to believe China and rely on them, but found out that he could not.” (One Biden aide said his campaign won’t let voters forget Trump’s encomiums to Xi. “As the coronavirus outbreak was spreading like wildfire, Trump downplayed the historic threat and failed to prepare our nation while promising us that China was handling the outbreak ‘really well’ and ‘transparently,’” Andrew Bates, a Biden-campaign spokesperson, told me. “We’re going to blast him for that unprecedented malfeasance.”)"

She was charged with a crime in 2011, to threaten her for her position on a pandemic nine years later? I don't understand. 

She also has had her work retracted by a reputable journal for failure to sanitize data, resulting in misleading results. I think the fact that the subject has been criticized for poor science is extremely relevant to her importance as a current source of information.

There is no reason to think that any novel, important information is being relayed in the video.

When asked if his video is propaganda by the author, here is his direct response:

Why trust the opinion of someone who makes no claims about intending to find the truth? Their intent is, from the outset, to push an agenda they are invested in, not to explore reality.

politics,"I recommend trying out:

/r/worldpolitics 

/r/geopolitics 

/r/internationalpolitics (I wish this got a restart at some point, it's gone somewhat defunct at last check) 

Also, /r/worldnews covers international political events at times.

/r/politics became the primary US politics specialized subreddit for historical reasons, due to reddit's original userbase being heavily skewed towards US users. That's just how the subreddit culture and rules developed. 

There are a great number of localized subreddit's for politics in other countries as well (/r/ukpolitics comes to mind as a start)."

Now, it's possible that due to regulatory concerns or focus group testing or some other factor, they might be impeded from recognizing that goal. But the longer we go without word of a lot of USB-C collaboration with third party manufacturers happening, the more likely I am to believe they're plowing ahead with a no-port model within the next two years."

Digital_Manipulation,"> I consider it to be a form of, or based in, radicalism. So it is within the broad purview of this sub.

I have an old friend who has serious issues finding shoes that fit him - problem seems to be that he's got crazy narrow / low volume feet. He informed me that he has at present, no less than 11 Zappos boxes sitting in his room for return. This sounds full on crazy to me. 

What he really needs is a semi-dressy derby (semi-dressy for an engineer anyway) - preferably with a hard wearing sole. I have thus far floated - AE Nomad, Rancourt Camden, and White's Otto - all of which have a B width option. Are there manufactures I'm leaving out? Stores in the NYC / tri-state area that would be likely to stock narrow widths (other than AE of course)? Tricks that narrow width bros use to find something that works for them? 

Give me your secrets."

politics,"For the record, I did not read the comment thread and your reasoning for making the post. I read the title - and read the article to confirm the title and that the title was 'literal' so to speak. Then I asked the mod team for input and determined that we felt the piece crossed the line into a direct provocation of harm to the public.

In almost any other instance, I would back your reasoning for submitting the piece - I am huge advocate of understanding the political media ecosystem as a whole, and understand the kinds of articles and headlines that people with differing ideological views are exposed to, even if you still end up disagreeing or disagreeing more strongly with the argument being made. 

However, the direct explicit threat to public action in an emergency crisis makes a title like this as unacceptable as one advocating that people be shot or maimed. 

I don't want you to feel as though we'll punish users for publishing incendiary, controversial or dissenting articles - we actively make an effort to leave space for this. This article and its removal are exceptions."

politics,Huh. I searched through reddit two ways for this. sorry bot bro.
politics,">  The issues listed are mostly those that poll positively,

Depends on the issue, the poll, how the issue is worded in the poll, and how candidates position themselves on a spectrum of policy regarding the issue. 

Let's take healthcare. I think the author is absolutely right to question leftist doctrine on health policy for example - M4A proponents will often point to a small number of polls showing strong (60%+ favorability), but fail to take into account the favorable wording that those polls frame the issue under, and how the opposition will work an issue publically once a proposal actually sees the cold light of a congressional committee. 

Immigration is also a good example of where progressives feel compelled to maximize their position purely in opposition to their opponents chosen framing. [54% of the country says that deporting illegal or undocumented immigrants is 'important' to 'somewhat important'](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/12/americans-immigration-policy-priorities-divisions-between-and-within-the-two-parties/). Only 16% of respondents responded as 'not important at all' - at some level, a pretty overwhelming percentage of the US population believes that deportations of non-legalized immigrants should be a job of the government - yet to read progressive media, one might be under the impression that 'Abolish ICE' was an widely held position."
politics,">You can see this pattern today in the ways that many progressive activists misread public opinion. Their answer to almost every question of political strategy is to insist that Americans are a profoundly progressive people who haven’t yet been inspired to vote the way they think. The way to win, these progressives claim, is to go left, always.

>Immigration? Most Americans want more of it. Abortion? This is a pro-choice country. Fracking? People now understand its downsides. Strict gun control? Affirmative action? A wealth tax? Free college? Medicare for all? Widely available marijuana? Americans want it all, activists claim.

[...]

>By designing campaign strategies for the America they want, rather than the one that exists, progressives have done a favor to their political opponents. They have refused to make tactical retreats, which is why they keep losing."

>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/adu47x/second_man_found_dead_in_california_home_of/

I discuss this story at length elsewhere in this thread. ""Donor who met some politicians is letting people OD in their home and maybe killing them"" is not explicit politics unless it has bearing on current, explicit US politics. That's off topic, it's about as good an example I can think of for a story that is about the non-political life of a potential political figure. 

>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/at849e/what_the_jussie_smollett_case_should_teach/

For the the most part we were insistent that Smollett case stories were off topic, with a few allowances for stories focusing on politician responses and legislative or policy impact. That includes every single story about the initial incident on the day that it was first reported. You can read about attempts to claim that we allowed the story early and stopped later, when it was in fact the opposite [in this excellent data analysis by an outside party](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digital_Manipulation/comments/azuv4d/theres_an_image_currently_circulating_on_reddit/). That said, I can see a case for the editorial you reference as being one of the dozen or so articles that had an explicit politics framing. As we largely treated that story (correctly) off topic, I award you half a point."
OutOfTheLoop,"You can use archive.org to confirm that this is not the case. Mods were added slowly over 2016 as they are on all mod teams, but the top of the mod list remained pretty stable over that election season (again, use archive.org).

People have spread some incorrect interpretations of two events from that period. The first was a mod coup in late 2015 (before I was on the team) that was entirely about cliquey beefing over one moderator that was 'faking' their work, and a higher ranked moderator who didn't want the team to remove them for personal reasons. You can read a summary of that silly drama here:

[Part I: The Coup](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/33xvw9/leaks_a_vote_for_a_high_ranking_rpolitics_mod_to/)

[Part II: When you play the Game of r/politics You Either Win or You Die](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/34fjij/the_game_of_rpolitics_the_return_of/)

TL;DR: higher ranked mod removed half the team because he didn't like a vote that removed their scummy friend. End result: *highest* ranked mod woke up and put everyone back with the coup instigators removed.

Event two was an incident in October of that year where a mid ranked mod had their account compromised (probably due to poor password sanitization). The attacker removed everyone below them and did some vandalism of the CSS. You can read about that vandalism in the OutOfTheLoop post here:

[What's going on at r/politics?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/57f43b/whats_going_on_at_rpolitics/d8rk279/)

When all the mods were re-added by admin security, their added date was reset, which led to a misconception that a large number of mods were added all at once. 

____________________

There were no major replacements of mods, and certainly not senior ranked mods, other than those two events."
OutOfTheLoop,"The market move articles are tricky and I'm sure we have some inconsistent actions there - generally I look to see if they're *really* written from a political perspective. If the first couple paragraphs aren't approaching from a political impact framing, it should be off topic.

But because the economy and Trump's outlook and statements about his presidency have been so intertwined with market performance, this has definitely been a tricky area."
OutOfTheLoop,[Some thoughts on subreddit 'balance' I posted above](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fdam2z/whats_up_with_rpolitics/fjhpdhj/).
OutOfTheLoop,">Here's an idea: moderate the sub so that there is balance instead of all Bernie (or whoever the current flavor is) all the time.

Two things. One is - I'm not sure trying to ""force"" balance is the correct approach, even in an ideal world. This would be targeting an artificial state in which both sides are *automatically* treated as equivalent. But the second thing is that even if I *wanted* to try and curate an artificially 'balanced' feed, it would not really work as reddit's mechanics are intended to work. Reddit is designed *entirely* around the idea of content being chosen by users through voting - there are a lot of ways that moderators can intervene, including manual curation by actively selecting a limited number of posts that they prefer. I don't think manual curation by a select group of ~40 or 50 moderators is in any way ideal for a subreddit of our size - if people are upset now that a majority of users drive content at their whim, I don't see why a lot *more* people wouldn't be even more upset that a tiny minuscule minority of users would drive content at their whim. 

I think people need to accept that reddit is by design, fundamentally incompatible with the curation of a 'neutral' subreddit for contentious subject matter. The only reddit based solution I can endorse is that users create a 'custom feed' or 'multi reddits' of political communities on a range of different backgrounds, so as to give themselves a broader diversity of content. But that too is a highly imperfect way of obtaining information - the submissions you'd see on a custom feed will still be the most emotionally charged that those individual communities have gravitated towards. 

Social media including reddit is designed to maximize engagement - it's not designed to maximize neutrality, ""balance"" or informativeness."
OutOfTheLoop,Fairly sure we were using all the sticky slots for all of last night. We probably just cycled the discussion for a new thread - we cycle every 10-20 thousandish comments because the threads start to have trouble loading for users.
OutOfTheLoop,"Your wording was a little different:

> It's the year to dispose of a dictator by ANY MEANS NECESSARY!

Understand that we see hundreds of threats that people try to obfuscate per day and 'dipose of' is a trigger phrase that gets our eyes narrowed - I can see how a moderator would read that as a potential call to violence. I think I would have voted to toss that back if you had appealed."
OutOfTheLoop,"Nah - I'm too much of a sucker and believe too strongly in 'civic good' and 'the public square of ideas' and the inherent ability of men to struggle past evil and all that kind of stupid crap. 

But let's say we had a mod who *would* sell their account for $25k. It would be *extremely* difficult - I would argue near impossible - to maliciously abuse the subreddit without being detected by the rest of the mod team. The first time that a mod removed / or approved something that they should not have, it would be discussed in mod mail. They could play it off as disagreement or as a mistake - but that would not pass muster if it happened repeatedly."
OutOfTheLoop,">This is an advanced version of ""they do it for free!""

It is one of my favorite memes though."
OutOfTheLoop,"> there about certain individuals is despicable

If you see a user being uncivil or worse towards another, report it and we will try to action it as quickly as we can. But if you're asking people to only say nice things about politicians or political actors on the internet... I think you'd really just be better off asking for the internet to be turned off. Which is how I feel some days in fairness. 

> the fact the mods let it all go and tries to justify it is just funny. 

The mods volunteer to play janitor for a community of millions, with hundreds of thousands of comments per week, for free. We do some cleanup as best we can, but asking us to take credit for the actions of hundreds of thousands of users seems a little unrealistic. 

>Right now it should be called r/The_Bernie

I think some of the top level comments in this thread address the subject of consensus bubbles and how reddit's core mechanics reinforce them - I think those are pretty good takes. In a smaller community with a high ratio of mods to users, it may be possible to 'directly' shape the flow of discussion. At the volume r/politics operates at, I don't think that's a real possibility."
OutOfTheLoop,"r/politics was removed as a default... what, 7 maybe eight years ago at this point? If you ask me, the reasoning was probably that reddit inc. preferred not to have any 'controversial' or toxic discussion on the default page - and have you *ever* seen a political discussion on the internet that wasn't toxic or inflammatory? 

In any case, there has been 100% mod turn over since that period, with completely different rules and implementation of policy. You may think r/politics is bad, that's completely fine - but the issues you have with r/politics almost certainly have nothing to do with the reasons the admins didn't want it as a default years ago."
OutOfTheLoop,"We're 40ish volunteers doing a job that loud voices from all sides hate that we're doing. But very often people show me examples of things that they think should have been removed, and I'll look and agree ""Yeah, we missed that"" or sometimes ""Yeah that was a bad call, we shouldn't have done that"". We collectively do maybe a hundred thousand mod actions a month. We receive thousands of link submissions a day, and hundreds of thousands of comments per week - we do miss things, and we do make mistakes. If people want *perfect* moderation at all hours of the day, then they shouldn't use reddit which is volunteer and user driven.

But the examples you provide are regarding subjects that I have looked at, spent more than a little time thinking hard about, and concluded that our approach is the correct one for our policies and constraints. 

You don't like r/politics. You don't like the way our rules are structured - because you think the emotionally weighted culture wars stories are important. That's fine, I can at least understand that. You don't like most of our users and the way they vote - that's fine, I understand that. 

We are enforcing our rules as neutrally and consistently as is realistically possible given our free time and the reality of our volume. None of the examples above pass the test for what I would objectively call mistakes."
OutOfTheLoop,"Default subs have not existed for years and years, the new user onboard process makes defaults non-existent."
OutOfTheLoop,"In the beg bug article on The Hill, the article text opens with the politically relevant framing:

>, Fla. The news resurfaced following the announcement that the U.S. will host next year’s Group of Seven (G-7) summit at the Trump property.

>In the day after White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters that the 2020 G-7 summit would take place at Trump National Doral, nearly 30,000 tweets had been sent using the hashtag.

If your Ed Buck articles opened with ""And that's why Hillary Clinton will not be attending the LA Fundraiser for blah blah blah"" it would be approved. 

>As for your ""media on media"" bullshit, how about this actual megathread you guys set up for twitter banning political ads? https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dpckgv/megathread_ceo_jack_dorsey_says_twitter_has/

Megathreads are to consolidate a story that is taking too high a percentage of r/politics/rising or our front page - the story was pertinent as it pertained to the active campaigns and advertising spending of candidates.

>Also very interesting, Ed Buck killing 5 people in his home is not germane to politics (even though it fucking is) but Epstein's death is SUPER relevant, yeah? https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/coiuza/ocasiocortez_calls_for_answers_after_epstein/

We removed hundreds of stories about the Epstein case because it just WAS NOT explicit US politics. I received death threats over that story. When AOC comments on the matter and threatens legislative action - a congressional inquiry - then it becomes politics. Comments that Republican officials made regarding that case were also approved. 

>Less than two hours old: activists file appeal. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fddcd5/youth_activists_appeal_ruling_that_they_cant_sue/ where's the politics? I don't see any political actors speaking in that thread.

Judicial precedent is usually within our scope if it has bearing on US policy or legal structure. SCOTUS cases are almost universally in our scope for example. But your article also has this text:

“In overturning the district court, the majority fundamentally changed the way our branches of our government operate, placing the president and Congress beyond the reach of judicial oversight. If this opinion stands, there will be no more constitutional checks and balances on government conduct,” Philip Gregory, a co-counsel for the youth plaintiffs, argued. 

That's more than sufficient for our focus. 

You've yet to show me one link where I think we were in the wrong."
OutOfTheLoop,"> Haha what, you guys let literally HUNDREDS of ""Trump supporter attacks [minority] person"".

No we do not, we remove those. Despite the apparent widespread belief otherwise, we even removed the Jussie Smollett incident stories during the first hour that his version broke. [Here is an excellent thread and data analysis written by a neutral third party that I highly recommend reading on the Smollett story in r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Digital_Manipulation/comments/azuv4d/theres_an_image_currently_circulating_on_reddit/). The only versions of that story that were approved pertained to comments from elected officials and discussion in a policy / legislating context."
OutOfTheLoop,">Why was the Trump hotel bedbug story allowed,

If any were left I apologize because they shouldn't have been - I know that I personally remember removing a dozen articles on that story. Some articles about potential conflicts of interest regarding the president's stake in hotels have been approved, but general `XYZ terrible thing happened in ABC Trump property` are removed with high frequency. There's also a survivor-ship bias - if we miss something by accident, you'll notice it. You don't notice the thousands of removals per month, and it doesn't help that the user base votes on an ideological axis that you disagree with.

>Why is former President Carter's words allowed when they're anti-Trump

Carter talking about the actions of the president or his administration is discussion of elected officials and policy. Obama talking about people being cancelled on Twitter is not. 

I addressed the Ed Buck story in a second comment but I also strongly support the removals of non-politicaly framed articles regarding that story. To flip it back - if we approved every The Root article or Thing Progress piece about some insane or criminal thing that a Trump supporter or donor had done, you'd hate that equally. A donor's personal problems - or massive criminal culpability - are not explicit politics by default. The article text has to frame the story as a focus on politics, and the Ed Buck stories are not that."
OutOfTheLoop,"> No, now their strategy is to tell you it's already been submitted. Take this article on Ed Buck, democratic megadonor who has been killing drug addicts to satisfy his sexual habits in West Hollywood, frequently pictured with the Clintons.
> 
> 

Perfect example of a story that is clearly not in our scope. 

Our subreddit is not the place to submit every `Silver Party Voter Does XYZ TERRIBLE THING~`. We remove for example, articles about individual crimes that may have had political subtext because what one person with a red hat or a Sanders sticker does is not the focus of a subreddit for explicit US politics. It's emotionally charged culture war fodder, not politics."

The Avenatti stuff regarding his personal life is 100% out of our scope of topic - we removed articles about Eric Trump's divorce and Sean Hannity's real estate troubles as well. Our rules specify that the non-political activity of political figures isn't automatically in our scope. That gets a little bit trickier when we're talking about elected officials whose private lives are heavily intertwined with their job, but Avenatti wasn't that, he was just a dumb talking head.

Some of this was on, some was off but for the most part, Media on Media as we refer to it is out of scope - take to r/InTheNews. We remove hundreds of ""Person at Fox News did X"" every week as well. 

>https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dp4eue/barack_obama_calls_out_woke_culture_and_twitter/

Some of these were on, some were off but mostly off because a *former* president talking about Twitter personalities is NOT explicit US politics as our rules define it.

_________

You disagree with the scope of topic we've set, that's your right and I respect that. If you want to see more culture war / media focused submissions, use a different subreddit. We are very clear that it is not what r/politics is configured to focus on."
OutOfTheLoop,"I think people have to learn what it means when social media algorithmic curates content for your consumption - trending tags and upvotes equal the consensus of the simple majority of users. r/politics isn't built to be 'bi-partisan' per say, it's built to be an open platform for users to participate and discuss US politics - but it's the *users* who decide which stories go up and down on the page, and it's the users who decide which comments are visible and not. Reddit's core mechanics are designed around the idea of majority rule, and at the scale of a sub as large as r/politics, nothing will realistically change that. 

This behavior isn't limited to just r/politics."
OutOfTheLoop,"Sorry but:

We do it for free."
OutOfTheLoop,"I would ask that you provide an example of something marked off topic that should have been marked on topic. r/politics has an *explicit US politics rules* - that moves content in the direction of discussion of elections, legislation, policy etc - it tends to punish things that are only subtextually or culturally 'politics'."
OutOfTheLoop,"This is in no way accurate. You might be downvoted by users, but r/politics is an open platform as the rules and moderation are structured. Conservative sources - even controversial ones that the majority of users detest - are permitted for submission."
OutOfTheLoop,"Hello I'm an r/politics mod. I strongly contest this assessment: 

We try extremely hard to overlook the ideological lean or supporter preference of content we moderate. The vast majority of moderator manual actions (removals and bans) is focused on removing off topic submissions, and on removing user directed incivility and toxicity. We issue temporary bans on a stepped scale to try and encourage users who are uncivil, insulting or toxic towards others not to attack other users. 

I think the correct take is that reddit's core mechanics reward majority rules, and that fosters a consensus bubble effect to a certain extent. Reddit's core design is not particularly conducive towards in depth discussion of *contentious* subjects due to the way in which upvoting /downvoting work."
OutOfTheLoop,"Shareblue and Correct the Record are different organizations with different tasks. CTR - which when I last checked in 2018 had no operating budget and is shuttered - was a PAC vehicle that was allegedly configured to 'counter disinformation' on social media - which people read to mean ""shill farm"". 

Shareblue was a for profit media blog that has a lot more in common - including former staff - with the Media Matters organization than correct the record. A look at their masthead and structure confirms that they're really more of a pseudo news organization than a PAC or viral advertising or campaigning arm. 

In any case: Shareblue's news content has been banned in r/politics for two years, after it was confirmed that a staff member was posting there without identifying themself as their rules required. So the idea that 'Shareblue owns and operates r/politics' is nakedly preposterous. And for what it is worth, Media Matters and CTR's content have never been permitted at any time in the last 5+ years as well.

I think the take discussed in this thread as ""reddit's core demographic a) loves Bernie b) hates Trump, so they upvote only on those factors and reddit rewards upvotes"" is the correct take. It doesn't require a conspiracy to create the environment in r/politics - just reddit's mechanics and a majority opinion."

politics,"> outperforms everyone *but Biden*

I think glossing over that aspect so quickly would be a mistake."
politics,"I don't see why it would surprise people that the majority of Democratic leadership would be tepid on Sanders as the nominee. Why? Well - I think most elected Democrats would probably agree that actually *passing* a M4A package is unlikely - so on his most prominent campaign promise, there's going to eventually going to have to be a reckoning as house reps from more conservative districts have to take sides in a legislative fight that a Sanders presidency is going to have an uphill battle on. 

While Sanders has a pretty solid national favorability rating, we have yet to see what happens when the entirety of the conservative media establishment and political apparatus assaults him at once. I'm not going to say one way or the other how I think that would play out, but my feeling is that Democratic leadership assumes that he has more vulnerability than other candidates - again, I make no assessment as to whether that would hold true. 

Many of the house seats flipped from red to blue in 2018 were done so in purple districts, where candidates ran on a platform of reinforcing the ACA and slowing the Trump administration's dismantling of existing programs. [Democrats from competitive districts feel that a Sanders campaign could be devastating to down ballot races in competitive districts](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sanders-success-ramps-concern-among-congressional-democrats-n1136456), and that the control of the house could be jeopardized.

politics,"Isaac Chotiner interviews University of Georgetown professor of history - and editor of *Dissent* magazine - Michael Kazin on the subject of senator Sanders' presidential campaign in the historical context of the progressive movement in the United States.

> It’s good to be a historian. I don’t have to predict the future; I can just tell you what happened in the past. But it depends how he does. If he loses the way George McGovern or Walter Mondale lost, well, what happened after those losses were centrists, moderates, those who call themselves New Democrats were emboldened. And they were able to make the argument that this was a radical left turn and a big mistake, and that Americans didn’t want what the Democrats were selling and so they had to go different ways. So it really depends on how badly he loses, if he loses. If he comes close and Democrats keep the House, then it maybe won’t be considered such a disaster. And people can say, “Well he was the best candidate we could have put up. Nobody else was going to be better. And maybe the divisions in the Party were part of the problem of why he lost.”
> 
> And so a lot of people will think, Well, his ideas were popular—and his ideas are popular, I think. But I think he will be seen as a character who changed the Party, whether he wins or loses, because the Party, since 2015, when he started running, has moved to the left in policy terms and in rhetorical terms as well.
> 
> But again, in politics, it’s all about winning and losing and all about if you lose, how you lose, if you win, how you win. And, I think that the danger of Sanders’s nomination is that he will lose badly. The great promise, if you’re on the left, is that he might actually win. And then we’ll have a quite remarkable situation.

politics,"1. A fundamental underlying assumption of communist philosophy is the principle of LTV, an economic claim with no correlation with the observed reality of how human economic systems behave. It does not model appropriately for scarcity,demand fluctuation and many other observed principles that make all other claims about economic systems made by communist theory suspect as counter factual.  
2. Planned economies require consolidation and centralization of systems and institutions. Abstractly this might not necessarily be a major negative, but seeing as how no communist or centralized economy has effectively redistributed power through new democratic or mass movement driven systems, we can comfortably say that communist planning has a history of coinciding with an increase in state authority, and a decrease in individual autonomy.
2. The largest communist states of the 20th century had a documented history of ethnic and religious repression, environmental damage, and widespread corruption. Quibbling aside about whether liberal / market driven societies were *absolutely* better or worse, it is hard to make the claim that a communist state would be *free* of repressive systems seeing as the ones that claimed that label were very observably maintaining the cycles of oppression that present day civil and public rights activists seek to fight against. 20th century communist states also failed to demonstrate an advantage in [environmental care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk) and preservation.  

The contemporary advocates of 20th century styled communism seem often to me, much more interested in the aesthetics and romanticism of movements that are well past their time. Looking objectively at states and systems that worked and didn't work, these are some of the reasons that I think it is inadvisable to identify with communist states or philosophy."
politics,"> Pretty much the entire current power structure of the Democratic party falls right here.

This seems wildly out of line with what I understand to be true about the current leadership.

The [governor's office introduced an ethics reform package for the New Jersey government](https://www.njspotlight.com/2020/02/legislature-squarely-in-sights-of-murphys-ethics-reform-package/), with a heavy emphasis on reducing conflicts of interest and ethical violations within the state legislature. 

>One bill would eliminate the broad exclusion from the state’s Open Public Records Act that the Legislature enjoys for all communications and memos related to lawmakers’ official duties. Some legislative officials have cited this exemption liberally to deny the press and the public access to certain documents. A similar exemption does not exist for the executive branch. OPRA would continue to have two dozen other reasons that all officials, including lawmakers, could use for not providing the public with requested documents.

>Another would prohibit legislators and their staff from accepting gifts related to their public duties, as executive-branch staffers are banned from doing. Currently, lawmakers can accept gifts — such as meals, event tickets and hotel rooms — as long as they believe they are not meant to influence their legislative actions. It would ban high-level legislative staff from getting any outside income without prior approval by the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards. It also would require them to fill out the same, more detailed financial disclosure form that many high-level executive branch employees and members of state agencies and commissions must complete. The State Ethics Commission forms are 11 pages long,  ask more questions and are all in an easy-to-read form. The legislative forms span four pages, cover fewer income ranges and often are still handwritten.

The package contains a total of five separate bills, being sponsored by Sens. Richard Codey (D-Essex) and Chris Brown (R-Atlantic) and Assemblyman Ryan Peters (R-Burlington). Outlook for passage is uncertain so far, with some murmurs that the heavily legislature focused bill may have difficulty obtaining widespread support with those it targets (legislators).

NJ Transit had a difficult week. State senate president Sweeney (D, NJ-3) lambasted the agency after senior employees failed to show up for scheduled inquiries before the state legislature. [NJT's CEO Kevin Corbett appeared before a special senate committee and answered questions for three hours regarding a myriad of issues](https://www.nj.com/traffic/2020/02/on-the-hot-seat-nj-transits-boss-apologizes-vows-the-agency-will-do-better.html), as the agency faces criticism for repeated infrastructure failures, delays and management issues

[Last week Sweeney also floated the idea of a constitutionally protected NJ Transit budget pool of $500 million, and new business taxes to raise revenue for their operational expenses](https://www.njspotlight.com/2020/02/sweeney-floats-njt-funding-plan-with-constitutional-twist-new-amendments-to-protect-the-cash/). The NJ Transit budget has a history of being embattled and fought over within the budgeting process. Criticism  was swift from state business advocates including the chamber of commerce 

>“Investing in transportation, whether it’s our roads and bridges and highways, or if it’s our train infrastructure, airports, whatever it might be, is important for our business community and important for our business climate,” said Christopher Emigholz, vice president of government affairs for the New Jersey Business & Industry Association. “But can we figure out a way to focus on transportation without new money?”

 Criticism has also focused on the state's continued diversion of funds from state allocated clean energy funding toward NJ Transit's operation expenses."
politics,Can you elaborate on how you think this interacts with Medicare and healthcare plan proposals? To me this bill seems very focused on employee retirement plans - if anything it would be more pertinent to existing federal laws on defined contribution savings under the IRS.
