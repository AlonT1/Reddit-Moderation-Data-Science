ToyotaTacoma,Looks like the limited
WTF,Hurtful but true :(
Conservative,I'm surprised conservatives like Romney... didn't he vote to convict trump during the impeachment?
cars,"When Nissan got a new CEO around that time, he had this big goal of trying to increase market share in America to 10%, which means more volume, which means cost cutting to get more cars out the door. They basically made themselves into the cheap car quality brand we know them as today."
Conservative,"That doesn't work. Maximizing profits can help with wellbeing, but its never guaranteed. Look at internet service providers and net neutrality. Less government regulation with our internet and companies like AT&T and Comcast both add data caps and charge more to make them unlimited. How does that help the consumers well being at all? That example could be applied to numerous companies, including big pharma."
politics,Plus the runoffs historically have a more Republican voter turnout than the general election.
podcasts,"I like this podcast, but boy is it dense, I probably only retain half of the things they talk about."
ToyotaTacoma,"I am using one, forgot that in the write-up."
ToyotaTacoma,That's the one
ToyotaTacoma,It is connected to the truck battery.
ToyotaTacoma,"I bought a roll of white LED lights on eBay, a magnet switch and a button. You can look at my other comment to see how it works!"
ToyotaTacoma,"I made it with parts individually. It uses a magnet on the tailgate that open the circuit, so it turns on off when you open the tailgate. It's connected to a button that can keep the lights off if you want to leave the tailgate open with the lights off. That is connected to the battery with a 12awg wire that I snaked through the chassis. It's all soldered together behind the left tail light."

AskTrumpSupporters,Don't you think we should elect representatives who have health care regulation in our interest?
CrusaderKings,Thank you. What are the 'name titles' called? I keep calling them titles but if you google that you obviously get land titles.
CrusaderKings,How do you get titles next to your name like 'the scholar' or 'the great'
AskTrumpSupporters,"If one person is racist, and they are left wing, does not make the entire group racist. Does this make sense? I don't watch videos of trump supporter rednecks calling for racist crap (I could find plenty) and call all trump supporters racist rednecks."
AskTrumpSupporters,"The right is fundamentally racist in its current US incarnation but it also trends toward this in general. 

I could literally say the exact same thing about the right, and it's just as believable.
Don't you think this is counter productive? To categorize an entire group as racist?"
AskTrumpSupporters,"That seems unfair to label him with a complete guess, no? 
I'm a biden supporter and I think hurling racist shit at trump supporters is wrong. Does this mean all biden supporters think racist shit is wrong? Or does it take one person to completely represent the left?"
politics,"On the contrary though, trump is more or less a symptom of the Obama presidency. Whether you like joe or not, conservative voters will probably elect another trump type after biden if biden doesn't step up and be more progressive."

AskTrumpSupporters,"It's hard to assess political extremism from the other side. We see news constantly about the extremes of both sides and never the moderate stuff.

Don't you think you think it's ridiculous that people on the right view liberals as rioters and looters? It's the same principal."

oneplus,"Got it for 500$ a couple weeks ago. Cannot believe it's only 500. 90hz, great screen, great battery, and 5g. Only thing it doesn't have is wireless charging, otherwise it's quite similar to 1000$+ phones"
politics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism
politics,Agreed. It's not quality journalism though. I would rather she leave out her opinion and give it to me straight.

oneplus,Is this with Gcam or OnePlus camera app?
personalfinance,"The classic r/financialIndependence answer is Vanguard ETFs like VTSAX, but they have a lot more.

I recommend going to the Vanguard website and looking at all their ETFs. I would recommend total market ones but things like REIts are good too. Look at performance and risk tolerance for each one, Vanguard has graphs and lots of good info."

Entrepreneur,Yea op why don't you post like a gumroad screenshot of proof?
cscareerquestions,At Amazon? Interesting. Thought they were more cut throat about longer hours there.
cscareerquestions,"For me, it's I'm more apt to take breaks at home where is no boss and co-workers around judging me for pulling up YouTube, or going on a walk. Being at home also allows me to work on home stuff between work sessions.

Basically, there are way more distractions with less consequences (not necessarily a bad thing)"
webdev,"Oh boy, you need to educate yourself"
ToyotaTacoma,I feel like oil changes are so cheap and convenient it's not even worth doing yourself tbh
politics,I thought you couldn't work because childcare? Why are you paying for daycare?

cscareerquestions,"My company allows for both and it's amazing. Definitely find a company that allows for both, besides pay, it my number 1 job need."
technology,The idea of the lockdown is pretty simple and pretty rational. Don't overload the health facilities. Even if you are a low risk recipient it's still possible they might have to be hospitalized. The health system overloading is NOT ideal.
MTU,"Sounds like free credits, lol"
AskTrumpSupporters,What history of fuck ups?
Conservative,Yelling at your family dinner is not a leftist thing. It's an asshole thing that leftists and conservatives can do.
Conservative,"It doesn't have to be everything for free. Essentially, the very rich will take the brunt of taxation through a wealth tax. Also, citizens will get taxed more, but we won't have health insurance to pay into. They balance each other out. You might pay a little more, but everything is MUCH more affordable."
cars,"Ah, makes sense. For comfort, I would say pretty good. There is no power seat from 16-19, so that's the only bummer. But I'm a short guy (5'6''), and the seating position is near perfect. The climate control is also old fashioned knobs as opposed to the modern day ""set the temp"" dials.

It's entirely preference. If you want more features, I would suggest the Colorado or the Silverado, but you would be taking a large reliability hit.

Good luck!"
cars,"If you are considering a Tacoma, I own a new gen Tacoma, and perhaps I can give you some input. 

A few notes: 

Prepare to pay a lot in fuel. The engine is old and I avg about 18mpg in avg city driving.

It's not that fun to drive, it drives like a truck. The transmission is not the best, but it can merge on a highway easily. Just don't expect to weave around traffic and pass people.

It's one of the most reliable trucks on the market. 45k miles, not a single issue. Granted, that's low miles, but many people 100k on these things report little to no issues.

Unless you plan on doing off-road, don't opt for the expensive trims like the sport or the off-road. I have the off road trim, and while it provides a great deal of tools for off-roading, it's completely pointless for someone like you who needs to haul home Depot stuff.

With all that being said, I would recommend a slightly used 3rd gen Tacoma. For you, go with the SR5 trim. 4x4 is up to you, but I have continental all terrain tires, and have never needed 4x4 in the snow, I use it strictly for off road."

Also, are you just skating by? Employers are able to tell when you're apathetic about your degree, and it's not like the low GPA will help.

Also, what are your interests? Mechanics? Gaming, animals, fitness, etc.? Might help put you on the right path with that.

college,"Here is what I think man. You have to think to yourself, is another two years of tuition, low paying/no job, and living at college worth it? Do you even want to go back to school. Nothing is worse than going into a career for 40 years and be miserable the entire time, I get that, but you might have waited too long. Heres what I would do. You should be able to pass your final year, right? Do that. Get your degree. Then get any sort of job possible. Now you have to look at careers you want to do. Not the degree, but the specific jobs. Want to be botanist in a lab? Look up that job and see what the degree requirements are (that was just an example). after that, I would consider if the time and money is worth going back to school. See if you can get any cheaper alternatives to a uni as well, like maybe CC or online.


Currently a CS major, so not familiar with any jobs you might be interested. But do your homework. Research jobs you might like.


The best of luck to you. Whatever you do, don't get stuck in a job you hate for the rest of your life."
