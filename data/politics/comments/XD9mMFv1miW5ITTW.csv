> Smacking someone on the ass to humiliate them is assault, harassment etc. Smacking someone on the ass because you are satisfying your desires IS closer to sexual assault. Which one do you think this guy was doing? If you say sexual assault I donâ€™t think your being intellectually honest.

The offender's intent is trumped by the violation of the victim's body/person.

> Touch + hit spot = sexual assault regardless of intent? Where are you getting this definition of sexual assault? Clearly everyone agrees with you since Iâ€™m getting downvoted. Iâ€™m legit curious where this broad definition is coming from.

AskNetsec,"That's pretty much how I got started. CTFs are just puzzles. You gotta start somewhere, learning as you go, and once you have a little bit of experience under your belt, you'll notice that it's easier to get started on other CTFs. A lot of the same concepts, skills, and challenges {presented differently} can be found across various CTFs.

If you can join a team with people who already know a good bit about it and are willing to show you what they're doing, that is a great way to learn quickly."

TrueAtheism,"Yes, I agree that there is no judge who doles out karma based on what you do or do not do in your lifetime. The Buddhist version of karma tends to extend beyond one's present life into what they may have done or not have done in past lives as well. That certainly goes against a lot of atheist considerations because there is no proof or evidence that past lives actually occurred. Either way, all of that doesn't necessarily require a judge, it could just be your karmic energy in the universe going around and impacting you based on your previous actions in this life or a past one.

While I don't believe any of this, it's a lot easier for me to grasp the concepts and consider that they could possibly exist more so than the concept of a deity or judge or God of any sort."
