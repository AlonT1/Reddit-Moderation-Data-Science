This is a slap in the face to consumers, and the fact that Sephora is trying to market it as the next “evolution” of the Beauty Insider program is just ridiculous.

I am seeing fewer and fewer reasons to stick around, and I say this as someone who has spent many, many years loyal to Sephora. 

I just don’t get why obvious downgrades to the program are trying to be spun in a positive light. Who is doing their marketing research?! Sephora is surely going to lose customers and revenue from this decision. I’m sure ULTA will be thrilled to pick up the slack though!"

muacjdiscussion,"I have blue-grey eyes and never experienced any changes in my eye color. If you read the clinical research carefully, you’ll find that the eye color change side effect was only found in patients that were directly instilling the bimatoprost (what Latisse contains) for glaucoma treatment. Since you aren’t putting the drops directly in your eye, there is a very, very low chance that this would ever happen while using Latisse. 

I am also a contact lens wearer, and you should only use Latisse (or whatever generic) after you have removed your contacts for the night. "
