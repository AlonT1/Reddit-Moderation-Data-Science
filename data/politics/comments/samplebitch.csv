vuejs,"I have used Firebase for one project, yes.  Sorry if I didn't explain more clearly, but I meant you would use NodeJS instead of PHP/laravel.

So your web interface would be VueJS, your server backend would be NodeJS, and you would connect to Firebase using javascript.  With this setup your entire stack is javascript based and you won't have to worry about learning PHP an Laravel on top of that.

Although - and maybe this is what you were getting at - perhaps you were looking to have the entire backend run by firebase?  (I think I was initially confusing 'firebase' with 'firestore', which is just the database portion.  So you could use NuxtJS which takes a Vue app and compiles it to a static site, upload it all to firebase and you're done.  No nodeJS necessary other than for development purposes."
vuejs,"Being familiar with everything you've mentioned/are considering, and the fact that you presumably don't know PHP (and thus Laravel) *and* javascript, I might say Vue/Firebase with a NodeJS backend.  Now you're only having to deal with javascript across the board, rather than learning PHP and then Laravel on top of that, along with javascript."

Looks like you did a great job and unless you highlighted the 'blemishes' no one would ever know. :)  Although I understand, I'm pretty critical on myself when I make things too.  As long as it works, it's a job well done!"
hobbycnc,"Thanks.  I forgot the name of the other one I've been looking at, but just remembered it's the 'PrintNC' or something like that.  Apparently the MPCNC has stability issues since the joints are plastic?  The PrintNC uses printed parts but none are part of the joints.  It seems like it costs more for the materials (steel rectangular rails).

I don't any desire to work with aluminum, I just wanted to do things like make wooden signage or plaques, maybe laser cutting as well.  Seems like the PrintNC might be overkill?"

politics,"FYI your facts aren't exactly correct.  The fired prosecutor was corrupt.  He specifically was not investigating Burisma (along with many other companies) when he should have been, because he got paid off not to investigate the owner.  Most western countries wanted him gone as well.  The US basically said 'get rid of this corrupt guy or you won't get assistance from us'.

This seems to get glossed over a lot, since the narrative being put out there is exactly the opposite - that Biden tried to cover up corruption by getting a prosecutor fired for getting too close."

politics,"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  So far we have an unknown person dropping off a laptop at a repair shop, never picking it up, and the shop owner finds damning emails from Hunter Biden.  Ok, that's already really vague to begin with, but let's continue.  This shop owner contacts the FBI but then also makes a copy of the hard drive for himself and shares it with friends.

Suddenly Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon, both who are far from truthful and have both participated in 'creating dirt' on opponents in the past, get wind of this mysterious laptop.  Weird, but let's continue.

This story is published in The New York Post, which isn't exactly the bastion of solid reporting and is owned by Rupert Murdoch.  The author of the article is someone who worked as a producer for Hannity.  She has written exactly three articles for the Post, and they are all with today's date.

Now lay this against a backdrop where both the Durham probe and the unmasking probe, both of which were supposed to show pure corruption by Obama/Biden, have both turned up nothing.  So how interesting this story drops after their two big blockbuster surprises fizzled out.

The fact is, whoever is making these claims need to provide proof.  It's not up to everyone else to prove that it's false.  Add in all the other factors mentioned above and the story really should be taken with a grain of salt until more solid proof exists."

OutOfTheLoop,"I used to take offense at the term 'white privilege' as well - as if white folks have it all great and when someone says you have 'privilege' when in fact you've had a real up hill struggle your entire life, it makes you discount the term.  But imagine everything you've gone through in life, good or bad - but now you're black.  Assuming you're not homeless now, something good happened to you somewhere - someone took a chance on you and gave you a job, or whatever.  Do you think maybe the fact that you don't have black skin perhaps gave you a slight edge, if nothing else?  There's lots of things we take for granted that we don't even think about.  Not thinking ""is today the day"" when getting pulled over by a cop.  Or getting stalked in a grocery store to make sure you're not stealing.  Or some Karen playing the race card as she calls 911 on you for getting too close to her.   Or not getting a call back on your job application because your name is 'ethnic sounding'.  Or being able to find housing close to where your job is.  

I think the point of the term 'white privilege' is not that white people have it great - it's that any struggle a white person has is even more of a struggle and hurdle in life for those who are not white."
OutOfTheLoop,Check out just about anything by Nujabes.  He died in a car accident a few years ago but he's what got me into this genre to begin with.  Hell he may have been a pioneer of this style.  Not really sure of the origins.

iamatotalpieceofshit,"For real.  I went to Red Rock Canyon on my first trip out there.  It was pretty impressive.  On a second trip I was by myself (got there a day before a co-worker and had time to kill) so I went to Valley of Fire - holy shit that place is amazing.  Going by myself towards the end of the day with hardly any traffic, it was the most silent outdoor experience I've ever had.  No wind, no birds or bugs chirping, no traffic noise - just complete silence.  Very eery."

Coronavirus,"I figured it was Orlando as well.  He probably didn't want to say it because it would affect tourism.  But there's only so many airports that could have that many infected employees.  Tampa, Orlando, Sanford, and Melbourne are the only ones I can think of.  I'd be surprised if Melbourne even has 260 employees."
Coronavirus,"Yeah I'm on the other side of the state but it's the same all over, I think.  It's really odd.. I don't know if it's a 'class' issue or what, but I live in sort of a mixed area with both upper and lower middle class, as well as straight up poor areas.  When I shop at Publix (which I guess is the preferred choice for the upper-to-middle middle class), I'd say I see 60% of the people wearing masks.  When I go to Winn-Dixie which is in the lower income area, hardly anyone is wearing a mask.  I avoid Walmart like the plague (lol) but I can imagine no one there is wearing a mask either.

Hydroponics,"I'm in the same boat!  Looks like you're doing both dutch bucket and NFT?  I have been watching videos like crazy and wanted to do NFT, but then realized that's only good for smaller plants, and I really want to grow tomatoes and peppers, so I decided to do dutch bucket as well.

I'm thinking I'll run everything from one reservoir - a T-joint from the pump's output will divert water up to the NFT as well as to the dutch bucket line.  Only issue there is everything will be on the same nutrients but I've seen others doing that with positive results.  Perhaps eventually I'll separate the tomatoes/peppers so I can fine tune the nutrients.

Here's my NFT design.  The reservoir will go in the storage area below, and since this will be on my back deck, I'm going to put casters on the bottom so I can move it around if needed.

I don't think he's ever done anything that would suddenly turn a non-Trump 2016 voter into a Trump 2020 voter, and I certainly think he's lost a lot of support from those 75k voters that put him over the edge."

It continued to get worse - the area grew, with yellow areas turning to purple, and then I noticed that there was a gap between the screen and the frame."

Coronavirus,"Yes you can.  Moderators don't automatically get the green flair.  They have to specifically choose ""distinguish this"".  It should be used for ""hey I'm a moderator, here's something subreddit related"".  Not ""hey look at me I wield a tiny bit of power here""."
drunkencookery,Mmm... oreo-flavored waffles.  Genius!
321,"Awesome, thanks!"
321,"There's also this if you think it would be helpful.  Lots of orders for those, too.  They just take a long time to print.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX1YDE91iyE&feature=emb_title"
321,Thanks - Where'd you find this?  I'd like to keep up to date.
321,"Sorry for using uncommon terminology.  I would have thought that by now ""PPE"" has entered the common lexicon.  And yes a ""Maker"" is someone (usually a hobbyist) who makes things with 3D printers, laser cutters, cnc machines or even people who sew. There are things called 'maker spaces' where these people can go and use all of the various machines available.  You pay a monthly fee to have access to the facilities.  I'm not building or managing a website.  I posted a couple weeks ago about how people can help (sign up on GetUsPPE.org) -  I am now organizing those interested individuals in helping the local community.  There are lots of people 'making' but very little direction in where it needs to go, what is needed the most, etc.  I'm just trying to organize everyone so we can be as effective and efficient as possible."
321,"I have a 3d printed bias tape maker that my wife posted on FB and now she's got a huge order of them lol. 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4234257"
321,"Finances haven't really been discussed beyond ""it's ok to charge the hospitals money to keep being to buy raw materials"".  Your case, you're charging money to keep people employed"", and I think that's reasonable.  You'd have to determine an appropriate price for what you're providing and approach medical facilities with an offer.

You can see who in the area has requested materials on GetUsPPE.org (Give PPE)."
321,"There are some face masks that have been approved by a medical review board on GetUsPPE.org, although not for directly interacting with COVID19-positive patients (ok for personal use or less 'hot' areas like shelters, etc.  PETG is the preferred printing material because it can withstand the sanitization process used by hospitals."
321,"I'm posting an update today.  It's been a crazy, intense time since I posted this.  Will probably be a new post. I've been organizing at the national, state, regional and local level, in that order of priority, so I haven't been able to get back to this group."
3dprinter,Not a pro by any means.  I bought my first printer 2 months ago - it is an Ender 3 Pro.  Couldn't be happier.  I did a lot of research before buying one and all the reviews seem to suggest it's your best bang for the buck.
orlando,"Yeah until this bullshit started I tried to avoid FB, but it IS good for organizing/collaboration.  You can sign up at GetPPE.org though. We're still working on the back end, but the end goal is that we will have the capacity match facilities in need of (that thing) with people can make or supply (that thing), as well as people or businesses who can supply raw materials for (that thing) with people can make (that thing)."
321,Got in touch with them - thanks!
321,We're still organizing that part.  Please be sure to join up at GetUsPPE.org as that will be the primary way we organize pickups and deliveries.
321,"Sorry for the delayed response.  I'm all over the place, organization nationally and locally and reddit's pretty low on the priority list.  I'm just now coming back to get a headcount of how many 3D printers we have.  I'll put you down - thanks!"
orlando,Company making straps and give them away for free: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfo5pkk74aF_kdo1qBwpVPhE-XaaRZirl4i1N1Kin9SLkAQXg/viewform
321,"I would urge you to sign up at GetUsPPE.org so we know who is producing what.  We have plans on the site for facemasks that have undergone medical panel review.  We are also building in functionality  that will match makers with places who need them.  Also if you're on FB, join the local group I linked in the original post.  We're coordinating local response as well."
pics,"Hey there - already got feedback on yours.  It's a no-go right now not because of the air gap (which is or isn't an issue depending on the facility), but because it's not wide enough.  13"" wide is the standard, 12"" is a minimum."
pics,Just edited my original comment.. hoping for a design improvement which would make this much more likely to be accepted.  I'm working directly with the medical review team and can get this fast-tracked.
pics,Submitting this for medical review by GetUsPPE.org!  Edit:  Lots of medical facilities are requesting a 'closed brim' or closed top see [this](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/27096-rc3-compatible-face-shield-for-08mm-nozzle-closed-).  Could that be done with your plan somehow?  Or perhaps we can get a CAD designer who can design a model for 3d printers that is just a 'cap' that snaps over the brim?
321,BTW - you should post these to /r/SlowTV

agedlikemilk,Bad prediction about Coronavirus impact.
Coronavirus,"Translated: 

The report of a famous singer of Vollywood has come positive. He is kept in isolation ward in Lucknow. She returned from London only a few days ago. He hid the victim of coronavirus and stayed in a big hotel in the city. There he also gave a dinner party"
Coronavirus,"Although this is a chinese newspaper.  But re: SK, I read recently that  the culture in North Korea is such that if you are asked a question by authorities, ""I don't know"" is unacceptable - you are expected to have an answer, so often times they'll just make something up.

conspiracy,"I'm not sure if you're joking but you make bread, which is just a combination of flour, water, salt and yeast.  You soak yeast in the water, this activates it/makes it come alive.  You mix the salt into the flour along with the water/yeast mixture, mix it all then start kneading it.  Let it sit on a warm countertop for a couple hours until it 'inflates', then bake it.  That's the basic, but you can do things like add in other ingredient, make different shapes, etc.

I went to the store last Thursday to top off my pantry because it was clear shit was going downhill fast.  I felt crazy because I was in semi-panic mode, buying canned goods, rice and beans, and everyone else is just casually shopping like it's a random week night."
conspiracy,"No, I bought what I needed.  I shop at Sam's club and it's just me and my wife - we still have like a 3 month supply of TP before this even started.  We normally keep a pretty full pantry because we like to cook and rarely eat at restaurants. At the grocery store I bought stuff we we were low on or that would last a while - canned vegetables, etc."

321,"* They're just about done building an exit on 95 between 192 and Eau Gallie which will feed to the airport via Ellis Road.  
* The west side of this intersection will loop down to meet the St Johns Heritage Parkway.  Not sure if that was started when you here, but it goes from 'very west' Palm bay on Minton, north to 192.  This section is complete and void of anything at the moment but I'm sure developers are licking their chops.  The portion that will go up to meet Ellis at the north end.  
* Since that road is completed, there's now an intersection with traffic lights west of that country/leather/boot store that was the only thing on the west side of 95.
* There is a huge complex planned at that intersection - apartment complexes and businesses - I'm guessing something similar to the Avenues in Viera.
* There is also a good sized shopping area on the west side of 95 at the Palm Bay road exit- not sure if it was there 5 years ago or not.  On the other side of 95 they're building more apartments.

And here I am, standing in a sea of people from my community.  Shit.

politics,"Yeah it came out when she announced her candidacy.  Apparently she has a pretty bad temper.  The story you're referring to was when she was at an airport with an aide - she was getting on a flight and had her aide go get her a salad.  The aide didn't get any utensils so she pulled a comb out of her purse and used it to eat the salad, then made the aide go wash the comb.  I still don't know how you'd eat a salad with a comb, but she made it work, apparently."

raspberry_pi,"Yes,  I've done that.  The issue does seem specific to Pi4 (or Buster), though."
raspberry_pi,"Hi all, I'm working on a project where I want to show lower thirds (or a 'heads up display') layered on top of video at certain intervals.  Using Pi4, 4 GB, Buster.

I've found a few tutorials online but some that worked on the Pi3 Jessie/Stretch no longer work on Buster.  

Ideally it would be something I could animate (like when you watch a documentary or the news and the info bar animates into place and/or fades in/out - but at this point I can settle on a static image.

Kivy was my first choice - by making a full-screen kivy app that sits on top of omxplayer, I thought I could go with the animation/fading route.  You're supposed to be able to make a transparent background with Kivy, but it doesn't seem to work on Pi4.  I can change the background color, but when I apply the alpha to anything less than 1 it's still 100% that color.

Other searches pointed me in the direction of DismpanX, but there are very few online resources for that and it's written in C which I'm not familiar with.. so that's a little over my head.

Then I looked into info-beamer, but the open source version doesn't work on Raspberry Pi, and I don't want to pay for their hosted service when I'm just making a little app for my own use.

I've also seen a suggestion to feed it a closed-caption feed but that's just plain ugly - I want to include some kind of graphics, be it a static image or animated effect.

I've pretty much run out of variations of ""raspberry pi video overlay"" so I thought I'd check here to see if anyone has any other ideas or has done something similar to what I've described above."
raspberry_pi,"By any chance do you have the camera module enabled in raspi-config?  I originally bought a webcam for the pi so enabled the camera module.  Didn't like that camera so I got a USB webcam.  Got the same error you're getting, so I disabled the camera module and after a reboot it worked just fine."

RetroPie,I know you posted this a while ago but I want to thank you so much - I'm not using retropie but am trying to get a video splash screen to work for days now.  It would always start to play but would end after a few seconds of playback and dump to a black screen.  After updating my settings with your .service settings it's now working as expected!  I nearly had a heart attack last night because I used the wrong settings and the pi stopped booting completely - luckily I was able to set up a raspi virtualbox on my PC to undo the changes.  Phew!
