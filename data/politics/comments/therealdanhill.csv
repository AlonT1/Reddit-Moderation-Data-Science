SquaredCircle,The fact it's dedicated to making fun of people should be an indicator it's toxic
SquaredCircle,"I dunno, it really seems like they are just beating people over the head with it too much. Get it, Bro-nuts? Get it, the Hardy Bros? Get it, Broetry in motion? I don't think it would be absurd for someone to think like ""Okay, yes, I got it weeks ago"", right? That's not an unfair opinion."

That argument can go on ad infinitum"

I mean, is that how you want it to be? Lying is shitty and shouldn't be normalized.

>why put so much effort into caring?

It's not really a lot of effort, most people are probably on their phone laying down in bed or on their couch haha"

SquaredCircle,"People wanted to see Sting in WWE for years, him and Taker was one of the biggest missed dream matches ever"
SquaredCircle,WEEEE ARE IN CONTROOOOL
SquaredCircle,"That's not what I said, or at least meant. If you take the typical archetype of what the average person considers a videogame streamer is and applied that to Miro, I don't think that would work as a heel act. I think there's people who could pull that off, sure- but I don't think it would be a guy who is naturally confident, who is in great shape and is a legitimate athlete, who is physically intimidating. Does that explain it better? I think that sort of character would be better suited for someone like a Peter Avalon. But, you know, opinions and all that."
SquaredCircle,"Nah that's the case against it haha, I don't think that would work at all, especially not for a guy like Miro who can be legit imposing"
SquaredCircle,"> Ok. So you run into this situation then. Miro gets enough wins under a month and gets to face Darby who JUST won the belt. Do you immediately do a title switch and make Darbys reign only a wasteful month or do you have Darby win and Miro goes back to do nothing and having less to fight for?

Idk why the title has to come into it for it to be good or to tell a good story. HBK/Taker wasn't for a title, Rock/Hogan, most of the Sting/Hogan build had nothing to do with the title"
SquaredCircle,"People that are like what his gimmick is IRL are generally perceived by a fair amount of people as just annoying. It's fine to play games, a lot of people do it, but when that's all you have going for you, it's not a great look or at all ""cool"". I'm sure a lot of us like video games but it's not the only thing we like or talk about.

Going further if his character is supposed to be a Twitch streamer, a TON of people find streamers really off-putting, if this wasn't the case you'd see these people having shows on Cable TV and doing good numbers, but you don't because it's a niche, making it into a wrestling character is a niche within a niche."

politics,"To elaborate (and this is in the wiki as well where we outline topicality extensively), we review each article for topicality based on the content of the article, rather than ""this article seems to be about X"".

So for example, if there was an article where politics were not discussed and it was just ""Donald Trump Jr. Tested Positive For Covid"", that would not be on topic as there was no explicitly mentioned politics in the text of the article, and Don Jr. is not an elected official. This article however goes into detail on the debates, which would make it on-topic. It's not exactly as simple as ""mods left a story about X up and took a story about Y down"", what matters is the content of each individual article.

If there are any questions about our on-topic rule, please feel free to send us a modmail and we would be happy to review or answer any questions you might have! It's a much better way to reach us if you are interested in a polite discussion or explanation as it's impossible for us to see every comment posted in every thread with the volume we're dealing with. Hope this helps and have a good night!"

VisageGame,"The real frustrating things is a more intuitive inventory system would have actually been easier I think. Look at a game like Resident Evil 7, and this game is way less complicated, it's not like you have to block or shoot anything in this. Visage is ridiculous in that just to do things with your hands, you have to work with 6 buttons if I remember right:

1. Hold in left hand
2. Hold in right hand
3. Use left hand
4. Use right hand
5. Swap hands
6. Put down

Imagine if using your hands IRL was like that!



And you can't even make the argument it's more immersive or realistic to have to juggle things hand to hand or individually put them away when you can have an item floating in the air front of your face while walking around because while it's ""picked up"", your character didn't pick it up, they levitated it."

You are questioning it and receiving a response right now and have not been banned, I think you may have misread my comment.

We take great care to purposefully not represent anyone and to operate as impartial agents, if you are looking for a subreddit that will operate exclusively in your or solely one group's interests, this is not nor will ever be it, just to be clear. It does not matter what side of the aisle a person stands on, if you are encouraging harm towards them you will be treated the same in any instance. There are likely several subreddit where this is not the case, you are of course free to post in those as well if our rules are not to your liking."

funny,There can only be so many managers...
SquaredCircle,[META] We NEED to TALK about the MODS of this FORUM
SquaredCircle,"You're not talking about black and white stuff, of course at points it's going to be up to the mods to draw that line when there are a variety of situations where people disagree if something is related enough or not."
SquaredCircle,"I think it's a fair take to not dig it, that sub is just abjectly pretty hateful and negative. It's not really a great thing when there is a dedicated space to make fun of other people by design, and by doing so it probably just makes what some people complain about worse. It sucks too that it feed into lumping a ton of different people into one basket, there's little room for nuance or reasoned conversation, it happens here a bunch too and it sucks."
SquaredCircle,How are you not allowed to think that tho
fantasyfootball,"Kelce's spot is cemented, you don't have anything to worry about"
fantasyfootball,oof
SquaredCircle,"I don't get this argument really. Yeah, the clothes are expensive but price doesn't have much to do with aesthetic. You could take a shirt and rip it to shreds and stain it and sell it for $1000, but a lot of  people would think it still looked bad, right? And it would be a totally fair opinion."
SquaredCircle,You couldn't have stated your opinion in a more civil and polite way and still got downvoted haha
SquaredCircle,"Unpopular opinion maybe but they just looked like pajamas to me, if I had a ton of money I still wouldn't dress that way just because I could but if he's happy that's what's important, I just thought a t-shirt and sweatpants wasn't a great presentation."
SquaredCircle,"I mean I thought it was a fairly benign opinion about scripted fighting, dunno where in my comments would make you think I'm not calm or that I'm being unreasonable. It's okay that you disagree with me about the segment on the TV show"
SquaredCircle,"I don't have a problem that he plays videogames or that anybody plays videogames. I play videogames. I am not over 50 years old. I do not have a problem with liking videogames. I never said any of these things and do not understand where this theorizing is coming from because it's actually pretty simple if you don't jump to the most hyperbolic conclusions immediately.

To me, generally when someone is in a wrestling ring, I want to suspend disbelief and believe they are a competitor there to beat people up. If someone is a great gamer, I do not see how that helps them win matches. It's like going to get a job at a bank and putting on your resume you are awesome at Street Fighter. 

It's great that he has a hobby he enjoys and it's great that other people enjoy watching him play games. Unless there's going to be.a videogame title defended in the right, I think ""I'm the best gamer"" feels out of place in the ring."
SubredditDrama,"They know they don't have a chance in handling it, that's why they are passing the responsibility off to mods and users. ""If you don't like it, engage with the content and speak your mind!"" and every time someone does reddit and the ad buyers get a clickity click"
SubredditDrama,"> You can't see the nuance...? 

You could have just stopped here"
SquaredCircle,">  I’m well aware how bright that fire burns inside her.

Are you now"
SquaredCircle,"Is that true though? Ricky Starks has been featured on every recent show, Jungle Boy is on pretty much every show, Sonny Kiss they are using more often. Cardona has had like one match right?

Luchasaurus, Santana and Ortiz, Penta and Fenix, Orange Cassidy, Darby Allin, Young Bucks, Omega, Page, Best Friends, MJF, Wardlow, just off the top of my head those people are on TV all the time and they aren't WWE-lite or whatever."
SquaredCircle,"I mean, I'm not new to AEW, just because it has happened before doesn't mean I like it or that I've had a problem with other instances. There are certainly other reasonable explanations than being new to a show, but even if I was new to it and didn't dig it, what would be wrong with that?"
SquaredCircle,"Why does it matter where he used to work? You don't go to Subway and see a guy that used to work at McDonalds and think ""All these ex-McDonald's guys are killing this Subway!"""
SquaredCircle,Yeah I dunno why it's sacrilege to suggest it wasn't a great debut even if you're a fan of the guy.
SquaredCircle,"I dunno about getting in the ring and saying what a great gamer you are in what looked like pajamas, and that hair haha

I appreciate that the guy has to reinvent himself and that's not easy but at the very least not what I was expecting"
SubredditDrama,Can you go more into the human review process you are using for these ads?
SquaredCircle,"I think it's kind of ridic that so many people would be totally cool with a bunch of volunteer anonymous internet mods making the decision _for them_, people who are presumably adults as the average user here is like 25-35, on what is true or not true. I can't imagine being so willing to pass off the responsibility of your own decision making like that."
SquaredCircle,"It has bright spots all the time. Of course there are some issues, there's like 200,000 people here, it's not going to be perfect and there's room for improvement. I guarantee the vast majority of people come here, they watch some wrestling gifs, make a couple comments, and go on about their lives perfectly content."
SquaredCircle,"I dunno maybe just use a modicum of common sense and know that just because you read it online or because it has some upvotes it might not be true, or is that too big an ask"
SquaredCircle,They are Tim and Eric mixed with Always Sunny haha
SquaredCircle,"A bunch of unpaid janitors aren't going to be able to fix the issues of sexism in the wrestling community, it's pretty unfair to lay such a burden on them when we're all responsible for it and calling it out when we see it. 

This is our community and we need to do the work to keep it the way we want it, which includes voting and decrying sexist rhetoric when we see it, and also reporting it. When I was a mod here, the vast majority of that type of stuff never even got reported, even when you'd see 3 comments replying to it saying ""the mods don't care"" or whatever and that sucks. We all need to do our part, there's hundreds of thousands of us and like 12 of them."
SquaredCircle,"If part of their gimmick is sexualization and that's made clear beforehand and they want to get that over, I think there can be a respectful way to do it involving a conversation of boundaries and such. 

To wish a woman was exposed against her will to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people in the moment is so far removed from that it's wild"
SquaredCircle,"I dunno if it's so much losing the filter as just not changing and getting set in your ways, and if that included not having a filter there you go. I guess you could add in being rich, respected, and famous within his industry."
SquaredCircle,What?
AskConservatives,"So, I guess I would ask do you believe that The Atlantic made up these comments that were then confirmed by separate outlets? That would be a pretty huge scandal."
SquaredCircle,"I thought he was ""cleaning up"" the junior heavyweight division"
SquaredCircle,"So, while I can understand the frustration, here's the example I use in this scenario.

A lot of people break the speed limit. If you drive a lot, you probably see it all the time. However, not all of those people get pulled over. Does that mean the law is useless or doesn't exist? Of course not, because over a long enough period of time, if you speed a bunch you will probably get pulled over.

You broke the rules and you got banned. You are responsible, as an adult, for your own actions, correct? What you are doing is the equivalent of being pulled over by a cop for speeding and saying ""but officer, the guy ahead of me was speeding too"", which, we know that ain't gonna work."
SquaredCircle,Insults are against the rules though so I don't know why you would be upset about being banned or like not agree with it. It also sounds like you evaded the ban by editing your comment after the ban.
SquaredCircle,"Ah, okay.

I mean, insults are against the rules so idk, it seems like you broke the rule? Or would you disagree with that?"
SquaredCircle,"> And just like humans, not robots, they should be held accountable and judged for their performance, should they not? That's what this is about. We shouldn't be critical of them because their feelings might be hurt? Come on.

Nobody said don't be critical, there is a long chasm between being critical and being like reasonable and having some perspective. No, mods of a forum dedicated to scripted fighting in underpants probably shouldn't elicit anywhere near the same vitriol people reserve for like, elected officials or judges or whatever, I think we'd agree on that.

the way you frame it it def feels more about the judgment than being constructive or speaking to people in a way that facilitates a respectful exchange between adults. Judging is easy, as is ""holding people accountable"" online given we're all anonymous and we'll likely never meet each other, it's a pretty nebulous thing that usually just boils down to witchhunting mods and thinking they should just _take it_ because hey, they chose to do it and they deserve to not be treated with any empathy.

>And idk if you're new here or what but there is generally a few ""what are the mods doing"" posts every other week. From unreasonable deletions to the saga that was anal_cavities, to everything in between. Deleting posts just to upload it themselves for the sweet sweet karma. It all happens, we all see it. Just because they are 'human with feelings' doesn't make them immune to what is essential peer review, because you are right, it is a hobby.

I mean no, I was a mod here for like two years haha, I'm not new here. Yeah, there are plenty of those posts. Anyone can make a thread about the mods, I've seen meta threads complaining about mods reach the front page posted by habitual ban evaders, real young accounts, or just general shit stirrers that were banned for legitimate reasons and held a grudge over it but everyone likes a ""DAE mods suck"" post, it's not just an SC thing it's a reddit thing. 

There are over 500k users here. Realistically a lot don't post anymore, so let's cut that in half and say 250k. If even one percent of them don't like the mods or have a grudge or whatever else, that's 2500 people that are able to make a hell of a lot of noise but putting it in perspective it ain't that much."
SquaredCircle,"The number of reports doesn't really matter with the way the report queue on reddit works, everything shows up in order from most recent report to oldest report; you can search by report amount (like 2+, 3+) but when I was a mod the queue was consistently clear either way so it didn't really matter if something had one report or five, if it was against the rules it was against the rules."
SquaredCircle,Maybe if your goal was making the subreddit better you wouldn't try starting a witchhunt and would instead start a dialogue between other human beings like adults and offer some constructive feedback or thought-out ideas for improvement.
SquaredCircle,"It is speculation, because users can't see reports on a post. SO many times modding here I'd see rule breaking stuff on the front page.. no reports, hundreds of upvotes. People think mods are like omnipresent or something but they rely on the community to help cultivate more than anything. It was so frustrating when there would be comments _in the thread_ saying ""why haven't the mods removed this?"" and nobody even bothered to report it."
SquaredCircle,Proof?
SquaredCircle,"Curious, what post were you banned for?"
SquaredCircle,_Everything_
SquaredCircle,"> Your post comes across as very ""mods feelings matter""

Jesus Christ dude they are actual human beings, they aren't robots. The things people say can hurt them just like anyone else, these are people with families and careers. Of course their feelings matter and I can't imagine anyone thinking otherwise.

>They should do their job, period. We don't need to make our own site, the site we have here, with 510 thousand people, is good enough. We need mods to use common sense here and be on the same page.

It's not a job for one thing, might seem like a small quibble it's important to clarify that terminology because ""job"" carries with it a lot of baggage. It's a hobby. Secondly, when you say ""we"", who are you speaking for? You said yourself, 510,000 people. How many of those people agree with you? How many even care? What if the ""we"" you represent is an extremely small minority of people?"
SquaredCircle,">If the brakes on a car don't work, no one cares about the fancy Bose sound system.

I think this is an overreaction. The ""brakes"" are fine, and maybe the wiper fluid is a bit low. Even the thread title is hyperbolic and isn't designed for any constructive conversation. Threads like this are a one-sided shitty mob beratement directed at people who actually spend a lot of their free time trying to help grow something they care about. 

I would bet my house and everything in it that the vast majority of people that have posted here really have no major qualms- they post/comment and go on about their day, maybe read some tweets and watch some gifs, and that's it. To say the brakes are failing as an analogy is more hyperbole imo."
SquaredCircle,"I don't know what this even means but I'm certainly not co-opting racist ""all lives matter"" bullshit for a joke on reddit."
SquaredCircle,"If this sub was a complete shithole, I disagree the subscriber count would climb especially considering before this sub there was another wrestling sub, and the reason people switched to this one was the old one sucked. 

It's really not that bad here aside from the overall toxicity of the userbase which I agree is an issue more needs to be done about, but like, look at the positives here. There's a guy who makes really cool themes for the sub for the big shows (who nobody ever really bothers to thank even though he works hard on them), there's threads every PPV, every weekly show, there's cool AMA's, the mods even did a month-long survey to have the users vote on the rules they wanted for the sub (and people _still_ complain about them), they did the census thing which was neat, ad overall this is still (I think) the best place online to discuss wrestling. Is it perfect? Of course not.

And like yeah, I've actually modded here so I know what it entails and I feel like I can speak to the fact these people work hard, people who have actual careers and lives outside of reddit, who give a shit what the users want and try to do the best they can and posts like these regardless of merit will always get upvoted to the front page because it's easier to jump on a ""fuck the mods"" train than recognizing even the faintest bit of positivity or actually making an effort to try to do this better. These threads all devolve into nonspecific hate-train complaints directed at a bunch of volunteers. If someone wanted, they could send a message through modmail, but the goal isn't actual constructive critique and working towards solutions, it's a bandwagon."
SquaredCircle,Didn't they literally do a months long survey and the users voted that they wanted tweets to stay?
SquaredCircle,"Weird how the subscriber number keeps increasing when literally anyone can make a subreddit and if this one was so bad people could just go there. Like, there's not a thing stopping anyone who is super invested in the meta of a professional wrestling anonymous internet forum from at least _trying_ to do a better job and if the mods are that awful it shouldn't even be hard"
SquaredCircle,You were banned from r/politics for personally attacking/insulting other users multiple times
SquaredCircle,"Hell yeah, I hope this means we see more of him!"
SquaredCircle,"What I don't get is they have all this room, why have everyone all bunched up? And then imagine there is a twitter post a couple weeks down the road of someone saying they got sick here, that would be a PR disaster and totally not worth it, especially not after the ""sloppy shop"" stuff."
SquaredCircle,"As much as I prefer wrestling with crowds, this seems mad unsafe"
ToolBand,"I've been looking too, too bad its gone and nobody saved it"
SquaredCircle,If reading something untrue on an anonymous internet forum and believing it because it has some internet up arrows  gets people so upset there's nothing any mod can do that will ever make them happy.
SquaredCircle,"Oh shit a whole hour? An hour is a real long time, it's 60 minutes!"
SquaredCircle,It wasn't BRAUN'S fault
TwoXChromosomes,"The women I work with are some of the most badass people ever, it's great!"
SquaredCircle,"For real, hope they get their shit together for it if they are intent on doing it"
SquaredCircle,Janna Ayyyy
SquaredCircle,This show has like zero energy
SquaredCircle,both
SquaredCircle,"This is kinda dumb, everyone looks like they didn't want to go to work today"
announcements,"I'd be happy to review that, got a link?"
pics,"> You’re right I have probably used the term “single dad” loosely and I’m okay with that.

Why?"
SquaredCircle,"It might for someone but that's totally subjective, as long as people are being civil isn't it better to not police discussion like that? If people like something, or don't like something, think it's great, think it sucks, they should be able to voice their opinion without being told to stay away because other people don't like what they have to say on either side."
SquaredCircle,"Or like, they can participate in them and offer their opinions as well"
SquaredCircle,"If having a biopic was the only considered element sure but I never said nor meant that, I've been consistently discussing television, commercials, and general over mindshare in multiple comments."
unpopularopinion,"I'm just asking you for proof of your claims and you haven't given me a single thing. You haven't given proof of your initial claim that people get banned for praising right-wing leaders, and now you're making another claim we ""suppressed Hillary content"" and I don't think you're prepared to offer any proof for that either. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a single example to discuss when if this is such a pervasive issue there must be hundreds if not thousands to choose from.

>To go further, let's say you were correct. Wouldn't it be at all strange that we allow many right-leaning sources to be posted? Wouldn't it be odd that we've hosted AMA's from Conservative politicians, influencers, and organizations? How would it make sense that a ton of people you'd likely consider on the left have been banned, and that many of them actively believe us/the majority of us to all be Republicans? I don't understand how you account for all that in whatever theory you have while still maintaining such a simplified overall view.

It's also interesting you didn't feel the need to address this and how it fits into your existing paradigm.

>The proof is out there

https://i.imgur.com/LFw8F.jpg"
SquaredCircle,"In Hollywood, yeah. Hollywood isn't the only thing that contributes to overall mindshare though. And hell if we wanted to bring Hollywood up, there's a Hulk Hogan biopic being made with freaking _Thor_, a lead actor in one of the biggest film and media franchises going today with Marvel and the director of one of the biggest and most acclaimed movies last year in Joker, that wouldn't happen if Hulk Hogan wasn't a huge deal."
unpopularopinion,"I have, I read the thread when it was posted ~3 months ago- ""just read the thread"" isn't really offering an example which, like I said, nobody really seems to be able to do. There are a fair amount of people who believe the Earth is flat, and when questioned will respond with ""just look at the science, do the research"" and that doesn't count for much in the way of proof, does it?

You have a strong opinion, or at least a formulated opinion on this, you must be able to find one example that's a smoking gun, right? That _proves_ a deliberate systemic bias? We've been a subreddit for over ten years, like it should be really easy. There are dozens of former mods you could go and ask _right this second_ about it.

To go further, let's say you were correct. Wouldn't it be at all strange that we allow many right-leaning sources to be posted? Wouldn't it be odd that we've hosted AMA's from Conservative politicians, influencers, and organizations? How would it make sense that a ton of people you'd likely consider on the left have been banned, and that many of them actively believe us/the majority of us to all be Republicans? I don't understand how you account for all that in whatever theory you have while still maintaining such a simplified overall view. 

If your theory were true, we would have to be geniuses or something  to pull that off with nobody who has been on our team saying anything like this for literally years."
unpopularopinion,Can you give an example? I'm not gonna expect you to drag out 50 examples or anything (though that would serve better to demonstrate a purposeful pattern of behavior rather than a mistake or mishap of training new people) but a couple would be great and I would be happy to look into them. I've been doing this over three years and I've seen a lot of claims like that made but when I ask for examples it seems like I never get any.
unpopularopinion,How so?
SquaredCircle,Or a very tiny show few people heard of called Hogan Knows Best
SquaredCircle,"The Rock is bigger right now, but in totality over time Hogan is the bigger name I think, you're talking like 35 years of people knowing who Hulk Hogan is. TV, movies, commercials, hell imagine how many kids got into fitness or bodybuilding because of Hogan and how important he was to that culture. 

Hogan may have never transcended or shed wrestling the way Rock was able to but that he _didn't_ do that and still became such a household name should speak volumes. And that was in a time predominantly before the internet and before there were hundreds of television channels."
unpopularopinion,"Of course it is, it's not like some secret the subreddit as a whole is left-leaning. The [overwhelming majority demographic of reddit](https://www.techjunkie.com/demographics-reddit/) is young, male, college educated liberals/moderates. I took issue with you saying I'm biased because that's not really fair but I appreciate you editing it out.

What you see on the subreddit is reddit's largest demographic manifested in the content, so I don't think it would be a huge shock to anyone. We would never claim the majority of users don't tilt towards one direction, that would be like pissing on your leg and telling you it's raining."
unpopularopinion,"You have no idea who I am or what my political leanings are. You've never met me, you've never (as far as I know) had a conversation with me, I am a complete and total stranger to you. 

Now, if you're comfortable making strong assertions based on zero actual knowledge, I guess nobody can stop you but generally (at least in my opinion) it's _probably_ a good idea to actually know what you're talking about before taking a strong stance on things."
SquaredCircle,I don't think that AEW going away or sticking around hinges on people on forums being assholes to each other about what wrestling they like or don't like.
SquaredCircle,"Okay but, we're not fighting it. We're fans, none of us work for these companies. _We're_ not in any war."
SquaredCircle,"Yeah I get that, but why do we want to be polarized, or how is it a good or beneficial thing? I don't get why we'd want to be polarized when we're all fans of the same thing at the end of the day and aren't engaged in a war or anything."
SquaredCircle,"I kind of wonder about this, like does it strike anyone else as maybe kind of toxic to get enjoyment out of other people not liking things? It comes off like people are salivating for it sometimes, I don't get that in this case because we're all here because we all like wrestling. 

It doesn't make me happy when other people are unhappy, or when they don't like things, at best it would just be indifference because different strokes for different folks, right?"
SquaredCircle,"Isn't it okay if people like what they like or have different tastes? Why does it have to be a personal failing if they have a different take? Instead of them taking it too seriously, maybe they just didn't dig it?"
SquaredCircle,"For me it's just like, the whole ratings war stuff is so toxic to wrestling fans, it presents such a shit dicothomy that makes places like this less fun, so playing into it just seems like it sets things back instead of the attitude that it's not a war and people can like multiple things or be cool about liking what they like or what others like."
SquaredCircle,"I mean, there are degrees and it's different for everyone to the degree they can suspend their disbelief, or find things goofy."
SquaredCircle,okay
SquaredCircle,"It's okay for people to like multiple things at once, we're not a part of a war"
SquaredCircle,Dude is drunk for a charity show
SquaredCircle,"it's okay for people to like things, it doesn't make them shills unless there is a transfer of funds or other personal favors."
SquaredCircle,This show doesn't really feel all that special so far
SquaredCircle,Alright I said earlier I wasn't excited for Sonny/Cody but the dance was worth it
SquaredCircle,"Comments like this don't make anything better, no offense, it just sucks that people can't just like multiple things at once, or if they only like one thing to be cool about it."
SquaredCircle,This card doesn't have me hyped except for FTR/LB and Mox/Cage. Nightmare sisters... eh. Janela seems like a step down from where Archer should be. Elite and JU will be fun I guess but there's no stakes. Sonny Kiss and Cody seems like a real styles clash. Maybe it could be a sleeper?
SquaredCircle,EVIL is the guy? Really?
SquaredCircle,I took the survey
SquaredCircle,Cracker Barrel!
pussypassdenied,"Wait, so the way to remedy that inequality is to celebrate a woman getting punched?

>you clearly haven't experienced what it's like to fight back in self defence only to be ganged up on or blamed as the bad guy even though you were just protecting yourself from a threat

Do you believe this is a common experience? If it's not, it would be silly to use that as an argument because of course they would be unlikely to have experienced that."
SquaredCircle,well that ending was a fart

Uno and Stu are basically sniveling lackies now, all the good work they did building them up kind of got wrecked with BL came in. They went from being corny when AEW started, to being redeemed, and now they are basically just on the same level as  the other Dark Order people, there's nothing special about them really."

samharris,How so?
samharris,"But composure doesn't change the facts of an argument, right? Someone who is very composed and entirely calm and detached can be wrong yet give the appearance of being correct through their composure, while someone agitated can be entirely correct but their arguments dismissed due to a lack of composure. I think it's more important to look at the content of an argument rather than the external posturing."
samharris,"Sure, but it isn't just urging people to be civil, it's decrying consequences for speech that he disagrees with based on his own subjective beliefs. Where he chooses to draw the line is arbitrary, it isn't based on data or anything and he seems to get a lot of praise for backing up his positions with data.  In a sense, by decrying consequences is he not infringing on the people who decide to enact those consequences?"
samharris,"Are you open to the idea it may be because it's not correct, rather than a sense of speaking unspeakable truths? I'm not asking if you agree- but are you open to it, and if so, how does that color how you process arguments for and against your positions?"

samharris,"> Part of Sam’s whole thesis (independent of BLM) is that we should be able to dispassionately discuss complex issues without fear of being shunned or losing our social standing our even our livelihoods. Is this an idealistic position? Probably. Is it unreasonable? Absolutely not.

Isn't it a fairly accepted argument that freedom of speech does not equal freedom from consequences? At an ultimate level would Sam endorse legislation where people cannot be socially punished or pressured for their views, and if not what is the end goal, because as long as there is speech there will be consequences for speech."

Some of his arguments were feels though, like Trump getting reelected when there's not really any polling showing that. He presents it as a possibility he is very concerned with but presents little to base it off of but his own reasoning. Or that in totality this is all a net harm to ""the left"", when he doesn't have much to back that up beyond how he feels about it. He presents a reasoning, sure, anyone can do that- but to point to a few examples like a person being fired or what some people on twitter are saying and use them to make determinations like that don't seem to be based on data."

There's nothing wrong with average, you could even say as a large forum and one of the more prominent ones average could work in their benefit in serving the most amount of people.

If an employer seeks to reduce an employee’s hours, but wants to make sure that they are eligible for the additional $600, the employer should schedule an employee’s hours so that the employee’s compensation is below the state’s weekly benefit amount.

>Larger subreddits are significantly more transparent with mod action. If someone is abusive, either ban them or take it up with the mods. The fact that you are so unwilling to have what actions are taken by specific mods is telling.

As someone who has modded what you would likely consider larger subreddits, it's just not as simple as you make it out to be.

It's literally an anonymous internet forum dedicated to scripted fighting, you don't think that's a bit ridiculous?

Most people don't even take that much time auditing their own elected officials (regardless of political affiliation), but when it comes to a forum, things like transparency and accountability get *real* important. Just an aside, something to think about anyways. 

>Threads about political issues. They still absolutely relate to wrestling, based on the how the moderators have enforced it. It is abundantly clear that ""related to wrestling"" means basically nothing, since the same post will be allowed or removed based on the time of day. But for some reason, threads that contain information that users should be able to see are removed by the mods, because it would start arguments in the thread. Either allow everything that involves a wrestler, or nothing outside of the shows themselves.

This is a generality though, this is not proof. Proof would be demonstrating the reasoning for a moderator action is what you are claiming, again proof is not ""I _feel_ like it's true."""
SquaredCircle,"> Letting mods here have unlimited power to ban/remove people or ideas whenever they feel like it without explanation/review/discussion is the problem.

Former mod here, just wondering how that's the case when the team actually enjoys a pretty wide variety of wrestling? Can you offer actual proof of ""bias""?

SquaredCircle,"> A. Any post that gets removed should specifically have a comment (not just a flair) about why it was removed.

You literally just said if they were wrestling related they should be left up, and if they aren't they should be taken down. Now they should all be taken down? Creating another problem isn't solving a problem, you've just taken away a piece of content that the subreddit wants to see.

>This is relevant how?

I'm trying to show you how there will never _not_ be inconsistency in this rule, and the complaints about inconsistency will always exist so long as the rule doesn't conform to the opinion of the users who complain the most about it. 

>This is a bad faith argument. Go to the weekly ZFFs, go to subreddit drama, and you can see what the issues are on these subs. They are not edge cases.

I mean, I've been spending a large chunk of free time I could spend doing other things in this thread trying to offer some perspective, and I'm glad to do so so long as it's civil, but what I'm not going to do is entertain accusations of bad faith when I know that to not be the case. I have no idea what subredditdrama or ZFF has to do with what I'm saying."
SquaredCircle,"> No, I wouldn't be. If the rule is wrestlers talking about wrestling, then all UUDD episodes that don't aren't up, and only the clips that do get posted.

But you can't do that, because if you left other episodes up, that would be inconsistent. You're looking at it from a view where you know on your end how the rule is enforced, you're not looking at it from the perspective of someone point that out in a meta post and it getting upvoted to the front page as yet another example of moderator inconsistency and bias, and now you're back to square one and have made no progress. 

>""So, just in the ring? A huge part of wrestling now happens on social media, so why wouldn't that be included?""

>>Yep. If you go with rule two.

Now you've pissed people off who think that social media angles are an obvious part of wrestling, which they are. You've maybe traded consistency in one degree for alienating a large part of the userbase.

>""What constitutes discussing wrestling?"" Wrestling constitutes wrestling.

This is a nothing statement. 

>Again, are you picking rule one or two. If you're picking two, then it wouldn't matter.

I offered those examples _because_ it would need to be objectively explained by the rule and applied to every instance. Those are part of your #2 rule:

>If your rule was It needs to involve a wrestler wrestling/discussing wrestling/discussing another wrestler

That is the second rule you presented.

>The options are broad rules that allow multiple things, or strict rules that require a great deal of moderation. We have mods that are selectively enforcing rules.

Again, because no matter what, the rule will always contain subjectivity because of the amount of edge cases, and every single one of those edge cases will be used to make a case for subjective enforcement or bias when a stand ultimately has to be made on them."
SquaredCircle,">Don't add to the tribalism, simple. He's literally the only mod I've seen participate in it

But it's not tribalism to just have an opinion. I didn't mean we all have to like everything, that's not feasible. What we have to do is respect that some people like certain things and other people don't, you can have opinions and you can even have civil debate and disagreement without making someone feel bad on a personal level or getting personal about things. If he or anyone was doing that, yeah that wouldn't be good but I don't know that to be the case.

>I made no claims, but if he's willing to be that biased publically then why wouldn't he be biased anonymously?

By making no claims you could also say ""why would he be"" and it would have just as much merit. And besides, by he very nature of you posing the question is making a claim to a degree, it's like asking someone ""when did you stop beating your wife?"" when you have no idea if they actually do."
SquaredCircle,"But those two categories are not mutually exclusive, there are things that fall into both, and that is the issue. You presented only two instances and think that because those two fit, it would be a consistent rule.

Let's take a wrestler tweeting to another wrestler about a something, a really common scenario where people say it should be removed for not being related to wrestling enough.

Your rules being:

1. Does this involve a wrestler

2. It needs to involve a wrestler wrestling/discussing wrestling/discussing another wrestler

Both of your criteria have been met in each rule.

Let's take UpUpDownDown as another example. That stuff seems to be pretty popular here, under your rules would that be removed because it's more about video games? Even though wrestlers are involved in it or talk about wrestling? What if there was an episode where wrestling wasn't discussed, would you remove that even though you allowed all previous UUDD stuff? Well then you'd be being inconsistent.

With the SuperPAC stuff, what if an article is discussing the financials of the McMahons, would that be not related to wrestling if it includes WWE financials and opinion on the outlook of the company? Could Vince be considered a wrestler as he's an on-screen talent? 

Let's break down your rule a bit more.

>It needs to involve a wrestler wrestling

So, just in the ring? A huge part of wrestling now happens on social media, so why wouldn't that be included?

>discussing wrestling

What constitutes discussing wrestling? Wrestling has a lot of aspects to it, that's a very broad, and again subjective, generality that gets the mods no closer to an objective, consistent rule.

>discussing another wrestler

Former wrestler? Current wrestler? In storyline or out of storyline as well? What _exactly_ constitutes discussing, a couple words? A picture? 

I get that you think this is really simple, but what I'm trying to show you is there are over 400k subscribers here who are all going to have a different idea of those things, and no matter where the mods come down on it there are always going to be people who will point to inconsistency when they apply a rule in a way a user or group of users don't agree with."
SquaredCircle,"Okay, so again, how would you write a rule objectively drawing the line between what is and is not wrestling related that can be applied consistently in every use-case?"
SquaredCircle,"Okay, let me break this down. Yes, people have opinions and preferences. Everyone does. What that _doesn't_ mean is that someone is using those opinions to inform the way they approach a situation. 

It's very frustrating because at least to me, this is something that should be common knowledge. Every mod likes the wrestling they like, that does not mean if they take action on a post or comment that they are doing so _because_ of their opinion. 

To add, what would you even be asking? that moderators who are fans of a company recuse themselves from acting on those posts/comments? No offense, but you know this is an internet message board, right? About professional wrestling? Don't you think that's losing the plot a bit? You're talking about a standard that _judges_ are held to and wanting to apply that to volunteer jannies on the internet. 

>who knows what he did/does with his mod Powers

Exactly, and this is the crux. What you have is a _feeling_. You don't know, you have no proof to back up your claim, yet because you have a _feeling_ you're comfortable forming a whole narrative based on next to nothing.

And hell, to go even further would you disallow people from stating their dislike of a company and their enjoyment of another? That's going to be like one of the largest contingents of opinion there is with regards to wrestling and always has been, even back to the territories. It would be absurd to make that a rule, but what can be a rule is not doing it in a way that is insulting other users, and unless he's doing that Skeach isn't breaking any rules by being a fan of what he's a fan of, nobody is. Someone is absolutely free to crap all over AEW, or WWE, or NJPW, you name it, even if people think they are wrong."
SquaredCircle,">Are you asking for the number of times I and other people have reported comments and its success rate?

Yes, I think that's an important aspect, don't you? You can't just form a hypothesis based on one side of the coin, right? If there were more reported comments that were removed or resulted in moderator action than there were comments where no action was taken, that would represent that on the whole most issues are dealt with appropriately. There would also be the question of if every report you're referencing is accurate, as from experience I can tell you that a large amount of reports if not the majority of them are for things that break no rules and the report is used as a ""super downvote"" button.


>The question isn't the rule. The question is enforcement. If the guideline was simply: does this involve a wrestler, then your post deletion rate drops. If your rule was It needs to involve a wrestler wrestling/discussing wrestling/discussing another wrestler, then your deletion rate has to be higher.

>But that's not what's happening here.

I addressed the inconsistency of the application of the rule. Of course it is going to be inconsistent, because it isn't an exact science. ""Wrestling related"" is subjective, it is not a mathematical proof like 1+1=2."
SquaredCircle,"Okay, so my question would be how so? Because I know Skeach, and they are a fan of all types of wrestling, so I'm curious where that notion would come from."
SquaredCircle,"> Actually I do take that in a bad way. I am referring to the number of times I have reported comments for abusive, homophobic and racial language and still found them up. I'm also aware that others are doing the same thing. So for you to handwave that as ""maybe 20 instances"" is an attempt to diminish that issue. Given my family and friend group, I do not look lightly at those issues. I'm sorry that you apparently do.

Okay, so how many have been reported and dealt with? Wouldn't you need to know that to be able to draw an empirical comparison? That's why I said it seems like you're taking a small amount of instances and are extrapolating it, and based on a subjective sliver of data as well. 

>But let's look at one larger example: Not related to wrestling.

I agree, that's a tough rule. The reason it's tough is because those posts are going to be different for everyone. Those posts are not black and white. We would always run into instances where a thread had a large number of reports for being not wrestling related- when we removed them, there was a multitude of complaints from users who disagreed. If we made a different call in another instance, the complaints were from the opposite side. 

Let me ask you this: Can you come up with an _objective_ rule about where exactly the line is for what constitutes wrestling related that can be applied consistently to every single instance, and where everyone can agree on it?

Of course it is going to be inconsistent, because it is not an objective thing. You cannot expect consistent application of a rule based on subjectivity- that isn't an opinion, it's a logical impossibility."
SquaredCircle,"Because most users are on mobile, and it's also trivial for people to disable css styling to unlock voting. 

On another subreddit, we actually worked with researchers at MIT to see if disabling downvotes had a positive effect on civility, and it turned out to be have no real difference. It was the best study that could be done under the circumstance of people being able to easily circumvent that restriction.  

Additionally, this subreddit has things in place that block users with very low karma, so removing downvotes would actually mean those accounts would be even more visible."
SquaredCircle,">  And as we look at what the mods ban here and what they let slide here, there is not consistency

What do they ban and what do they let slide? Considering that bans aren't public and that most users probably see a fraction of what mods see on the sub in a given day I don't know how you'd even go about measuring that to form an opinion based on analysis. I hope you don't take this in a bad way but you don't think it's at least possible that you've seen maybe 20 instances that come to mind over the course of years and are using that to inform a broad conclusion? 

>and neither incompetence or malice is forgivable.

Yeah, this attitude definitely applies to what I'm getting at. ""Forgivable""? It's an anonymous internet message board."
SquaredCircle,"> you would remove the upvote downvote feature

You can't do this, it's just a CSS hack that doesn't work on mobile where most users are viewing reddit and it can be circumvented easily by disabling subreddit styles. On another sub I mod, we actually worked with MIT to study whether disabling downvotes increased civility, and it was found to be negligible."
SquaredCircle,">It's simple. You want quell toxic behavior. Get rid of the people who are toxic. That is the best thing that can be done.

I think this leaves out a key element though, there also has to be an element of not responding to those people. I would tell people all the time, report and move on. Every time one of those accounts gets a response, they've been validated that what they are doing is working. Instead, people respond to those accounts with more comments that break the rules, and every time that happens it's actually preventing mods from getting to the comment that precipitated the response. The answer isn't just for the mods to do everything, there needs to be an element of the community helping out as well, because at the end of the day we all get the community we want based on our individual decisions and reactions."
SquaredCircle,And this comment is a perfect example of what I brought up in the OP.
SquaredCircle,"> So basically every individual has to moderate the subreddit on their own?

It's not the answer you want to hear, but _yes_, there is a degree of personal responsibility involved and users do have the tools to create a better space for themselves. One of those tools that go underused is reporting- the vast majority of the kinds of people you are talking about go unreported. One of those idiots can have ten replies pointing out they are a troll, or asking why the mods aren't doing anything, and yet not have a single report, I saw it all the time, every single day. 

Based on the activity level here, to make a space entirely free of toxicity or trolling or whatever, you would need a staggering amount of mods especially given that this is a hobby that people do outside of their real-life responsibilities like their job or their kids. You would need the community to do their part in reporting things, you would need them to do their part by not responding to those people with further rule-breaking comments. 

Further, the other user was right:

>It surprisingly doesn't take that many cause eventually you'll just realize that it's not hundreds of people being assholes but rather a few dozen who have nothing better to do in their life than to antagonize all day every day in countless threads.

At least people should be ale to acknowledge that those types of users are in the minority, and with that being the case, isn't that a good thing? I don't understand how anyone can make the assertion the mods are doing nothing or not paying attention when if you actually take a step back and look at it, that does appear to be the case.

>There’s literally someone making extremely racist comments in this very thread.

Keep in mind that mods can only get to comments after they are made, they aren't omniscient. The reality is, you are going to see bad comments. How many people go back after a while to see if they have been actioned Very few, if any. Your comment however will stay up forever, long after those comments have been removed. Nobody edits their comments to say ""Edit: Actually, it looks like they took care of them""."
SquaredCircle,"The automod message was actually my idea, and tbh it was one of the things that really made me want to stop modding here, the reaction to it. 

I looked at what other subreddits did and saw a relatively painless way to give people a reminder of our standards, and it would also work on the backend to assuage fears about being more strict with banning because we could always know it was very unlikely people weren't aware of our expectations, because everyone knows few people read subreddit wikis.

You would think we had killed someone. We got messages telling us to kill ourselves, we got these long screeds about how it was just too much to bear to have to scroll past a comment. Not that I wasn't a bit disillusioned before then, but that was what really sealed the deal. It was never meant to be a panacea, it would just a sensible change we could make.

The other part of that that got to me was the blowback from so many users that really did not want any kind of civility enforced because that would make the subreddit less fun or whatever, and that is actually a fair amount of people.

>Mods say they're taking applicants for new mods, 3-5 new mods join. One mod makes a dumb decision immediately, one mod does nothing, and the others are just in the background and you never see them. Rinse and repeat.

I guess for me, that anyone would even recognize that plays into the point I'm making, that investment in the meta. Take Skeach for example, that was a mod that you guys, I swear to you really made a positive effort to push for changes that would make this a better, more positive subreddit. But what happened? When he was a new mod, he made the wrong call on a submission, and that _one thing_ has followed the guy around for _literally years, even after he gave an explanation and apologized for it_. Like I'm sorry but that is nuts considering none of those people know the guy and it's such a stupid thing, to carry it around for that long and completely eschew the positive is just mind bending to me.

And it's no wonder there would be a cycle when that's the culture, when you sign up to try to make a community you enjoy better and it's just a matter of time until you're a target for whatever reason, and you can never shake that. It's also no wonder mods would want to stay in the background and just do the work, and hell isn't that what people want anyways?"
silenthill,"Dude that would have been perfect for pax, you should do it! When there is a pax again anyways"
SquaredCircle,"Okay, but there's so much you don't see from a user perspective. Unless you're tracking when each user who is reported stops posting, you don't know if someone was banned or not. You don't know how long someone was banned for. You don't know if someone is a chronic ban evader. You don't even know if someone was even reported, which the vast majority of those people aren't. 

There are unfortunately always going to be trolls on any platform like this. You're going to see them, the bigger it is or the more divisive the subject matter, there are going to be more of them. I know it sucks, but that's just reality. The mods can ban 100 people a day and you would probably never know it because you had never seen those people before, and more pop up in their place or they evade the ban. And then they come back and make a meta post about how the mods are awful and it gets upvoted to the front page, and nobody even thinks that hey, this could have been an example where the mods did something good and got rid of a toxic user and maybe they have an agenda behind posting what they are posting. 

>At a certain point it's not difficult to simply determine: ""Does this user add to this subreddit, or detract from it?""

This is entirely subjective though, and it's another thing people don't consider. There's not a clear demarcation line there, it doesn't exist, and there is always going to be an opinion on the other side that's a lot louder because people are so invested in the meta. 

You ban someone for that, well now you've banned someone for ""biased"" reasons. Now you have a bunch of pissed people going after you because they disagree with your call. It was the same thing for removing threads- a thread could have a bunch of reports for being not related to wrestling, but god help you if you remove it because there's a whole other contingent of people who think it is. People want clearly defined rules, but they also want the rules to be based on their own interpretation or they are terrible rules. They legitimately cannot win, no matter what they do.

Going further, it would be even worse to enforce topicality in comments. That's not how discussion works, it ebbs and it flows, it jumps around from place to place. And topicality isn't a clear line, it isn't the same for everyone. You'd be enforcing your subjective opinion of what contributes to enough of a degree to a discussion, and your interpretation is going to vary wildly from what another mod or another user thinks contributes enough. People _already_ complain about inconsistency, that would just add even more.

If you want to do it, apply the next go around, but I wouldn't recommend it. You'll be told to kill yourself, you'll be told you're garbage, you'll rarely get a shred of positive feedback, and any effort you try to put in will be shit all over by people who want this place to be what _they_ want it to be. I'm not a stranger to modding combative subreddits, I wouldn't recommend anyone sign up to mod here.

The whole reason I signed up to do it was because I had the same outlook- ""I'm going to clean this place up"". I thought after modding bigger subs, it would be easy. I'm not a genius, but I'm not stupid, and I'm not thin-skinned. It is an exhausting, thankless, toxic place to mod, and the only good part of it was that there are other people doing it that I could commiserate with who largely have the same goals I did."
SquaredCircle,Sustained.
SquaredCircle,"You can't mod your way out of a culture, or at least it would be really hard. I was a mod here, and after seeing all the shit they have to put up with I really wish people would give them a shred of assuming good faith.

I had a lot more to say on this but the page refreshed and I lost everything I typed, but I can go more in depth if people want, but I also don't think it will matter.

Just know that everything they do, no matter what action they take, someone is going to disagree with it, and that's always going to be the more popular and exciting point of view than taking into consideration people who agreed with it, and they don't have any pro ""x"" company agenda, and they spend a shitload of time trying to make this place better that nobody ever sees. It doesn't mean it's always perfect, and it can be better, but from my experience people hold them, a bunch of internet janitors, to a higher standard than they hold their own elected officials to, and tying it into the OP I think that represents part of the problem- being more invested in the discussion and the metadiscussion than actual wrestling."
SquaredCircle,"Sure of course, but you know the saying, every journey begins with a single step. Each individual can make more of an effort to consider that we're all here because we have a shared interest, and that's a cool thing! A wrestling forum is not going to change the ills internet discussion, but we can at least (I think) make a marginal improvement by just being conscious of how we treat other people within our community."

He played DND within existing campaign worlds. He riffed on video games and movies that had their own stories. I guarantee he sat down to write a script and just had no real ideas and hit a mental block."

We do everything we can to get users to follow the sitewide rules: we have them linked all over the place, we have this in our banner: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/flv4ef/a_clarificationreminder_of_our_rules_regarding/ and we even sticky it when we have space."
announcements,"> The banning of folks or removal of comments for expressing right-leaning positions is a great one, but likely more down to moderators of individual subreddits.

Can you provide examples of this on r/politics? I've modded there for over 3 years and have never once seen anyone banned or a comment removed just because someone disagrees with it, and if that _was_ going on any moderator doing that would be removed because we take that really seriously. 

I'm not an admin so I can't speak to their internal standards, I'm just talking about our sub. The comparison is often drawn between our sub and TD. The difference there is our mods do not approve content that is against the sitewide rules, we also don't promote content that is against the sitewide rules via our stickies or greenhatted comments. If we ever aren't sure, we make sure to ask them about specific things to make sure we're acting in accordance with their rules."
announcements,"> Absolutely agree and it's way overdue. It's basically ""if you ain't blue, fuck you"" and enforced by mods. 

Can you please provide one example of someone being banned for being a republican or conservative? It should be easy given the hundreds of thousands of bans."
announcements,"Hi there, can you please provide proof that we moderate in a partisan fashion? Like, actual proof, not just feelings. The users on aggregate being left-leaning does _not_ mean we moderate in a partisan fashion."
announcements,"Most of the comments in that screenshot weren't even reported, and the whole reason they use screenshots is because they know we remove the comments and they need to get to them before they are removed to freeze them in time."
announcements,"How many of those have been removed and how many users were banned?

It's almost like you have to use screenshots because the comments were already addressed."
announcements,Uh huh.
announcements,"Okay, please present proof of this and not feelings."
announcements,"Feel free to send us the links in modmail and make sure to report them. I just looked at the first screenshot and that user was already banned earlier. It takes us time to work through our report queue as we get thousands of reports a day.

Also note (and this is obvious but just in case) something being on our sub doesn't mean it's ""allowed"". Speeding is against the law, yet people still do it, that doesn't mean it's ""allowed"". I would bet we issue more bans than most other subreddits, even those larger or more active than ours.

Edit: Also, keep in mind bans are not public, so unless you are checking every user multiple times in a day (which I doubt you are, but I could be wrong), you have no idea what action was taken, as evidenced by someone you sent a screenshot of already being banned, and the fact you had to make a screenshot at all before the comment was removed as you must have figured it would be."

announcements,"What do you mean training? It's an internet forum, we're literally volunteer janitors on the internet, I'm not sure what training you're expecting. We do have training material for onboarding new moderators."
announcements,"Well, I'm not sure how repeating what I typed back to me in lieu of having an argument with any factual basis will help your case. 

It can be frustrating, because obviously this is something we hear quite often, as any mod team does. Nobody ever does anything wrong, if people are banned it is never due to them breaking the rules, there is always some grand agenda at play that makes them the victim. They never have to take responsibility for their actions, and they never have to _prove_ any of the claims they make, they just have to _feel_ them really strongly.

I hope I've been able to help shed some light on this, if not for you than for anyone else reading. Stay safe out there and have a great evening."
announcements,"Tell you... what? You were given a reason for your ban, as you linked in your ban message. You just don't agree with it? I mean, I would not expect you to, most people do not like being banned. Let's go over your comments and see how they break our rules.

>what a surprise, a male sanders supporter trying to convince people of his concern for women's rights as a defense to having been called on ascribing a predatory, sexual motive to behavior that he has forwarded in an attempt to baselessly smear a political opponent regardless of whether it trivializes genuine predatory behavior or that he knows appears not to have been motivated by such.

Yes, our rules are strict. Yes, they are more strict than a vast majority of subreddits. It's okay if you disagree with it or don't like it, I'm sure a lot of people don't, but we make it incredibly crystal clear what our expectations are and link them all over the subreddit and in every thread.

>It's important to mention here that we don't censor people due to their opinions. People are completely allowed to post an opinion that is not factually true, or that you believe is incorrect, or that you find unacceptable for whatever reason. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions even if you disagree with them - in these instances, remember to debate civilly and focus your efforts on explaining why you disagree. Attack the argument and not the user.

>It doesn't matter how ""well-written"" the comment, if your insult is sarcastic, ""creative"" or absurd, personal attacks are always against our rules. Name calling, ad-hominem, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments directed at other users are not allowed.

>An honest question deserves an honest answer. Go ahead. Ask an honest question. I’ll wait.

This is a violation of our civility policy: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_no_personal_attacks"
unpopularopinion,"> It’s clear you have a very subjective definition of civility.

I mean, sure, civility isn't mathematics. Of course if you want to boil it down like that it's going to always be subjective, but we even go out of our way to make sure people know our expectations. They are linked in the wiki, at the top of every thread, on our sidebar, there is [even a sticky right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/flv4ef/a_clarificationreminder_of_our_rules_regarding/) about it. 

>Selectively choosing which users to ban based on comments that your mod team deems as incivility simply creates plausible deniability when you purge opposing views.

We don't do this. If something is reported, and we see it, and it breaks our rules, every user gets the same treatment. Sure there may be instances where like someone is on mobile and can't ban because they can't leave a note or like a misclick or whatever but we work really hard to enforce the rules the same way regardless of the user. 

>How is it that the user that directly attacked and called me derpie is not banned? Yet, my comment that flips the attack in a much less direct way makes your list of a bannable offense?

I just looked, and it's because you never even reported it, as you can see here: https://imgur.com/a/5exs02w

We get something like 100,000 comments a day, there's like 50 of us, we can't be in every thread at every time, it's physically impossible. Like any other subreddit we rely on user reports to bring things to our attention- if you don't report it, the chances are we will never see it. It even says in our wiki multiple times that if someone else is breaking the rules to report them and move on, not to break the rules in response.


>You can pretend that it’s so difficult to know someone’s political leaning. That’s disingenuous. Simply look at a user’s post history before banning them. If they’re on your team, then they get a pass like every single user that directly shits on Bernie or Trump supporters.

Like I can't stress enough, we read thousands of comments a day, we really don't care what your politics are, the only thing we look for is if something is against our rules. Hell if we took the time to research everyone we'd never even get anything done. It's just not possible. And what would you say about the ton of left-leaning people who receive bans as well and go on left-leaning subreddits or are constantly in our modmail saying we're all conservatives? We literally hear every day from all sides of the political realm how we're biased against them, and that's because we take action on all users.

You're presupposing we do this but again, your position is based entirely around feeling. I can give you objective truth all day long but nothing I say is going to change an ingrained feeling so I don't know what to do. If you want to believe that's what's going on and you're comfortable having that opinion with no numbers, no examples, what could I ever possibly even say to change your mind?

>Edit: BTW happy cake day and thanks for at least replying with an answer even though we are in disagreement

Thank you, and you know what it is? Imagine seeing every day, a dozen times a day, ""You're all liberal shills/You're all Conservative shills"", ""You just ban Democrats/You just ban Republicans.""

It gets kind of frustrating because both of those can't be true at the same time, nobody ever gives examples when asked, out of the hundreds of thousands of bans we have done nobody can even cite one example, out of the dozens of mods no longer on the team not one of them has said this is going on, yet everyone still holds their opinion with an absurd degree of certainty based on nothing but feeling."
unpopularopinion,Alright well if you find it let me know but I didn't see anything like that and I highly doubt just a picture would be submitted as we block links to things like twitter and imgur.
unpopularopinion,">It really seems like you all starting to purge users that don’t share the same political views as the mod team.

It may *seem* a certain way but that doesn't make it true. 

I'll ask you this: How many left-leaning users do we ban? It's rhetorical, because you don't know. You're making an assumption based on personal feeling. 

Let me ask another: What if (and I do mean *if*, because I don't know) the amount of users of one political leaning broke the rules more than another in a given timeframe, even it being as short as a day? Should we hold off banning people until the scales are even for that period? 

Another: How do you believe we even know anyone's full nuanced perspective on politics? We couldn't possibly take the time for each mod to determine if a user's political philosophy aligns perfectly with their own. 

Another: We are a team of around 50 people, why would you think we are all perfectly ideologically aligned?

Another: With the attrition rate of how hard the subreddit is to mod, we have gone through likely hundreds of mods. Why has not one of them come forward to say that there is a concerted effort to ban right-leaning people? Like, that would be a pretty big deal don't you think?

Another: Why would we allow right-leaning content *at all* if that was our mission.

Like, I'm just saying please try to consider Occam's Razor here. If you have proof, by all means share it. What you're offering isn't proof of anything but you disagreeing with a ban and extrapolating that to some unproven systemic bias. 

>Sorry, being a sexual predator isn’t a spectrum. It’s binary unless you want to defend the indefensible. Then I think you’ve got your own derps to address.

>You keep proving it each time you repeat yourself. Just like the MAGA cult. Cover their ears with their fingers and cry fake news

>You’re so awful at this lmao

>I’m sure the private entity has no influence on their own election process. How naive are you?

You were banned because you consistently chose to break our civility rules. These are not even every example. You're right, we are not going to list every example when there are so many of them because our rules are incredibly clearly written."
unpopularopinion,"I don't mod r/news so I can't speak to how they mod their subreddit. For r/politics, I can say we've probably issued hundreds of thousands of bans, I would be interested if you (or anyone) could provide proof that even _one_ of them was done on a partisan basis. If that was found to be happening by any mod, they'd be removed from the team, I get that people are going to have their opinions or whatever but it's something we take seriously, probably moreso than any subreddit.

Like, these are human beings, with mothers and fathers, siblings, maybe children, just doing their best to get by the same way any of us are.

>Okay, you removed it 11 days and 33.7k upvotes later because you got called out for it. Surely multiple mods have seen a post as large as that a few times, and probably saw a couple reports on it. It should have been labeled off-topic a while ago, tons of comments on there are calling it out and I am sure people reported it.

We were notified of an incorrect action and corrected it, and we appreciate that most users are reasonable people who recognize we are humans, not robots. 

If one submission 11 days ago out of the 1000+ since then is enough to instill a realization that the subreddit is as bad as you claim it is, or represents enough rigorous analysis to justify the claim, we will just have to do our best to soldier on, that opinion non-withstanding.

> So why was this one, where Obama apparently condemns purity tests in politics, labeled off topic?: https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dp4eue/barack_obama_calls_out_woke_culture_and_twitter/

That article is moreso dealing with culture, not mentioning any opinion within the article regarding any specific policy, legislation, or on-topic material. From our wiki:

>This means that if a subject has political implications but is not directly related to US politics, or if an article contains only a small portion of political relevance it may be off-topic.

Also, in the section labeled ""Why was my post removed as off-topic?"":

>Stories regarding ""politicized"" topics without a significant discussion or focus on politics (ex. gun violence, income inequality, environmental concerns, or otherwise off-topic crime stories.)

_____

>Why was every single post about Project Veritas exposing CNN for having a vendetta against Trump labeled as off-topic even though it is about a media outlet showing bias?:

From our wiki:

>Moderators make topicality decisions based on the content of each individual article, not article headlines or stories as a whole. When there are multiple posts regarding a single topic, those submissions may be deemed on or off-topic depending on the content of each.

I cannot speak to general stories as a whole, it would depend on the content of each individual article. Regarding this: https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dihqwv/project_veritas_exposes_cnns_personal_vendetta/, that is covered in our wiki under ""Why was my post removed as off-topic?""

>Discussion of the media and law enforcement agencies/military actions that do not contain a significant focus on politics in accordance with our on-topic scope (e.g. Website analysis of Cable Network host or article, police officer charged with murder)

---------------------

>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/erxx8y/ilikebernie_trends_after_hillary_clinton_says/ - Seriously? No shit the people who use Twitter like Bernie, this is not related to politics at all. This is the same as a random guy in Kansas saying he still like Mitt Romney, it means nothing.

Please understand that we do not moderate article based on titles, or what it _seems like_ a submission is about. We read the articles when they are reported, and make determinations based on the text within to determine topicality. The following would make that article on-topic:

>Despite Clinton's criticism, Sanders is a clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with the latest data from Morning Consult showing that he has the highest favorability of all candidates in the primary race. Sanders is viewed positively by 76 percent of voters, while former Vice President Joe Biden is viewed favorably by 71 percent. Senator Elizabeth Warren comes in third at 65 percent.

>Meanwhile, only 17 percent of respondents said they had an unfavorable opinion of Sanders, while 22 percent had an unfavorable view of Biden. Warren was viewed unfavorably by 18 percent.

>Additionally, Morning Consult survey data from the fourth quarter of 2019 showed that Sanders was the most popular lawmaker in the Senate. Sixty-five percent of respondents approved of the progressive senator, with only three other senators having approval ratings above 60 percent.

As polling data has always been on-topic. 

-------------------------------

>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ewgd28/arrestrandpaul_trends_on_twitter_after_he_walks/ - People who dont like someone want him arrested? Wow who wouldve guessed, such big important news.

We do not judge what articles are important or not important. We do not determine topicality on that basis, we leave that to the users to vote on or comment as they see fit in support of or against the content of a given article. 

-----------------------------

>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/f26dhr/firechucktodd_trends_after_msnbc_anchor_quotes/ The same user base that favors Bernie started a hashtag to fire someone for calling them out.

I do not know what you expect me to do about what opinion you believe a userbase holds, but we reviewed that again and agree it's off-topic and it has been removed, thank you for bringing it to our attention.

I asked for specific evidence of your claims, and offered to provide counterexamples. I already understand you have a feeling that we as mods are biased.

Furthermore, no, of course _the subreddit_ leans left. I don't think anyone would dispute that there is a fairly obvious consensus that has arisen among users, as all subreddits tend to accumulate as they grow. That however does not mean that as moderators we take action on any content differently, you are conflating two separate things.

If you have evidence of moderators acting outside of nonpartisan parameters please send us a report, we take that seriously."
politics,"Both our rule and the sitewide rule are apolitical, can you explain how you arrived at that translation from my comment?

If you are of the opinion we moderate that sort of content regarding republicans/conservatives in a different manner than all others, I can easily offer you hundreds of examples to the contrary, if you're interested."
politics,"We discussed it due to reports flagging it as such, however the article makes it pretty clear beyond the title it is advocating for political change through legal means:

>If we don't get our shit together and drive him from office at the ballot box in November, we'll lose this one, too.
