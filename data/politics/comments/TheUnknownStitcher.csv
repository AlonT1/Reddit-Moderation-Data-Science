politics,"Close-ish. The core story itself (governor strong-arming a scientist through the use of police agents) is on topic, but prior submissions lacked any connection to the political aspects, and were therefore 'off topic'. I understand that it can seem silly, but if every story with political connections was allowed into the subreddit, we would be absolutely inundated with all kinds of inherently non-political submissions. 

Because of that, one of the key elements of our topicality requirement is that the article itself explicitly focuses on US politics. A single mention in a paragraphs-long article sometimes isn't enough, especially of the focus of the article is on an unrelated aspect."
politics,"This submission meets our topicality requirements and will not be getting removed as being off-topic. 

As I explained in a few other comments, the previous articles focused entirely on the raid and lacked explicit connection to the actions of politicians. While still important as a story (and a deeply upsetting and dangerous one with regards to showing how much certain politicians are willing to do to hold onto their power and status), they lacked explicit connections, which are required to meet our topicality standards."
politics,"The story is on topic. Previous submissions lacked direct connection to politics. 

As I explained in another post, I think it is an important story and I am glad that one came through that fell within the boundaries of our topicality requirements. All of the previous ones that I read were entirely focused on the raid and lacked explicit mention of or connection to politics."
politics,"I'm glad a submission came through that met our topicality requirements. Previous articles I read about this story, while extremely important and troubling, lacked any direct connection to politics. 

We get a tremendous number of stories that are important, but we also have a narrow scope with regards to topicality. Previous submissions were entirely focused on the crime, and if any article with implied connections to politics were allowed to be submitted, then it would be impossible to draw a line in terms of what stays and what goes. 

This submission is staying, and I am truly glad that it is - because this is an important story. 

And while I know people will not believe me, there is no grand conspiracy to bury stories or spin narratives. I'm just a person like all of you, and I'm working within a ruleset in terms of what falls within the territory of topicality."

politics,"Any time a submission is found to include hate-speech/racism or dangerous content, our mod team acts on it and removes it. The majority of submissions from these domains do not break r/Politics' rules. If you come across submissions that are in violation of our rules, please report them and our team will action them as soon as we can."
politics,"While you are not alone in expressing that sentiment, there are many r/Politics users who use those sites for their news and who submit on-topic stories from it on a regular basis. Removing a site from the Approved Domains list is not a decision that the mod team makes lightly, but we do look at the submissions coming in from websites and have ongoing conversations about their presence on the subreddit."
politics,"The users are largely responsible for which submissions get seen and which ones do not. Celebrity endorsement of candidates or comments on political topics are often within the scope of our topicality rules, and users are free to upvote and downvote submissions as they see fit. 

I will always encourage users to avoid clicking on content they do not want to see."
politics,"Anger toward a politician is understandable and permissible here. 

Openly celebrating their death or illness (or wishing for it or going out of one's way to make a snarky 'indifferent' comment about it) is in violation of r/Politics' and Reddit's rules."

The lack of a true 'third option' and the ""known"" status of both Trump and Biden has really reduced the number of third-party and undecided voters. I don't think the election results will be all that far off from what high quality polls are showing. 

Ranked choice voting would be great."
politics,Nothing about blaming the administration for their handling of COVID is against the rules of r/Politics.
politics,"Yes, our mod team has been in communication with admin about awards abuse. We are unable to determine which awards are available for purchase on our subreddit, but multiple posts have been made by mods from other subreddits expressing similar concerns. 

As of yet, admin has not made any substantial change in the awards policy. Any back-end account tracking they're doing has not been communicated to us."
politics,"To quote from the FAQ on this metathread:

> Q. ""There are websites on the approved domain list that I don't think should be there. Why can't we remove them?""

> We use a 'domain notability' requirement, which ensures that any domain that was sufficiently influential or remarkable is permitted. There are many domains that we receive regular complaints about due to content that may be inflammatory, controversial, or spurious. The fact is that we were very actively trying not to target those domains when moving to this system. We want to make user voting, the core mechanic that all of Reddit is based around, the primary method of curation on our page.

> Please try to remember: inclusion on the approved domain list is not an endorsement by the mod team of r/politics, or a reflection of reputability. It is solely reflective of whether the domain is notable."
politics,There isn't a single source we have here that hasn't been reported numerous times. Are there specific domains you have in mind with regards to your concerns?
politics,"It is not uncommon for high-quality reporting from submission sources with a longstanding history of credibility to receive dozens of reports ('this is misinformation', 'spam', 'mods need to remove this garbage', etc) simply because users are unhappy that a story has been submitted to the page, despite the submission being completely within the scope of the subreddit and not having broken any rules. 

If we ever see submissions that are utilizing hate speech, promoting violence, or breaking other r/Politics rules, we will remove them. If a domain has a clear and consistent trend, we will discuss taking further action as a mod team. Removing a domain is not something that we to lightly or without extensive documentation to support our decision, because while it may please a large portion of our userbase, it will inevitably upset users too."
politics,"Perhaps I have lost the thread of the conversation - but it appears that your criticism is that the mod team removes rule breaking content, and you would like us to keep it on the page if it has received upvotes or been on the page for a certain length of time. 

We will not allow rule-breaking content to stay on the page just because of its age or popularity."
politics,"Ah. Well, the same general idea stands. It's possible for the mod team to access the modqueue without going to the front page of r/Politics. If something hasn't been reported by users or caught by our automod, it's legitimately possible that we just haven't had a chance to get eyes on it before it generated a lot of upvotes. 

As mentioned in the FAQ of this thread, it isn't uncommon for us to receive *thousands* of reports a day. As much as we would like to be able to action every item within minutes of its getting reported, it isn't something we're able to do with the current volume of traffic we are seeing.  

The key takeaway though is that rogue-removals of submissions are not a thing that happen. Even though we don't take a submissions score or awards into consideration, we do make sure to give them a close team-wide look if we're in a position where we are removing something that has generated a lot of activity."
politics,"Our mod team cannot see data about users who upvote rule-breaking comment, so that would have to be something completely on the administrative-end of site operations. 

We also cannot see which users awarded posts. We have brought concerns about this to the administrative team, and we remove awards that are given in a rule-breaking manner."
politics,"Thank you for the kind words!

The mod team has conversations regarding the topicality of submissions on a regular basis. I mentioned this in another comment, but topicality is sort of a nebulous grey-zone at times. Back in March, we had a lot of conversations about whether or not submissions about individual politicians self-quarantining were on topic. My oh my how times have changed. 

Topicality is especially difficult with stories related to crime, protests, and the actions of agencies like ICE. In order to stop r/Politics from turning into a general r/News catch-all, we have to use a narrow focus, as is explained in our [topicality statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement). However, nothing is perfect and we often have to look closely at a submission and determine whether or not it fits into the spirit of our criteria. 

As for whether or not this subreddit influences politics - I'm not sure that it's something that we've really taken into consideration. A lot of the time, it really does feel like we're just a small corner of the internet where people come to talk politics."
politics,"Any time a mod has to action a comment that has been approved by another mod, it gets brought to the team and discussed. It is not something that happens unilaterally. 

The two main culprits are either the content being buried in the reports queue or not being reported at all. With some comments wishing death or violence on politicians, it might be hours or even days until someone reports it into our queue. Even if the comment's sentiment aligns with the wishes of users who have upvoted it, rule-breaking content has no place on the subreddit and it will be removed."
politics,"It's definitely something that we had *many* discussion about as a mod team, especially during the start of COVID's spread in the country and during the summer BLM protests. Even with our definition, topicality can be a bit of a nebulous grey-zone, and we are still having ongoing conversations about what is and is not off topic."
politics,"I feel like some of Reddit's site-wide changes may have impacted the size of the troll footprint. With the quarantine and shuttering of certain subreddits and the implementation of some new policies, it does seem like the number of trolls has decreased. I can't speak to what it looked like from a mod's perspective in 2016; but I can say that looking back with a general user's perspective, I do think there has been a decline."
politics,"One of the challenges we've had to work with lately is a queue that is slammed with inaccurate reports. Many users use reports for items they disagree with, even if the content is not rule breaking. Each of those reports has to be actioned by our team, and even if a lot of them wind up being approved to stay, they get in the way of actual rule-breaking content that we need to remove. 

With some of the recent news stories about politicians and COVID, comments that violate r/Politics' and Reddit's sitewide rules regarding death and violence have attracted upvotes and gildings. We do not take a comment's score into consideration when removing it. 

The same can happen with submissions and topicality. We often tell users that stories are ""political, but not politics"" - and while we understand that such a policy can be frustrating, especially after a fair amount of discussion has taken place in the comments, we have to keep a focused approach in order to keep the subreddit manageable."
politics,"This is something that we rely heavily on user reports to help us with detection. We will be discussing adding a 'Broken' option as a report option. In the meantime, we would encourage all users to submit a custom report telling us that the link is dead and we will be able to action it once it's in our queue."
politics,Thanks for your suggestion on this. Age gates are part of an ongoing conversation on our mod team and this is something that we will be continuing to explore.
politics,"A concern with this is that it would make it even easier for users to be uncivil to each other based solely on the age of an account. We already see a lot of comments where users are attacking each other based on their newness, and this wouldn't help with that. 

We do have certain age gate systems in place, but it is certainly something we are continuing to discuss as a mod team."
politics,"To add to what Q said - it's sort of a double-edged sword with the news cycle we're living through. We have a lot of people who never cared about politics until recently, and we don't want to shut them out from the conversation - but there are also a lot of people with nefarious intentions, and finding a way to reduce one of those populations without negatively impacting the other is easier said than done."
politics,......how did I not think of this play on words until now?
politics,"It's something we talk about a lot, and it's tough trying to find the balance between keeping out bots/sketchy accounts and making sure that this is a place where users can come discuss politics. 

With the number of major political stories that have happened this year, there's been a huge uptick in the number of people who are paying attention to/interested in politics. A very real downside to an aggressive age gate is shutting out those users. Also - with it being an election year, there's a lot of new voters with questions and thoughts."
politics,"Thank you! It's been far busier than any of us thought it would be when we joined the team. I always thought 'FOMO' was just an exaggerated thing; but these past few weeks, I feel like I'm going to miss some huge story if I step away from my computer for more than a few minutes."

movies,"The people defending the ""artistic choices"" in this movie are the same ones who sit back and defend Jodorowski's rape allegations from *El Topo*, Chan-woo Park's repeated takes of an actor eating a live animal and making it suffer in *Oldboy*, or Stanley Kubrick's abuse of Shelley Duvall during *The Shining*. 

At a certain point, the cost of suffering or exploitation has to be taken into consideration, and sitting back as a viewer and saying ""it's worth it"" while pointing at the screen from your comfortable surroundings completely ignores the experiences of the victims. 

It would be completely possible (and some may even say *more* artistic) to depict the sexualized behavior of the dancers in *Cuties* without showing it. Show audience reactions. Use angles that show the children from the neck up. Do anything other than place the camera inches from their pre-pubescent bodies while having them writhe around. 

Yes, I understand that nuance exists and that when viewed ""in context"", things might not be as bad as they look when viewed in isolation. But guess what? Making something that can be viewed out of context by people with nefarious intentions is still pretty shitty, even when viewed from a place of artistic thinking. It would be like if *Lolita* went into explicit and erotic detail about a sexual encounter between Humbert and Dolores just to say ""see, it's fucked up, right?"" 

I don't need to slowly torture an infant to death on screen to make a point about how torturing infants is fucked up. If the director of this movie is truly as basic as having to do/film the thing they're trying to make an ""artistic statement"" about, then they need to get into a different line of work - because they're actively harming people with what they're currently doing."

And if you follow your truth down the road to peace and the affirmation of love, if you shine like a beacon for all to see, then the poetry of all the great dreamers and philosophers is yours to manifest in a nation, a world community, and a Beloved Community that is finally at peace with itself.”

politics,"Some frequently asked questions:

**Is there a live stream I can watch?**

-Nope. I recommend looking up #SCOTUS on twitter or following SCOTUSblog's live coverage. 

**When will we find out -Insert case here-?**

-We'll find out when we find out. The court does not signal which cases are being announced ahead of time. 

**Why is the court waiting to announce their opinions?**

-Their schedule of hearings was disrupted by COVID-19 and opinions take a while to write. Some may still be in the process of being written.

**When will the court be finished with announcing their cases for this term?**

-Traditionally, all opinions have been announced by the end of June; but because of COVID, announcements may spill over into July. 

**How many opinions are getting announced today?**

-Not sure. Might be one, might be the remaining number. There's a 10-minute interval between opinion announcements, and cases are released in reverse-seniority order with regards to the authoring justice. This can help give a loose estimate of whether or not more cases will be released today. (Example: First case released is authored by Gorsuch, it's possible that others will follow. If the first case released is authored by someone like Roberts or Ginsberg, it is less likely that other cases will follow.)"

**Why not release all opinions today?**

*It's possible that some are still being written.*

**How many opinions will be released?**

*The only way we know how many opinions will be released is when the court announces that they are done with today's batch.*"

we must decide whether an employer can fire someone simply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer is clear.

politics,"The justices vote on the cases and then they have to write them up. Those then have to be revised and edited, and justices may change their vote after thinking about it and talking it over with each other."
politics,"You're welcome! It's possible that they've all been voted on and made, but that the opinions are still being edited and written up."
politics,"In the next couple weeks. Maybe even today (but I am expecting it to be in early July - the case was argued somewhat recently and if a justice changes their mind, the opinion has to be re-written)."
politics,The court is still in session and is scheduled to release opinions and orders through the end of the month.
politics,"Quick explanation on not knowing how many opinions will be announced:

The court releases their opinions in reverse-seniority order with regards to which justice wrote the opinion. We know how many cases they have left to decide (19) and we know that they try to get all opinions released by the end of June - *however*, with the coronavirus shutting down the court for an unexpected length of time, it is possible (and highly likely) that opinions will be released in July. 

So once the day's announcements of opinions begins, we won't know that they've released the final one until they are done announcing them."
politics,Not today. Going to have to wait until next Monday for more.
politics,"Wow. Just the one ruling today. 

Second half of June (and maybe the first part of July) is gonna be intense."

This has me thinking there may be big rulings announced today, but that is purely speculation."
politics,"Trump may be getting ready to invoke the Insurrection Act. 

> The Insurrection Act is brief. It allows the President, at the request of a state government, to federalize the National Guard and to use the remainder of the Armed Forces to suppress an insurrection against that state's government. It further allows for the President to do the same in a state without the explicit consent of a state's government if it becomes impracticable to enforce federal laws through ordinary proceedings or if states are unable to safeguard its inhabitants' civil rights.

> The Insurrection Act has been invoked infrequently throughout American history, most recently following looting in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and during the 1992 Los Angeles riots."
politics,"Trump will attack Biden's delivery and completely overlook his message.

politics,"> Under the draft order, the Commerce Department would ask the Federal Communications Commission for new regulations clarifying when a company's conduct might violate the good faith provisions of Section 230 -- potentially making it easier for tech companies to be sued.

>That is consistent with a draft order whose text CNN first reported last summer -- and which prompted FCC officials to push back on the plan privately.

> The draft order instructs the Justice Department to consult with state attorneys general on allegations of anti-conservative bias. It bans federal agencies from advertising on platforms that have allegedly violated Section 230's good-faith principles.

> Finally, the draft order would direct the Federal Trade Commission to report on complaints about political bias collected by the White House and to consider bringing lawsuits against companies accused of violating the administration's interpretation of Section 230.

>The provisions regarding the FTC could raise additional legal questions, as the FTC is an independent agency that does not take orders from the President.

The same Ralph Nader who pulled nearly 500,000 votes away from John Kerry in the 2000 election?"
politics,"That's some dark shit. Like, if a character in a dystopian novel said that, I would think it was a little heavy handed."
pornvids,"Save this one while you can, because it’s been removed from almost every other site that’s hosted it."
politics,"Prepping for a primary challenge against Trump as a libertarian?

Smoothing the path for a run in 2024 (imagine being able to be the *only* GOP candidate who could say ""I'm the only person on this stage who called out Trump's and Barr's misdeeds"" and the potential value that has)?

Getting lots of 'likes' on Twitter and winning a bet with someone in his office?"
politics,You keep using that comparison...I do not think it means what you think it means.
politics,"But capitalism tells me that if individuals or businesses fail, it's because it's the will of the people/the market. 

And the GOP tells me that welfare is bad. 

I am confusion."
politics,"They're ignoring it so that when Trump loses in 2020, they can question the validity of the results and point to the incidents in Florida, comments from Democratic members of Congress, and comments from election security experts and use them to justify nullifying the results of the vote. 

Mark my words, when Trump and Co. get desperate, they'll try anything."
politics,"Michigan. 

We were absolutely slammed by the recession, and administrations in our county are skittish to adjust to a healthier economy because ""what if times get lean again?"""
politics,"I'm currently putting in 9% of my salary to my retirement, and my district matches up to 2%. I'm projected to be making ~$60k/year in retirement. 

Health coverage is rough. The standard plan for family coverage costs OVER $6800/year out of pocket *after* employer contributions/costs. Our district pays on a fixed-rate scale instead of a more traditional 80-20 scale, and they haven't adjusted for inflation in 6 years. 

Our payscale tops out at $70k for a bachelors degree (which I'd say 75% of the staff has), $80k for a masters, and $86k for a PhD (no staff have this)."

**For Comparison**

-Average Salaries in 2019 for...

Workers without high school degree: $30,524

Workers with a high school degree: $38,428

Workers with a bachelors degree: $70,200

Workers with an advanced/postgraduate degree: $81,848

(Yes, this is an overall average, not an average *starting* salary, but speaking anecdotally, the payscale in my district tops out after 15 years at ~$64,000. It would take a new-hire almost half of their career to be making *slightly* more than an average worker.)

politics,"Teacher here: Last time this was posted, someone commented something along the lines of ""Sure, but will it be cut down to $40,000 since they only work 2/3 of the year?""

Yes, *some* of us get summer off. I usually work with the summer school program to help prepare incoming freshmen for the rigor and pace of high school, and that takes up 9 of my 12 weeks off. 

And I'd love to see a non-teacher work my schedule during the school year. I'm at school by 6:30, here until at least 4:00 (unless I have extra-curricular clubs to run, in which case I'm here until 5:00 or 6:00) and then I have to go home, eat dinner, and grade schoolwork/prepare lessons for at least 2-3 hours every night. 

And there isn't a weekend where I don't spend at least *some* time in my classroom planning lessons, completing paperwork, or grading essays (I'm an English teacher, so there's a lot of time that goes into grading longform writing, but every content area has its own challenges). 

So yeah, I do get *part* of my summer off. I think it's well-earned."
