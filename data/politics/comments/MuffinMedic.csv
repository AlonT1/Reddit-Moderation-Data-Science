m365,"Hello everyone! I was riding my scooter today and suddenly it started making this very loud noise almost like a lawnmower and had very little power. This happens anytime I start power the scooter with the motor - when I spin the wheel freely myself, there is no noise.

I also noticed the whole scooter tends to vibrate and the tail light seems to have stopped working. The control panel and front light have no issues.

Any idea how to fix this? Thanks!"

emergencymedicine,"Fluid and electrolyte shifts:

From the fluid standpoint: If you start rapidly redistributing all that glucose, water is going to follow. DKA patients are already often dehydrated due to a similar effect: excess glucose → lost into urine → water follows. If you throw in insulin on top, you're going to push all that glucose into cells → water follows → ↑ intracellular fluids + ↓ intravascular fluids. This can be life threatening in some cases, such as cerebral edema.

Electrolytes, in particular potassium, raise a similar issue: DKA patients are already relatively hypokalemic due to excess renal losses as described above. Insulin will cause an intracellular potassium shift, further depleting intravascular potassium and worsening the hypokalemia."
Residency,"We had a wonderful PA when I worked as an outpatient scribe - he had been practicing for 40 years. First in primary care, then emergency medicine, and now rheumatology. Excellent provider and knew when he was over his head. I have a lot of respect for PAs.

The issue is that it's unpredictable. Yes - there are a lot of excellent ones who I would love to work with one day as a physician. There are also midlevels like described in the post. Unfortunately, you never know which one you're going to get and I think that's a lot of the problem. While there are a ton of good ones, the problematic ones lead people to needing to play to the ""lowest common denominator"" - both for patient safety and inter professional reasons. If we assume everyone is incompetent, then we take more precautionary overhead and burden, but look out for patient outcomes. If we go with ""well this person may be competent"" but then they're not, well then (1) your ass is on the line and (2) patients get harmed.

How do we address this? If we can't be sure what ""kind"" of midlevel we're getting, how do we ensure patient safety without assuming everyone is at the lowest bar? You can get references from more experienced ones but that only goes so far.

That's not to say there are no bad physicians, but even those I wouldn't want to work with completed medical school, a training path, and board exams that are tried and true. (As I understand it, PAs are also somewhat standardized. NPs, to my knowledge, are really have no central oversight). From a liability standpoint, it also is advantageous - you referred to someone with a (usually) higher level of training and a lot of it becomes their responsibility in that field (you can of course still be roped into it, but it's different)."

Residency,"I guess I can post it now since it worked! This was the opening paragraph to one of the essays I wrote for the school I'm currently at:

> Ever since I can remember, I have been inquisitive, enthusiastic, and passionate about learning.
As a young boy, I would often experiment at home, creating various “chemical” mixtures in the
kitchen and running wiring throughout the house using toilet paper. When times were tough, I
would don my firefighter costume and put out the imaginary fires that had begun in the paper
wires. I interacted with the world through the innocence of childhood, carefree and without the
biases of complexity. My early years are best summarized by Calvin, the young six-year-old boy
from Bill Watterson’s timeless comic Calvin and Hobbes: “It’s a wonderful world, Hobbes ol’
buddy… Let’s go exploring!”

And this is the last paragraph in which I referenced my childhood again:

> In many ways, I am both strikingly the same and remarkably different from the person I was as a
young boy. As I have grown and gained experience through education, leadership, and service, I
have never stopped learning more about people and exploring the world around me. I am more
responsible, more independent, and more confident than I was as a child. At the same time, I
have continued to look at the world through both the lenses of simplicity and those of a more
knowledgeable young adult. I am confident my ability to simultaneously lead and serve, work
with people of all cultures, and see the world from multiple perspectives will guide me as I
become a compassionate and empathetic physician."

aliyah,"There's no requirement you actually practice any of the religion / faith to qualify - how each person chooses to conduct their Judaism is irrelevant. Technically, according to Jewish law, it follows matrilineal decent and the Judaism was passed down to you from your great-great grandmother. By that definition, you are considered Jewish.

The tricky part here is going to be actually finding a way to prove this. If you're claiming Judaism from your mother (which, per Jewish law, you are), then you need a letter from a rabbi essentially stating that your mother is Jewish. What proof the rabbi wants will be up to them essentially but the cemetery proof should hopefully be a good start.

Note: This is based on my research on Nefesh B' Nefesh, which handles US, Canada, and the UK. If you're coming from elsewhere, then you'll need to lookup the specific requirements with whatever organization is in your country."

If you're coming from the US, Canada, or the UK, then reach out to Nefesh B' Nefesh and they'll hook you up with an Aliyah advisor to guide you through the process. If you're coming from another country, find out which organization assists with this and reach out to them."

I have friends in medical school who describe similar things to what you mentioned regarding your nursing school experience. For most of us though, it's nothing like that. I can't speak for nursing programs in general as it's not my field but from what my sister and RN friends have told me, it's mostly not like you describe.

politics,"> would be to either have manual input based on the released polls to manually decide who should be in the top, maybe, 6? Or perhaps just create an entirely manually created header

Doing this manually took an unsustainable amount of time which is why we moved to the bot - it generates the entire table in less than a minute + posts it to reddit. There are certainly ways to considering changing the automation, but going back to a manual process isn't feasible.

> are way off to the side in the header,

There will always be candidates off to the side requiring scrolling - we can't avoid that and picking which candidates become more visible would not be fair. Polls change, ranking changes, etc... Changing the sort order for each of these threads would ultimately be more confusing for users to find the data they want.

We have users who support all the candidates, and it's important that each candidate have an equal opportunity of being displayed so their results can be shown. The most fair and consistent way to do this is alphabetically.

It's worth noting the bot formats the table exactly the same as we did manually - nothing changed in that regard."

Bot writer here - this is our first time using a new bot we wrote to automatically pull and format the polling information from a third party source, so it's still in untested waters!

There's a lot of polls in here, and how the candidates rank varies poll-to-poll. As such, there's no easy way to sort by ""rank"" since it's inconsistnet. Tables on reddit are sortable though so if you click each header it'll sort!

I got the ER job with the expectation of doing a lot of blood draws, simple procedures (i.e. splinting fractures), vitals, etc... Ended up being a psych sitter half the time and, for a variety of reasons quit and started scribing instead.

My 2 cents: The ED is great but you'll gain way more clinical experience as an EMT in the field where you're expected to provide basic treatments, make some simple decisions, etc... That being said, if your goal is just to beef up your medical school application, then I don't think it matters too much which you pick - just make sure it's something you'll like (re: first paragraph). I do think having EMT experience would give you a small leg up when you start clinicals in med school if that matters to you - knowing how to ""look"" at a patient, take a history, examine them, and start building up the ability to differentiate ""sick vs. not sick"" in a few seconds is crucial.

Regarding med school - that's actually pretty fantastic! Acceptances are of course ideal, but several wait lists at this point in the cycle gives you a reasonable chance at getting in somewhere. Definitely keep working on your application in case you need to apply again and keep your head up for this cycle! I know people who got off wait lists from now until July."
step1,It helps me a ton! I have a pair of Bose QC 35IIs and they’re wonderful for focusing. The new 700 version just came out so a lot of places have the QC35 on sale. I’ve seen them as low as $250 ($100 off).
medicalschool,More like 98% if we account for the pulmonary arteries.
Medical_Students,"Von Gierke disease is a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. Remember the basic pathway of glycogenolysis: Gylcogen->G1P -> G6P -> Glucose. It’s this last step which is defective, so G6P builds up (the first step is carried out by glycogen phosphorylase).

>	I thought glycogen synthase was activated by Insulin which your pancreas shouldn’t be producing given how hypoglycemic you are...and if anything the hypoglycemia should be leading to more glucagon release breaking down even more glycogen.

Correct: insulin activates glycogen synthesis and glucagon activates breakdown. However, the high levels of G6P inhibit glycogen phosphorylase, overcoming glucagon activation thereby halting the first step of glycogenolysis. This has no effect on synthesis and insulin activation leading to glycogenesis is functional. 

>	Why doesn’t the G6P built up all enter glycolytic pathways such as glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway?

With G6P unable to be dephosphorylated, causing a deficiency of phosphate needed to continue through glycolysis, and thus enter other pathways. Of note the G6P buildup will be diverted to the HMP shunt as you suggested."

NoStupidQuestions,">	blood pressure is the product of two factors, heart rate and stroke volume(the volume ejected from the heart per beat).
>	BP = HR x SV

Not quite.

Blood Pressure is the product of the cardiac output (amount pumped out each minute) and total peripheral resistance (how constricted your blood vessels are): `BP = CO * TPR` - In other words, it’s related to how much blood you pump out each minute and how “tight” your vessels are.

On the other hand, the formula you mentioned, `HR * SV` is the `CO`, i.e. how much blood pumped out per beat and how many beats per minute.

If we expand these two formulas, we actually get part of your original formula, to end up with `BP = HR * SV * TPR`"

The adding bulk is also a plus to me - the iPad fits in very secure and feels well protected.
ipad,"I really like it so far! The backlit keyboard + added protection were both important to me. I’ve had no trouble adapting to typing on here and am typing pretty fast already. The biggest annoyance is that the top left key is a home button and not an Esc - I keep pressing it instinctively to close an alert window or similar. Although it doesn’t have a lot of angles, it can be laid flat which the Apple one can’t. I don’t mind the battery much and it connects instantly when I open it. It’s definitely heavier although I don’t think unreasonably so and my bag doesn’t feel heavy with it in it."

They're mid-level providers and as such, work under the license of a physician. Whoever's license they're practice under will absolutely want to know about these issues.

> The patients seem to have no idea, they all LOVE this PA and refer to them lovingly as Dr. xfirstname, which frankly grinds my gears.

Patients like when providers hand out medications easily, even if they aren't indicated. The providers being liked isn't a good thing if it's for the wrong reasons.

> I am talking with my boss tomorrow about this, and am hoping he will be cool with me speaking to my medical director. 

I'd just go to the medical director. This is not a scribing issue and not really anything that applies to your boss.

There are consequences for their dangerous actions. Wherever you work will find new providers who are willing to provide appropriate care."

medicalscribe,"> How long does it actually takes to get started? Like if I get an offer for a location, would I start training right away? Or would it be after a bunch of additional paperwork and waiting for drug screenings and stuff and not start training for a couple of weeks without pay, or does that stuff happen during training?

It really depends on your chief scribe. I think the I-9 has to be completed within 72 hours but other than that, a lot of it is based on how fast they move. The training is paid but they moved to some new online virtual training supposedly, although some chiefs still do in person training. I don't know how long virtual training is.

From what I've heard, the online one are ""live interactive"" classes of some sort, i.e. not on your own schedule completely. Floor training is more variable and based on your trainer's assessment of how ready you are. You have a pulse, so you're already 75% of the way towards passing training. Just be sure to stay focused and ask a lot of questions, and don't get put down if some of the doctors have less than stellar attitudes.

The polos are provided - you get two when you start. If you want to get a sweatshirt or something to wear over it, some generic black or navy fleece should suffice. Again, depends on how stringent your chief scribe is. I have a fleece that the network I work for got for all the nursing and clerical staff, as do a few of the other SA scribes in my network.

We also had pharmacological constraints available to use, usually in consultation with medical direction.

medicine,"> On what planet are they prepared to be ""generalists?""

They're not, but the entire idea behind NP (at least within the NP sphere) is that they are. They push for similar practice rights with a fraction of the training. This is the point I was trying to convey - there is a huge discrepancy between the training vs. the rights the degree confers."

medicine,">	It does not prepare you for ""general"" medical practice, that's what most people here are saying.

It does not prepare you adequately, but the intent (in theory) is that it will. I was commenting on this discrepancy, or trying to poorly.

I'm saying that they shouldn't be equally weighted as they have different goals. 500 hours is 500 hours. However, 500 hours in a focused and dedicated ""speciality"" is much different than 500 hours spread across a variety of fields. Also there's really no such thing as independent practice in EMS - there are a set of guidelines which serve as standing orders, but barring some special scenarios, you can't deviate out of them.

I think both Paramedics and NPs would benefit from more clinical hours - it can only help. I don't think the same hours standard should be applied to both types of practitioners. I spent most of my clinical hours in the ambulance where I almost exclusively worked. That's in contrast to NPs who do a few hours in a variety of areas and then pick one to work in. I think 500 hours dedicated to EMS prepared me better as a paramedic than a few hours spread broadly would as an NP who has to pick a specialty with a much larger scope of practice.

Does that make paramedics better than NPs? No, of course not. They both have their pros and cons, and I felt there were inadequacies in my clinical training as well."
medicine,"(Former) paramedic here. The training is completely different and has a considerably different goal. PAs and NPs are trained to be generalists and able to work in any sort of medical setting. You can't possibly cover the entire spectrum of medicine in 500 hours.

I'm not saying 500 hours was sufficient for paramedic school - I think more would have been very helpful, but it's inherently smaller in scope and more focused.  Paramedic training focuses on short-lasting emergency treatment for acute illnesses. These can certainly be very severe and require complex management, but without more diagnostic tools that EDs have, we're pretty limited anyways and the more complex issues wouldn't be fixable pre-hospital either way. No one is going to be pushing potassium, doing even minor surgery, or inserting chest tubes in an ambulance (with some exceptions).

That being said, I'm all for expanded scope of practice for EMS - if the training can be improved to go along with it. I don't think it's a fair comparison though to say that 500 hours of very focused and specific training is equivalent to 500 hours of training that should prepare you for any medical setting."

premed,"Previous studies have shown a mild to moderate correlation between the two exams but not a strong one. I'm not sure about the new MCAT, as all the studies I've seen are for the old one.

Even with a mild to moderate correlation, is there a correlation between Step 1 and the ""real world""? It's relatively easy to study score correlations since you have quantitative data. But does a higher step score correlate with being a better physician?

This isn't a criticism of the MCAT or USMLE itself - you obviously need some sort of licensing exam. But standardized tests are themselves limited in their ability to predict real world outcome."
premed,"> they've created a system that lends itself so easily to the elitism and preference of very high stat applicants.

This is an issue with all standardized testing, not simply the MCAT / AAMC. Students from more affluent backgrounds have more access to preparatory materials (i.e. Kaplan) and more time to study (as opposed to working to afford their basic needs). While many people tout the MCAT as ""the great equalizer,"" the reality is that it's an inherently unequal exam in that it favors certain demographics over others. The SAT/ACT are similar - wealthier high schoolers have more access to prep.

I like your idea of F/P/HP and I think the AAMC's data actually supports it as a reasonable methodology of reporting scores. While this is anecdotal, anyone reading over this subreddit and other pre-med resources will note pretty quickly that the top scores focused much more on practice exams than content / knowledge. While some people are innately better test takers than others, I think this highlights an important point: to some degree, the MCAT examines test taking ability more than it does ""real world"" applicable knowledge.

The AAMC's M2 progression table seems to support this. If you look at only the data that the AAMC considers an indicator of being prepared to handle medical school (>= 500), then the data isn't all too variable. Unhindered progression to M2 between the 502 group and the 518+ group is only a 4% increase. While it's hard to know what accounts for this difference, I think it's fair to say it's a small increase.

If the data AAMC presents suggests that above a certain score, success in the pre-clinical years is not significantly different, then what value is there in differentiating between a 510 applicant and a 525 applicant (without a more significant correlation between MCAT and Step)? Reporting scores more reflective of this would not only report only the relevant data  (< 500 = F, 501-509 = P, 510+ = HP), but would give SES disadvantages applicants a more even playing field."

ems,"I don't think the sentiment is the problem itself as much as how it's taught as a mantra instead of in the proper context of ""ectopic pregnancy should be high on your list of differentials for ABD pain in any woman of childbearing age.""

That's a reasonable and important statement to make, but it needs to be taken into context with how it should be further assessed. Assessments are often taken at face value, i.e. people asking ""is there any chance you're pregnant?"" and taking ""no"" as it is. Well what does ""no"" mean to each person? For the 27 YOF who is married, it may mean being on oral BCP and only having sex with her husband who is s/p vasectomy 2 years. For a 21 YOF college student, it may mean ""I've had unprotected sex with multiple partners but they didn't cum in me.""

These general statements need to be better taught along how to properly assess them. History can tell you a lot, and a physical exam can guide you (although not rule it out). The tunnel vision comes from a failure of learning a proper assessment, not teaching ""one liners"" as treatment standards."

If you want to hold off on submitting it, you can do that as well, it just seems like one more thing to have to worry about down the road instead of just having it done from the get go. I understand some people prefer not to send it to schools unless absolutely needed, and that's perfectly reasonable. I don't think that's the recommended route for most people to take though. As far as I'm aware, school's don't deny people based on their FAFSA SAR, although I could be wrong about that."

If you submit it now and get accepted later on, the school will have the information and can process your FAFSA immediately to extend offers. Otherwise, your aid may be further delayed, which in turn may delay deciding on a school."
