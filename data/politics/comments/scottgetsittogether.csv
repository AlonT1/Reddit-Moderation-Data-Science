poppunkers,"He’s a weird dude - but he’s not creepy. I’ve stayed at his house multiple times when I was in a touring band. Yes, when he listened to your demo - someone would walk on his back. There was literally nothing sexual about it, and nothing weird happened in my experiences. Always was a super nice guy."
iPhone12,"It’s a seam, not a lip. It is normal."
AirpodsPro,"In accessibility there’s a setting for “call audio routing.” Check to make sure that is set right. Other than that, I don’t have any idea."
iPhone12,"I don’t have the Lifeproof case, but even a small barrier between the magnets significantly reduces the pull."
StonerEngineering,http://sfevergreen.com/could-this-be-the-worlds-oldest-bong/
AirpodsPro,Check your settings and make sure it’s set to receive the call audio on your AirPods and not your iPhone.
StonerEngineering,This is fake...
AirpodsPro,"They are fake - the stickers on the back are not correct.

Also, the image of the pods on the front does not look correctly raised, and the shadows on the image of the pods are off."
AirpodsPro,Because it needs the case to update. Don’t buy knockoff things if you expect them to work right.
iPhone12,"1. The MagSafe adapter may or may not hold on using a non-MagSafe case. If it does, it will be weaker than if you didn’t have the case on. Using a MagSafe case will make the hold stronger than if you just have the phone.

2. There are charging pads you can buy that have the pad for an iPhone/AirPods with an AppleWatch charger built in on the side, but you can’t charge the AppleWatch with a regular QI charger. 

3. The wallet is great - but it’s just a wallet, it does not protect your phone from a three year old ;p"
AirpodsPro,You’ll need an actual Apple case to update the pods.
AirpodsPro,"As far as I know, to turn them both off you need an iOS device. I can say though that I have literally never used them with transparency and noise cancellation off - having both off makes everything sound a little weird. The sound is much better in either transparency or noise cancelation modes."
AirpodsPro,"On Android, you only have the option to use ANC and transparency. You have to be connected to an iPhone/iPad/Mac to have both turned off."
AirpodsPro,They’re probably not making the connection in the charging case. Take them to Apple and they’ll probably just replace the case for you while you’re still in warranty.
iPhone12,"The resolutions are the same, it’s no different than the regular 12."
airpods,"1. The serial number is bad - that means it’s a stolen serial, if you search it on Google - you’ll find it on other boxes too.

2. The box is all wrong. The easiest way to explain that would be the little dot on case on the back of the box. [It should be green](https://imgur.com/gallery/HFhXfLf), not gray. There are other dead giveaways on the box too, but that’s the easiest one to spot if you aren’t familiar with the box."
airpods,Whatever apps add support.
airpods,They are definitely fake - do not buy.
AirpodsPro,"If you’re asking if the batteries are better - they’re pretty much the same. These are tiny batteries, and unfortunately - they just don’t last credibly long. Best advice would be to get a pair of the pros if you’re thinking about it, and snagging Apple Care with it so you can get them replaced once the batteries wear down."
iPhone12,"The silicon cases have an extra magnet in it, which definitely does add to the strength of the hold on the wallet. You will not get nearly the same hold through a case that has no MagSafe magnet, as there is a barrier between the magnet in the phone and the wallet. It does not hold on well at all with a barrier between them."
AirpodsPro,No. Not real.
AirpodsPro,"Or - think of it this way - a long backstory to make you trust them more. It’s not legit, don’t buy. The font is a little off too. The green dot is one of the tell tale signs of scammers, all legit ones have the green on the back."
AirpodsPro,"What’s the seller’s story, and how much are they selling for? They are pretty much 100% likely fake. The little dot in the [middle of the charging case on the back should be green](https://imgur.com/gallery/HFhXfLf), not gray."
iPhone12,Alarm does drain battery in my experience.
iPhone12,Do you use an alarm or anything?
AirpodsPro,Same 🤷‍♂️
iPhone12,Do you turn everything off when you go to bed and not use an alarm? I’ve never had an iPhone that didn’t lose a few percent of battery over night.
iPhone12,5% battery drain at night sounds very normal to me?
iPhoneX,Battery replacements are cheap - just replace the battery.
iPhone12,"I dunno what to tell you, they very clearly edited the pictures. Photographers edit their pictures, that doesn’t change the quality of the camera. They even say they’re edited with the Photos app."
iPhone12,You might want to compare to non edited photos. All of those pictures have been clearly touched up and edited - they aren’t straight from the camera.
airpods,"Definitely fake. Buy them from Apple.

1. Serial number comes back showing “ We’re sorry, but this is a serial number for a product that has been replaced.” This means it’s a reused serial number, and it’s not legit.

2. The AirPod Pros have two stickers with all that info - not one."
airpods,"You probably just talked to people who don’t know what they’re talking about with Apple stuff. They’re not Apple employees or anything. They’re probably confusing if you replace a broken with a warranty one purchasing one outright. If they sell it, they should be able to sell it to you even if you don’t have a broken one to bring back (like, if you lose it, for example). 

Unless you can’t buy a replacement at Best Buy and can only swap them out - which would be odd, yeah. But really sounds like they just didn’t know what they were talking about exactly."
disney,You got it - but it’s a show.
airpods,Buy a new case from Apple instead?
AirpodsPro,"If you have to ask - they’re probably fake, but it’s pretty impossible to tell with a low res picture."
iPhone12,"Well advertising is just that - advertising. There’s a few review videos by reviewers who have been able to get them, so watch those if you’re wondering about the features."
iPhone12,Well nobody has them yet so that’s kinda hard to say.
airpods,"Well, you’re going to end up paying over $100 for fake AirPods if you take these.  I’d work to save up the rest of the money, or just get a decent pair of headphones that aren’t AirPods for that price range."
airpods,Just get AppleCare and then you don’t really have to worry about it.
airpods,I wouldn’t trust it. Just spend the extra $15 and get legit ones. It’s just not smart to buy AirPods from randos.
iPhone12,"Probably just can’t find the culprit - other contains a lot of weird things. It also includes things like email, messages, any attachments in email and messages, all cache on the phone, Siri, voice memos... There are a lot of different things it could be."
iPhone12,"If I show you a video of what I mean will that help? I understand it’s not the same as music, movies, etc - but it’s also stored there. Give me a second and I’ll show you what I mean!

Edit:
[Watch this video](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qh5NUDU), see how when I delete the some podcasts, the “other” storage numbers fall too. I can do the same with videos or music, too. I can’t tell you why, only that it has worked for me, and I’ve gotten rid of pretty much all of it."
iPhoneX,"They are not - you definitely have an aftermarket screen. If you have any ability to return it, I would."
iPhoneX,Do you have True Tone? It sounds like they replaced the screen with a bunk screen. Unless you get it from Apple refurbished or an authorized retailer - chances are low that its going to have the original Apple parts.
iPhone12,"That’s not a hardware bug, that’s a software thing. Search around for ways to clear the “other” stuff.

For example, when I transferred my stuff over from my X to my 12, for some reason it downloaded all the podcasts from a few that I follow. When I looked at my “Other” storage - it was at like 30gb. I went through and realized that the podcasts were included there, deleted all those, and it’s back down to normal.

“Other” also includes things like music, movies, TV shows, other media, your messages, etc."
iPhoneX,"Yeah that sounds like a pretty big red flag, especially if it’s supposed to be “refurbished.” You shouldn’t see any image retention. Did you buy it off of a legit site? Sounds like they either “refurbished” it with a by putting in a bunk screen, or they just sold you a bad phone. Does the screen have True Tone and all that?"
iPhone12,"It’s not the metals that hold the wallet on though, it’s the magnets - the MagSafe case adds to the magnetic pull. Adding a second magnet increases the strength of the magnets."
iPhone12,"Mine just arrived today - it holds on very well without the MagSafe case. I haven’t read what OP read about it having a better girl without the case, but in my experience today, it definitely has a bit of a stronger hold with the case on."
airpods,"The inside doesn’t match mine, and mine are legit - so it seems that would be why. It could be a country thing though as people are saying."
AirpodsPro,"If you have spatial audio/ANC/transparency, that’s a pretty good sign that they’re legit. You also have the correct firmware version. The pros only have about a 4.5 hour battery life, and the charging case can charge them up a few times. Of course, letting any battery product like that sit for a few days - it’s going to lose some power as well, especially if the pods are sitting in the case checking the charge. 

If you call Apple and have the receipt from Amazon, you should be able to get the warranty date fixed there. What you’re seeing is an estimated date. The warranty starts the day you buy the product, so it shouldn’t be December 17th, which is probably why that updated"
PAXvapor,Yeah I figured - it’s hilarious they do these in depth fakes and then mess up a freaking word in the box.
PAXvapor,"It came with a “maintanGe kit?”

I don’t think it did. It would have come with a “maintenanCe kit.”"
PAXvapor,"100% fake, do not buy.

Pax’s do not come with “MAINTENANGE KITS”."
AirpodsPro,It doesn’t seem like you’re having any actual issues...
iPhone12,"If you’re using a fast charging cable and brick, it’s fast charging. If not, then it’s not. They got rid of the chime indicator."
iPhoneX,"Depends what you’re planning on doing and what options you have. If you’re planning to keep the phone for a while, and can switch carriers or whatever, there’s some good carrier deals. Like, AT&T will give you $700 in credits towards a new phone with an iPhone X trade in."
iPhone12,"It’s to prevent overheating, all the OLED iPhones do this. It happens when the battery heats up, so if you’re charging your phone and using the screen - it’ll happen once the battery heats the phone up."
iPhone12,"No, it’s not defective. If you don’t like auto brightness, turn it off.

The iPhone 12 pro has a 800 max nitts. The iPhone 12 has 625. Auto brightness doesn’t even get you to the 625 nitts unless you’re in bright sunlight or a bright room. Turning off auto brightness on the pro will give you significantly more brightness than turning off auto brightness on the normal 12. 

With auto brightness on, your screen will be the same brightness as the 12’s screen will be with auto brightness on - significantly less than the max brightness on the 12 Pro."
iPhone12,"No - that’s how auto brightness is on the iPhone. With auto brightness on, it won’t turn up to the full brightness unless you’re in a bright/sunny condition."
StandUpComedy,"The Sam Morril and Joe List specials were actually released via Comedy Central, just on YouTube simultaneously with their app. Both good specials, but they were picked up before release."
iPhone12,"It sounds like you used your old SIM card. You gotta use the new SIM card to activate the 5G. When I popped my old SIM into my 12, it only gave me the LTE option as well."
iPhone12,"I dunno, I live in a pretty rural area and I get 5G on AT&T in my area. I have over 200mbps at the moment - and I haven't had any speed issues since upgrading with my phone. Did you use the new SIM card, or did you use your old one? Sounds like you used the old SIM card.

Also, no need for casual racism because you're upset. This seems like an issue that you could have easily fixed had you read the info that came with your phone."
iPhoneX,"That’s not 5 years, that’s 6 years total though. It will receive updates through two thirds of 2024. The 6 came out in September 2014 and received updates through September 2020. That’s still 6 years.

You can look at it as 5 iOS releases, but there’s a ton of incremental updates between those - so it would be weird to look at it as 5 years when it’s not."
iPhoneX,"The 6S has support in iOS14 - it came out in 2015. Thats 6 years, September 2015 to September 2021. I guess I should have said September instead of October, my bad."
iPhoneX,"There is no significant change in the processor speed that you’ll be able to notice - the XR isn’t really faster then the X. Honestly, my 12 doesn’t even feel **that** much faster than my X. Plus with the OLED screen, the animations look so much better - it feels faster. My girlfriend has the 11, and I would honestly recommend the X over the 11 even.

As far as “support,” you’re way outside of the Apple Warranty - the only extra “support” you’ll get is that it’s probable based on past trends that you’ll get one more software upgrade with the XR. However - Apple has been pushing that they’re making better phones capable of lasting longer, so it’s possible they’ll extend the support for the X more than for like the 6S series. One extra year of iOS upgrades should not be significant enough to make your decision. Either way, the X should have software updates until at least October 2024. 

Get the X. The screen is a light years better, it’s slightly cheaper, you’ll have software for 4 years at least, nearly the same battery life, a much better camera, stainless steel instead of aluminum, and to top it all off - the X is noticeably lighter than the XR as well."
survivor,"As someone who used to work in kitchens, including the big chains - I can’t tell you what you want to hear. I can’t tell you anything that you want to hear."
AirpodsPro,"No - AppleCare covers a lot more. You pay a small deductible, but they'll replace the AirPod. This also includes the batteries - so if you pay the $30 for AppleCare+ and your battery starts degrading within 2 years (it will), you'll get them replaced for free. If you break an AirPod for any reason, you can pay the $30 deductible and get it replaced."
iPhone12,"It’ll depend on how old the SIM is probably there, but T-Mobile does also has this:

> While your current SIM card is 5G compatible, it is not capable of using the 5G standalone technology we recently rolled out."
AirpodsPro,These are fake - the sticker is not correct at all.
AirpodsPro,"What does it say the date of purchase was? It should also give you the date of purchase.

Do you have transparency and noise cancelation modes? Can you properly set up the headphones through the iPhone in ""Headphone Accommodations?"" What does the info in your Bluetooth info about the AirPods say?

These will all show you if they are fake as well. If they don't pass one of those tests - they are 100% fake. However, if those are the ear tips that came in the box and the box was sealed - you can just stop there, it's fake.  Those are not the correct tips for the AirPod Pros. They put one in to make it look ""legit,"" and then replace the rest with tips that don't fit at all. Also, the AirPod in your picture does not look like a legit AirPod."
AirpodsPro,Get a refund. Buy from a legit source.
iPhone12,"The new phone will come with a new SIM card, you have to activate and use the new SIM card. Not sure why the posts here say to swap with the old SIM. The old SIM card will probably work, but it won’t be able to access 5G.

If you use the old SIM card, 5G will not work. With a 5G phone, you need a 5G SIM.

Standup,"It’s always good to remember that especially an open-mic audience doesn’t care about you personally if you do bomb. You can get off stage, go have a drink, whatever - and the audience will mostly forget that you even had a bad set (unless you do something really badly to piss people off). If you do well, someone might buy you the drink. If you do poorly, someone might still buy you the drink because you did poorly.

You’re thinking a whole lot more about what happened while you were in state then the audience is thinking about what happened while you were on stage."
iPhone12,"They will definitely make MagSafe charging banks, which will make it easy to charge on the go without a battery case (I think there are some third party MagSafe banks, but I don’t know their reliability). I would suggest getting a MagSafe case, then you don’t have to worry about those accessories being friendly with the case on, or needing a battery specific case."
iPhoneX,"I did for like 5 minutes, and now Haptic Touch feels almost the same - it’s just a little bit slower. I stopped noticing that weeks ago though."
iphone,"Yeah, but pretty much every smartphone has one of those and pretty much every smartphone warranty is voided by that. They all use the same sensors, and they pretty much all void the warranty. The indicator also has nothing to do with the water resistance rating on the phone.

If you drop your phone in the water, then there is a chance that the warranty is voided. However, chances are the phone will still be working - unlike 5-10 years ago where your phone would be nearly guaranteed to be both broken and have a voided warranty."
iphone,"Well to be fair there, pretty much every manufacturer of smartphones uses the same type of indicator - and pretty much every manufacturer of smartphones will tell you the same thing (I’m sure you could find some small number of smartphones that might not void a warranty for the indicator trip).

Apple doesn’t claim that putting your phone into water *wont* void the warranty, and they say clearly that water damage *will* void the warranty. They just say that the iPhone is rated to an industry standard of IP68 for water resistance. That doesn’t mean that if you drop your phone in the bathtub it won’t void the warranty, just that if you drop it into the bathtub - it shouldn’t break. This is nearly exactly the same for every electronics manufacturer that rates their devices to the same type standard, and I would argue - Apple usually gives the better warranty when you compare.  Plus, AppleCare will cover water damage.

From Samsung’s standard warranty:

> This Standard Limited Warranty does not cover: (a) defects or damage resulting from accident, misuse, abnormal use, abnormal conditions, improper storage, **exposure to liquid**, moisture, dampness, sand or dirt, neglect, or unusual physical, electrical or electromechanical stress;"
iphone,"They don't claim that they're waterproof in any condition at all - because they aren't. They're water resistant in the conditions that Apple states, with IP68 - an industrial standard for water resistance:

>iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are splash, water, and dust **resistant** and were tested under **controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes).** Splash, water, and dust resistance are **not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear.** Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.

Apple does not, and has never, stated that an iPhone is waterproof."
iphone,">Second, and more seriously, Apple made iPhone water resistance claims in its marketing, but then refused warranty service on phones which suffered water damage.

So, will they also sue Apple because glass breaks and they're marketing Ceramic Shield as being much stronger? Is everything that is marketable also supposed to be covered by a warranty in Italy? Seems nuts."
iPhone12,It’s normal. I can only hear it on mine if I put the device next to my ear - it’s the camera.
iPhone12,"128, especially if you plan to keep for 3-5 years. You may not need the extra space, but you’re essentially in the clear to never have to worry about having to delete things to make room on your phone. 

Maybe you don’t now, but at some point - you might want to download music/podcasts/etc., and the extra space will allow you to be able to do that as well."
iPhone12,Nothing is being added to be disabled. What you’re seeing is the image load on your phone - it just takes a split second to load when you pull it up like that. You’re seeing the picture in lower quality as it loads - that’s all.
iPhone12,"It’s a good camera - good cameras take sharp and detailed pictures, not blurry ones. You can’t change that unless you get yourself a worse camera, or export the picture into lower quality."
iPhone12,It’s not a filter - it’s just loading the picture.
airpods,Yes! The whole thing doesn’t fit in a Reddit username!
iphone,"And if they did, chances are many of them would still be having the same display issue at the moment anyways..."
iphone,"https://old.reddit.com/r/iPhone12/comments/jxbfij/purple_flicker_with_grays_in_dark_mode/

I have OLED smearing on my 12, I posted a video on my post here. It doesn’t happen on every brightness level, and only scrolling on black backgrounds with gray like the settings on iPhone. I don’t get it like you’re seeing with white text on pure black."
iPhone12,"You know, it’s a lot easier to fake a “how did this happen I swear it’s real” post than it is to fake a video of it happening. Of course you can’t post a video, it didn’t happen."
PAXvapor,"It probably wasn’t held upright at the dispensary, so more of the oil moves into one side. It’s not that one side is hitting and the other isn’t/Pax isn’t working right - it just isn’t evened out. When you get a cart, you can pretty easily pull off the mouthpiece and see the fill levels.


When this happens to me, honestly I usually just turn it up a bit higher since it’s only pulling oil from one side - and I never have an issue."
PAXvapor,"You gotta be real careful with a hair dryer though, they can very easily warp the plastic."
iPhone12,"I don’t have a 12 pro, but I got the AirPods Pro recently - and I love them. Definitely get those! Do it quick and you can still snag an awesome Black Friday deal."
airpods,"They asked what kind of employee sites - you’re giving the most basic vague answers - one could easily deduce that you might not actually even work for Apple. I could say I work for Apple and have login info but can’t tell you anything about it, too...

It might be outdated, but it sure says a lot more than “Can’t really say.”"

You can find a lot of this with just Google searching - it’s just the test apps, internal employee news, retail apps, etc."
iPhoneX,If you want to use the phone for 2+ more years - you’ll need to get the battery replaced. At 83% it won’t last 2 years. You’ll also have to worry more about the screen having issues being aftermarket - they’re not usually quality screens. I would honestly not suggest keeping it if you’re planning on using it for a number of years.
iPhoneX,The iPhone X is rated at 625 nits
iPhone12,"Yes, it is okay. He was trying to get you to buy an accessory for his commission. Lower wattage does mean a slower charge, though."
iPhone12,"It seems to be pretty normal - I have it on mine. I’m guessing it’s gonna be a software thing, but if not - it’s a known issue so they’ll swap it out later if it isn’t software. I’m not worried about it."
iPhone12,"The 12 Pro has an extra camera, 6gb of ram vs 4 on the 12 (for the extra camera load), stainless steal edges, and a little brighter screen (HDR video should be the same on both though).

The 12 is cheaper, has brushed aluminum edges, and it is very noticeably lighter than the Pro.

I upgraded from the X to the 12. Had there not been a promo to get the 12 for free with a trade in of my X - I would have kept the X for another year or two. The 12 will be perfectly future proof, with a much better processor and 4GB of ram vs. 3 in the X. Honestly, it doesn’t even feel that much faster than the X. The pros don’t feel any different speed wise. Coming from a 7, it will be a whole different world - and it will hold up longer much better than the 7 has longterm(I also own a 7).

I would say get a 128gb 12 (it’s just an extra $50 over the 64gb- and gets you the extra space for long term). Then spend the difference between the 12 and the Pro on AppleCare for the peace of mind."
iPhone12,"Yeah, it sounds like you accidentally also restored the XS from the backup as opposed to just backing it up."
iPhone12,"Ah, well to be quite honest - there’s probably not much Apple can do there. I hate to say it because I get it - I have a ton of rare music that I couldn’t get back if I lost it all. But, they can’t really get back music that’s been deleted from a device unless you’ve backed it up somewhere.

Backing up your phone to your computer doesn’t save any of the music with it - it says so right on Apple’s site. Apple can’t undelete files on your iPhone anymore then they can undelete something from your laptop. Sounds like what happened was you accidentally backed up/restored from back up your XS when you just wanted to back it up, which is why it’s also not there now."
iPhone12,"You gotta get Apple Music and use the match thing. Then it saves all your music on their cloud - so it doesn’t go anywhere unless you get rid of Apple Music. Copyright/where you obtained the music matters not for the matching - my entire music collection is matched on Apple’s cloud with all of my music I’ve ever had.

Alternatively, and honestly - in addition to, you should get an external hard drive to keep all of your music and other important documents on in case something crashes or happens."
PAXvapor,"Have you downloaded it to your iPhone in the past? If so, you can still access it - go to the App Store -> your account -> purchases -> My purchases -> search for Pax. If you have downloaded it using your account in the past, it will still be there.

If you don’t and you have a friend who has a Pax/Pax Era and has the app on their iPhone - you can also have them log into their account on your phone. Then you can download it using the same steps, log out of theirs and back into yours, and it will still be on your phone."
iPhone12,I still get push notifications in low power mode?
iPhone12,Were you using YouTube? YouTube blocks PiP for everything.
iPhone12,"I see you fixed it, but for anyone else looking - search “call audio routing” in settings and change to Bluetooth or automatic."
iPhone12,"If they’re MagSafe cases, they’ll work. If they aren’t, the magnet might not stick properly."
iPhone12,"If it’s a screen issue, they’ll just replace the screen."
iPhone12,"If you bought it through the carrier it’s a 14 limit. Apple has a longer return policy. But, if it turns out that this is a hardware issue and not a software issue - it will be covered by Apple’s warranty regardless, so you’ll be able to swap out the phone with Apple. 

I did a try on some other post with another video like this, and my screen didn’t do the flicker thing. But, I just tried it again here at the half brightness and it did flicker. So I think it’s a software related thing with the brightness levels rather than the screen - as it doesn’t do it at all with the brightness the whole way up, and there’s a faint glow if it’s the whole way down.

Either way - I’m confident Apple will take care of the issue regardless. And I’d suggest buying AppleCare regardless - then you’re covered no matter what happens to the phone."
iPhone12,"Not everybody has it - my 12 does not have this issue at all. However, apparently Apple believes that it is a software issue and not a hardware issue. If you can wait for a software update, I’d do that before swapping it out."
iPhone12,"It’s only $29 to replace the screen with Apple care, with 2 incidents a year. Personally for me, I’d rather pay the money to repair the screen than invest in a skin that might not have much of an effect."
iPhone12,"Watch some of the drop tests with the 12; the 12 withstands an INSANE amount of drops. If you’re going careless, you’ll want to get AppleCare regardless - I’d suggest not worrying about what a little skin will do if you’ve got AppleCare."
iPhone12,"If it ends up being hardware, Apple will swap out the phone no problem."
iPhone12,"Yes - search it on Reddit/Google. Lots of these issues it seems, and probably software related as opposed to hardware."
iPhone12,"Apps don’t really “run” in the background on the iPhone. You’re not actually multitasking, so the apps you aren’t currently running at the moment take up next to no RAM."
iPhone12,"The screens on the 12 series are warmer - I dunno what your mini looked like, but it seems all of the screens are warmer than previous phones. I have the 12 - and it’s definitely noticeably lighter than the Pro."
iPhone12,"People here are saying that Apple won’t switch out the phones right now. I have the 12 as well, I like the weight and the matte bezels. I do miss the telephoto lens and wish the screen had that little extra brightness factor though."
iPhone12,"The screen is warmer than the previous ones, but the screen is not yellow. Supposedly Apple will not change out the phone though, as too many people were trying to exchange phones. The first few days I had the phone, it did seem more yellow - I think that there’s some calibration happening as you use the phone. I noticed the same kinda thing when I got my X 3 years ago though."
airpods,"If the warranty started before they bought the AirPods, then it would be fake. Even if they took a legit serial number - if you search it and it’s a stolen serial, you’ll still be able to tell based on the warranty."
airpods,"Just [search the serial on Apple’s site](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/). If they’re legit AirPods, the serial will come up. If they’re fake, it won’t."
iPhoneX,"If the screen size is too small - you should try the ProMax. The extra .3 inches of space really is not all that noticeable to me, coming from an X to a 12."
iPhone12,"Could be, but my I compared it side by side with my 12 - it was still clearly worse on my display. FWIW - it happens less when my display brightness is higher. I had the X before this, and it didn’t do it at all."
iPhone12,"Yes, probably - just like the majority of people won’t care about LIDAR. For me personally, the screen makes more of a difference than the LIDAE would. Pretty much everyone glosses over the brightness when talking about the differences - but the whites look whiter and everything just seems smoother on the screen. 

For example, [in dark mode on my 12, on most of Apple’s app’s (settings, Apple Store, Clock, etc.) with the actual black background and gray bars, the grays keep flickering purple.](https://imgur.com/gallery/xg7QZ6w) The pro at Best Buy didn’t seem to do that nearly as much as my 12. It felt like just a better display all around."
iPhone12,"The screen is brighter too. I got the 12, and kinda wish I got the pro for that little extra brightness. It's not a HUGE difference, but when putting them next to each other on full brightness - it's pretty clear."
apple,"Of all time - the iPhone X will always be my favorite. It really introduced the new era of the phones, but the design still perfectly captured where the phone began."
iPhone12,"It's an X, XS, or 11 (probably an 11 if I had to guess) - they have the curved edges. The 12 has square edges, it looks nothing like this photo."
iPhone12,It's definitely not an iPhone 12.
airpods,You should be able to use the AirPods with any device running iOS 10 or above. You have to have an iPhone 7 or above though to use the newer features the latest upgrade brings (spatial audio and auto switching).
airpods,"They’re lying to you to try and not have to match the price. I’ve had the same thing happen at Walmart. You just gotta pull up their online price match terms and show them that they’re lying to you.

apple,".....no, I still have the chime on mine"
iPhoneX,"I'm not sure what basic needs are going to suddenly cease being provided by AT&T, and the AT&T service in my area is better than Verizon's. My needs through AT&T is for them to provide service and data - I am sure that AT&T will not cease providing phone service and data. I also have a huge discount with AT&T that I am positive that Verizon will never match. I pay  $100 for the highest unlimited plan for 2 devices, device fees and taxes included. I don't pay more for the service. 

For me, unless Verizon cuts their prices in half, I will not be saving money on Verizon."
iPhoneX,Some people are okay with paying for the service that actually works.
iPhoneX,Because there's often carrier deals to get a discounted rate on paying off the phone. My girlfriend has an iPhone 11. It's $10 a month over 30 months - which comes out to $300. Buying the phone outright is $600. We're paying half price for the phone by not buying it outright.
iPhone12,"The case is fantastic, the packaging is a box with a picture of the back of the case on it. Looks like every other Apple box."
iPhone12,In the rain? At the pool/beach/lake/river? Do you never experience water outside of the shower...?
iPhone12,Isn’t the deductible always $99 for accidental damage that isn’t just the screen?
television,"The show is owned by Viacom, so unless Chappelle worked out some kinda deal to get the rights back for the show - Viacom is the one licensing it out to Netflix, not him. Likely he's working on a podcast, but probably not likely that Netflix got the show in a deal with the podcast."
iPhoneX,"It feels like the screen is much more vibrant, and the colors much more clear, but the brightness feels less bright. It isn't less bright though when you put the two phones next to each other though - it's just a different screen. 

I guess it seems like there's less blue light coming out of the screen. I always had night shift turned up to full on my X, but I've only been using night shift turned up half way on the 12 because it feels like the screen is naturally warmer already."
iPhoneX,"You don't need to believe the 5G hype, but I'm right now getting 260mbps speeds in a pretty rural area... So I sure believe it."
iPhoneX,The 8 is the same age as the X...
iPhoneX,"I'm pretty sure you don't get 5G, unlimited data, HBO Max, hotspot data, etc. for $23 a month though."
iPhoneX,"You might be able to get some discounts too, depending on where you work or go to school. My job is included in the AT&T Signature Program, so that knocks off $10 from the most expensive plan making it $75 (includes HBO Max, HD video, and 30GB hotspot), and then the cheaper plan is $65 for me."
iPhoneX,"You have to have one of the newer unlimited plans, but that seems to be the plan stipulation. I was told that as long as you're on one of the new wireless plans and you have an X or above, you are able to trade in. It's credited over the 30 months though, so you can't just trade in the phone and switch off of AT&T once the new phone comes."
iPhoneX,"The only thing that's taking a little bit of getting used to for me is the lack of 3D Touch and the new screen. The screen looks better than the X and the colors look fantastic, it's just a different OLED - I don't know exactly how to explain it."
iPhoneX,"Well you can always get the AT&T Next if you want to upgrade sooner. You're always going to be locked in for 30 months unless you pay the extra $5 a month or buy your phone outright. With the trade in and AT&T next you're only paying $5 a month, and you can upgrade to the iPhone 13 if you're worried about next year's phone blowing the 12 out of the water or whatever. I, however, am not worried about that."
iPhoneX,"The iPhone X street value right now is like $350-400. The trade in deal gives you an $800 phone for the trade in of a $400 phone. A year from now, you'll be very lucky to get $400 for the phone, I don't see how you'd get more value for your phone by selling it next year as opposed to taking advantage of the trade in deal.

My X is perfectly fine as well, but I decided to go for it because I can't sell my iPhone X for $800. I feel like I'm losing money not taking advantage of the trade! haha"
iPhoneX,"I did this as well, and there was no box sent to ship it back in either. I doubt they're gonna send out another box, I'll probably end up going to the AT&T store in the next week or so if I hear nothing else about it."
iPhoneX,I believe they're pushing this deal to get more AT&T subscribers onto 5G plans. I'd be surprised if they did a free iPhone for an X trade in next year. The oldest iPhone you can trade in for the deal this year is the X.

You can clearly see that T-Mobile screwed something up big.

Other than that, there’s like millions of these devices out there. Some will get scratched, it happens."
iPhoneX,Especially when the battery is $70 - it’s not worth saving $70 to worry so much about the battery’s condition.
iphone,"Same, so glad I stuck with the white haha. I got the plum silicone case too and it looks awesome."
iphone,"I ordered mine through AT&T but a similar thing happened. It had “Preparing to Ship” as the status since I had bought it, with 10/23 as the delivery date. Last night it changed the delivery date, and still said it was being prepared.

It didn’t change to “Shipped” until a few hours before delivery, and then showed with the full details that it actually had shipped out on the 21st. Obviously Apple’s site will be different than AT&T’s - but the phones are all coming from the same places."
iphone,"I’m just a guy so I don’t have any insight, but my phone definitely shipped out on the 21st via FedEX, but the AT&T app didn’t change “preparing to ship” to “shipped” until literally a few hours before it was delivered. Last night it was showing mine wouldn’t be delivered today too as it hasn’t shipped yet, but the AT&T site was clearly wrong."
iphone,"Pre-ordered my through AT&T last week - and the status was ""Preparing to ship"" with a delivery date of October 23 all through last night. The delivery date changed last night to an unknown date, still with ""preparing to ship.""

A few hours ago, it updated and said the phone actually shipped out on October 21st, and is currently out for delivery. If you have something similar with AT&T happen - it's possible it's just something wrong with their system."
iphone,"I ordered through AT&T too. Up until a few hours ago, my status was ""Preparing to Ship"" and then sometime yesterday evening my delivery date changed from ""October 23"" to an unknown date.

A few hours ago it updated and said the phone actually shipped out on October 21st, and is on the delivery truck on it's way to my house. 

It could be delayed, it it could be AT&T's system."

politics,"We didn’t really scrub anything - what happened was we were rushed with reports on those articles as well, and got a lot of users asking why those weren’t being removed if they were off topic too. So we removed them as we had missed them before, and were being reported as off topic when Cain died."
Emo,"I’m sure all 3 of these teenager’s ~~fans~~ friends will be devastated, just devastated."
iPhoneX,"You said you have an Apple Watch in the other post? If that’s connected, it’s using Bluetooth. Are your headphones Bluetooth or wired? Do you have good reception where you’re walking? How long have you had it/what’s the battery percentage at? There’s a whole lot of factors there beyond “only playing music.” 10 hours of battery life playing music really isn’t that terrible for a 3 year old phone. That’s pretty much where my battery has been at for a while."
iPhoneX,"10% an hour is 10 hours of battery life, that’s pretty good..."
LiveFromNewYork,"I really like Bill Burr, and I’m a big fan of stand up, but I find a lot of his specials super hit and miss."
LiveFromNewYork,"Haha there isn’t software that is able to separate audio tracks like that, and the results would be pretty shit if there were. It’s a very, very, very different recording process, and separating out a vocal track from instruments is not really comparable to what would need to be done on an SNL tape. It would be more akin to trying to separate out the 3rd guitar parts from the rest of the audio. Remember that they didn’t record television to tape like they did a movie, so really all they have is the original broadcasts. Most likely just the straight video and audio - both in pretty low quality.


Again though, 99% of the time it’s not background music, but an actual part of the sketch. Plus, they would still need to license music to replace any music with new music. It’s just not a thing that’s really possible to do unfortunately.

The blame should be put on how shit the music industry has run itself for the past 50 years rather than NBC."
LiveFromNewYork,"You can't just purchase song rights - there's a lot more to music copyrights and licensing than paying a fee to use a song. To do that with every musical guest/every sketch that has a song in it would be damn near impossible (nearly 900 episodes means almost 1,800 song licenses just for musical guests - plus another ~5,000+ songs for sketches, it would be nearly all in all nearly 10,000 licenses to obtain). It sucks, but that's the biz."
LiveFromNewYork,"It's got tunes from Les Mis, I'd bet that's the reason. It's still on YouTube, though."
LiveFromNewYork,"I mean, basically the entire Trump episode is online - so they're definitely not just editing out shitty sketches..."
LiveFromNewYork,"That takes a lot of time and manpower, and also requires getting new licensing agreements for the new music they use unless they’re using in house created music. It’s also possible there are other licensing deals or something of that nature involved as well. There’s a lot of sketches where the music isn’t just background music, it’s the focus of the sketch. [Or sketches where they actually sing a song - that kinda thing can't be replaced or overdubbed.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MC6xjO1JoR8)

Edit:
Scratch that, I forgot that this definitely wouldn't be possible because they have to play the songs/music in the background during the actual sketch in the studio - so they wouldn't be able to separate out the music from the cast mics."
LiveFromNewYork,"Probably also licensing agreements related to music or something. If a sketch has music that is licensed in it, they have to have the license still to post it. For example, if they sing a portion of a song in a sketch - they’d have to remove that sketch if they don’t have the license."
LiveFromNewYork,"Many sketches use music too. The only real solution would be for SNL to only use in-house created music for all of the sketches, which would be pretty unrealistic."
LiveFromNewYork,"Yeah, video games are super weird with the licensing too. If the license for the music runs out, they've gotta pull sales and remove from online.

Based on what's on Peacock - I'd guess that the deal for the music in the first 5 seasons was different. Recently, I'll bet it's a 5 year licensing deal - as the latest 5 seasons are the only recent ones with musical guests."
LiveFromNewYork,"Music is weird, a lot of times it's not a matter of paying for the music - it's a matter of labels not licensing it to them at all. They may license it for a short number of years on reruns and whatnot, but then they might not allow them to renew the license. If that's the case, there's not much NBC can do there."

I believe that would actually violate the App Store rules, and they can probably get banned completely for doing that if Apple was to notice that it's a work around to get around their store rules.

I would assume Pax doesn't want to take that chance and would rather try and get back in the App Store legitimately."

PAXvapor,"One way would be using someone’s Apple ID who already downloaded the app. If you know someone who has it, they can log into their account on your phone and download it from their history."
PAXvapor,"It doesn’t solve any issue for anyone who doesn’t have a computer, and I don’t think Pax is advertising this as such. Obviously this only works if you have a computer. Many people who do have iPhones also have computers - obviously not all. I’m sure that they will add Pax3 comparability with the Windows version soon. The Mac one launched with just the Era as well.

Unfortunately, Pax  is totally unable to make this work on the phones, as Apple doesn’t allow web Bluetooth on iPhones. It’s the best the can do at the moment because they literally have no way of putting an app on the iPhone now."

NeutralPolitics,"> Tenino's city government backs the local currency, which merchants can exchange for U.S. dollars at city hall at a 1:1 rate

They aren’t really printing their own money, as the money is backed by regular currency. The residents are basically getting credits by the local government, and then spending them at local businesses. They’re just not giving them the money directly so they have to spend it in the local businesses. It appears that the money isn’t at all circulated, and is just used one time. Businesses do not have to accept it, but that would be silly - as they get to exchange it for money.

Essentially, they’re just using local tax money to stimulate the economy - but not giving out a direct cash stimulus to the citizens.

[This article](https://thehustle.co/covid19-local-currency-tenino-washington/) talks more about other types of local currencies as well - so there are even current examples. 

The pros are that the economy is stimulated, the businesses are still making money, and people have a bit extra to spend. The cons are they they can’t buy alcohol or cannabis with it..."

politics,"I said nothing about the media though, and I agree - the media shouldn’t just focus on Trump. They should focus on everyone involved.

Here is a direct statement made by Trump, where he even flat out states that Epstein likes young girls:

>“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, **and many of them are on the younger side**. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Trump has spread that he banned Epstein for sexually assaulting a masseuse at Maralago, not for hitting on underage women. However, this has been disputed, and other accounts state that they had a [falling out over business] (https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20190802/palm-beach-estate-bankruptcy-auction-pitted-trump-epstein). Either way, it seems you haven’t looked much into that, and you really should.

The reason for the falling out though doesn’t really matter. Clinton rode on Epstein’s plane many times, yes, but Epstein visited Trump - and Trump visited Epstein as well. We have pictures and videos of this. According to the flight logs, Trump also took flights on the Lolita Express. I mean, Trump even stated many years ago that he knew that Epstein liked girls “on the younger side.” That is in no way “small in comparison.”

This isn’t about the media. It’s about a double standard. Again, why does Trump get a full pass from you while others don’t? None of them should get passes on this one. It doesn’t matter who it is or what their political beliefs are, nobody should be given a pass here."
politics,"What about Trump’s clear ties to Epstein, and the partying he did with Epstein (and the “suspected” dirt you mention includes dirt on Trump)? You keep talking about the Clintons - and insinuate that maybe he was murdered by them - but Trump has the same ties. Why? Is this simply because Clinton is a Democrat and Trump is a Republican, so that absolves him? What’s with the double standard on this?"

politics,"Clearing your cookies works to reset the count, you can even just choose to clear cookies for Washington Post by itself if you don’t want to clear all your cookies."
politics,"Sports and politics are pretty different. We’re talking about two very different types of subs here with two very different types of content posted. Stats and things don’t change, games of scores don’t change, etc. I would assume a sports sub would allow analysis of, for example, a trade in football by multiple different sources that each give differing views, and not just allow only one article about the trade. 

Lots of information and opinion can very significantly between articles or publications, especially in politics. Things change very quickly as well, and topics get updated as new developments unfold - a political sub and a sports sub just are entirely different ballgames."
politics,"I'll make this easy and spell it out a little bit:

Opinions that align traditionally with conservatives, or with Trump, get downvoted regularly in r/politics - this is a simple fact. Whether those views are conservative views on abortion rights, taxes, global warming, gun rights, support for Trump, you name it - these often get downvoted. 

Opinions that more traditionally align with liberals tend to get upvoted.  

This is simply demonstrably true. Are you asking us to prove that everyone who says something that aligns with a conservative view is, in fact, conservative? We can't do that, because that wouldn't be true. Nor did we ever at any point say that was the case. However, if someone who is not a conservative says something that would traditionally align with conservatives, this is usually downvoted and met with hostility saying the user is ""trolling."" 

We couldn't care less what the political affiliation of other users are. We don't look into that at all when making decisions. If something violates the rules, we remove it. It's that simple."
politics,"As I stated above, how are we supposed to decide which article gets left? And how many? What happens if that article then gets downvoted and all other articles on the topic are removed? What about opinions on the topic? What about an article that adds more than another? Is it the first submission? Or the first one upvoted to the front page? See how there's an issue here?

How do you decide what are the ""best quality"" or ""high quality"" articles? And then, we'd be inserting our opinion as to what article might be the ""best."" That's not something we are comfortable doing here.

That kind of rule would be a very good way to get news stories brigaded and buried, as it would only take brigading on one post. We also simply don't have the resources to only allow one submission per topic, as that would require a ton of work. We allow the voting to take care of it. What you see upvoted is what users have upvoted there."
politics,".......that was literally addressed in the same comment, but okay, ignore all of that.

And, for the record, Breitbart was never banned here. They were permitted before the whitelist, as well."
politics,"What you see upvoted is what the users upvote, and this means that when story comes out, you might see more than one version on the front page. We wouldn’t feel right limiting only one submission per topic, as different articles across different sources will contain different analysis, explanations, opinions, etc. How would we decide what one story on a subject remains? We let the voting take care of that.

 Megathreads serve the purpose of consolidating large stories, but only when something threatens to take up a high percentage of the front page."
politics,"We couldn't care less about ""pissing off the wrong crowd."" We don't remove the sites because they fit within our rules, period. To suggest it has something to do with a ""backlash"" is simply false - and something you've made up entirely yourself - full stop.

If we felt that any of those sites suddenly stopped meeting our requirements, they would be removed. This isn't the case, so they remain whitelisted - which we have discussed throughout this thread over and over again."
politics,"I'm not sure about this meta thread, but there have been many calls to remove The Federalist from the whitelist in the past. I can quote you modmails asking us to remove the Federalist. Also, check out the comment section of many submitted articles from The Federalist and you will find many similar comments to ones asking to remove other right-wing sites from the whitelist."
politics,"It’s not a different answer, and we are on the same page. The question was asking if it is uncivil to accuse someone on one side of the isle of being on the other side. If the comment is uncivil, it would be against the rules. If the comment is not uncivil, it wouldn’t be.

For example, if these were said to a liberal whom another user disagreed with:

>You’re parroting right wing talking points someone fed you.

-

>You sound just like a Trump supporter

Uncivil.

>I’ve also heard this being spread by the far right.

-

>I have seen Trump supporters also say this as well.

Not uncivil.

See the difference here?"
politics,"We have absolutely no rules on “fake news.” Any site which meets our requirements is added to the whitelist, plain and simple."
politics,"This was something that we adopted from the admins. The admins relaxed their rules regarding diversifying sources and what is considered “spam” in that regard, and thus we did as well."
politics,"It’s important to note that this isn’t just a news sub, and we don’t say that it is. This is a sub for political discussion, and that includes discussion of opinions and speculation rather than only discussion of straight news. We do not judge the veracity of reporting."
politics,"Anyone using hate speech or advocating violence earns an instant permanent ban. If you see that, report the comments."
politics,"We cannot change the name of the sub, and it is only for US politics. So, that’s why you only see US politics."
politics,"We would too. Have you read through this metathread, though? You’ll quite unfortunately find that many users simply believe conservative voices should be banned outright, and just argue with us when we tell them this. We’re trying man, we’re really trying! It’s an uphill battle."
politics,"I'm not sure where we said the ""merit of the source was in question."" But our whitelist requirements do not go on ""merit."" As the domain meets the requirements, we allow it. It has nothing to do with the ""merit"" of the articles or our personal opinions on the articles."
politics,"Do you have links to the conversation? On review of the site, its not a site that focuses on US politics, and looks that nearly all of it would be off topic. We don’t add foreign sites that don’t have a significant amount of on topic articles."
politics,"I just went through our whitelist form. The first time that NGA was requested was the beginning of this year. We review submissions for the whitelist about once every six months, and I can tell you that that simply hasn’t been reviewed yet. It didn’t get lost, it didn’t get eliminated."
politics,"What site exactly are you referring to, and why would a mod randomly message you saying that? Do you have more details here/ the conversation that took place?"
politics,"The bot can only run every few minutes, so it only scans the submissions every few minutes. Automod is faster as that is part of Reddit and instantaneous."
politics,"Reaction time on what, exactly?"
politics,"It can be, and is, ignored though. Reporting just sends us a link, and then if it’s a false report - it just gets approved, and the report gets ignored. If it’s a form of protest, it’s entirely ineffective and will get you nowhere."
politics,"And we’ll go right ahead and ignore those reports, and then actual reports will get missed. Reporting something because you want it removed from the whitelist will have absolutely zero bearing on whether something gets removed from the whitelist.

Users ask us why we miss reports all the time, one good reason is that many reports we get are false reports we then have to take time to check."
politics,"Being so freaking frustrated man that it freaking hurts!!

It’s no secret that there are some subs that constantly just link to here. SPS is a great example, that’s their entire thing. To link to comments here. We’ve brought many threads of theirs to the admins, and in some cases the admins have stepped in to help us out there. The unfortunate truth with the admins and brigading is, they actually have a pretty narrow definition of “brigading.” In order for them to take action, usually a comment or submission has to not only link to somewhere else, but also come with a call to action to go and participate somewhere else too. Simple links don’t count.

With that said, if someone was to come from SPS and then start commenting here, we would consider this to be brigading. They know better than that. With voting though, the admins don’t give us any access to prevent that, unfortunately. You would have to bring those directly to them."
politics,"ShareBlue was banned for a very specific reason, though. The employees in question with that removed all of the “evidence” themself (deleted everything from their profiles), and asked that we kept their name and username out of it. If you dig enough, you can find it - but out of privacy to the people in question here, we decided not to release names or usernames."
politics,"This has been addressed many times in this thread. We do not make decisions based on what content a website produces. We allow many left wing websites that users on the right ask us to remove in the same way as the calls from the left for Breitbart.

What “left wing sites” have we removed from the whitelist that Breitbart or The Daily Wire would also fall under?"
politics,"You must be aware that we are the ones who created that requirement, so yes, it is supported by the rules of this sub."
politics,"Regardless of the number, any broadcast television news network that is broadcast nationally by major cable/dish services will be allowed on r/politics."
politics,"Yes, the admins were able to confirm with us and they shadowbanned many of the accounts at the time."
politics,"They are broadcast nationally as a news network reaching 35 million homes, so they do satisfy that criteria."
politics,"Any coordinated upvoting can be considered manipulation, it would depend on the situation. As moderators, we cannot see how users vote, and we aren’t given any access to the voting system. When we notice something we bring that to the admins to check on, and they can confirm whether or not something is going on there. 

As a sub, we do have disclosure rules - so any account being run by a publication or journalist must be disclosed to us so we can flair them transparently. If a user or organization is caught trying to get around our disclosure rules, this could result in a ban on the user or publication."
politics,"Vote manipulation on Reddit can mean a few things, mostly we use it to refer to when a person/organization engages in tactics to manipulate their vote score on a post. This can be by using many “dummy” accounts to artificially vote on something, or by using bots to manipulate the vote scores by automatically upvoting content.

Search engine optimization is when a site tries to increase their positive visibility on search engines. This can be done by way of manipulating vote scores on Reddit, as the more engagement a post has on Reddit, the higher it will appear on a search engine."
politics,"Specifically, vote manipulation and search engine optimization tactics."
politics,"I can tell you it came up recently, and it was voted down once again. There is little support, I can’t say none, but very little support for readding any source that engaged in any sort of manipulation tactics. It’s one of the few things that will really get a site permanently banned on our sub. Once a site does so, it gives us very little reason to ever add them back.

Resubmitting the form will not raise a chance of a site being added, and can be considered an abuse of the form. Requesting a site more than once slows down our actual process for approving sites. Especially requesting sites that do not qualify for the whitelist."
politics,"TYT broke our rules against spam and SEO, which is how they earned a subreddit ban in our case - thus, we do not allow them into the whitelist. They themselves caused their ban here by engaging in backhanded manipulation tactics."
politics,"A novelty account is defined for our purposes as a username with a matching schtick. So, if a username was “IAnswerWithHistoricalQuotes,” and their comments are all historical quotes, this would be a novelty account. 

A user with the name “IAmARepublican” posting comments that align with their views would not be a novelty account - unless they had some matching schtick with every comment. IE every comment began with “I am a Republican and .....”"
politics,Opinions about politics or the Trump administration are not off topic.
politics,"You can downvote an article if you don’t like the contents, but if you see something upvoted - it’s because the users have upvoted it. We only remove something if it violates our rules."
politics,We do have an r/politics chat room on Reddit which serves this purpose!
politics,"Hello - I am the mod who responded to your modmail and reapproved that submission for you. I’m glad you messaged us, as we were able to get on that quickly, as it was an incorrect removal and also the top post on the sub at the time.

That post had many reports on it, not just one or two. It had at least 10. Our soliciting rules can be kinda hard, and a newer mod saw that link and believed it to be soliciting as per how soliciting has been discussed. With articles about demonstrations like that, the line can be a little blurry.

Posts on the front page tend to get more reports just by the nature of their visibility."
politics,"Yes, this is a function of a few things. One of which is the number of mods - in order to keep up with the thousands of reports we get a day, we would need hundreds of moderators here. We’re a team of 40ish people, and we’re all simple volunteers who all have jobs, family, friends, and our own lives which do take precedent over being a moderator.

There are times, especially during the weekends, where there won’t be many moderators watching the report queue and it may take a while for something reported to be actioned. There may be other times of the day were there are multiple mods reviewing the queue, and something might be actioned more quickly. 

If you see something that is hate speech and truly bad, you can send us a modmail if it doesn’t seem to be actioned after a reasonable amount of time."
politics,"Those threads are just to announce a rule change, after we have discussed and voted on it, so users are aware of our rule changes.

Those threads are not metathreads, and thus, they direct you to modmail if you have questions and concerns. When you see a rule change, be aware that it happens after much deliberating and discussion."
politics,"Yes, but that isn’t due to how we run the sub. That’s due to user voting, which is how Reddit as a whole runs and it’s no secret Reddit skews liberal.

However, r/politics is a place to discuss politics on all sides. We do not moderate the sub that way, and all views are welcome."
politics,"Without seeing the comments, it’s hard to address why they were removed - but I can go through some common reasons as to why that might happen based on your description.

I’ll start with the links. For one, all shortened links are automatically removed by the admins tools - this includes youtube short links that YouTube themself creates when you share a video. That could be what’s happening. 

As for the swearing, that probably isn’t because of the swearing but because of the phrase. For example, if you said “go fuck yourself [insert person here]” or “you’re a piece of shit, _______,” these night get removed by automod for potential incivility, because 99% of the time when these phrases are used they’re towards a user and uncivil. 

The bot simply isn’t smart enough to be able to decipher between a personal attack on a user, and that same phrase being used towards a public figure. To be clear again, incivility towards public figures (provided it doesn’t break one of our other rules) is permitted. This may he why a comment wasn’t appearing at first, but then did after it was approved later."
politics,"Now I KNOW this isn’t the answer you’re looking for, but I’ll be honest here - the answer is, unfortunately, yes.

Before heads roll here, this isn’t a subreddit problem - this is a Reddit issue. We as moderators cannot see anything more into an account than you can, literally. The only thing we can see on an account that you can’t is which comments in r/politics are removed. 

We have no IP tools, no ways to determine where a poser is posting from, or if a poster is legitimate or a paid entity. 

What I can say, is the admins have assured us time and time again that this has not been found to be a massive issue. This is what the admins have told us. 

Now, again, we know these accounts can be out there - but there’s nothing we can do to identify them as moderators. If you see something suspicious, report it at Reddit.com/report and the admins will investigate. Moderators, unfortunately, have no investigative tools here."
politics,"We do not have a “swear bot” that sends things to us for review. Automoderator reports certain comments or removes certain comments which have uncivil phrases in it, but we allow swearing. I’m also not sure what you mean by link jokes, but if you’re saying you’re linking to one thing and the link goes somewhere entirely different, that is a form of trolling."
politics,"Hi sorry here, I figured out your confusion. Reporting via the mobile app is not great right now, and for some reason - it seems as though it gives you options to report comments as if they are submissions. 

If you’re on mobile and you hit report, it breaks r/politics rules, then you can scroll down in the report options and choose trolling. Bad interface, but you can scroll down to find the option."
politics,"Well, they are a television news network. This satisfies this part of the requirements:

> The source is a major print media publication, television network or radio broadcaster."
politics,"We ban users daily for comments that accuse others of parroting talking points, which would be uncivil. The fact of the matter here is, when we ban a user - usually if it’s for incivility, they receive a one day ban. It might also might take a while to get to the report, so you might not notice action taken there. It’s also possible we miss a comment, as we do get thousands upon thousands of reports per day, and we’re just a small team of volunteers."
politics,"We have rules against incivility. We do not have rules against people having a different opinion than other users, or for believing conspiracy theories. If someone is propagating a conspiracy theory that includes hate speech, or incivility towards another user, we take actions. We do not take action on accounts that may have political opinions to the right, and that includes users who may believe something you do not.

This is a sub for all sides of politics, we are not a liberal subreddit. Reporting comments that don’t break the rules will not result in action taken against them."
politics,Send us a modmail with the username and we can check it out. There’s no way to address this comment without knowing who you reported.
politics,"If you have evidence of vote manipulation like this, you should take it to the admins and report at Reddit.com/report. Moderators have no way of controlling or seeing user voting - and we don’t even have access to the algorithms the admins use with voting.

In other words, there isn’t anything moderators can do from preventing any user from voting. We also have no further access to see an account than you do, and we can’t “shadowban” a user, only the admins can do that. We also don’t have access to user IP addresses or anything like that, so that’s not something we have the ability to target either. 

I’m sure this isn’t the answer you’re looking for, but the admins do watch for vote manipulation and they do take action when they catch it. What we’ve been told, however, is that mostly that happens because users are actually voting, and with tens of thousands of active users at any time - any number of thousands of people can be voting at any time."

I can’t speak for all the mods, we haven’t implemented an abbreviation test - but I’m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they don’t actually believe it stands for ***F***emale ***B***ody ***I***nvestigator like those popular beach shirts might have one assume. I myself am the grandson of a former Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent, so I definitely can at least some solid understanding of the Bureau - he helped take down some guy on the most wanted list or something cool like that.

Now here’s where it’s gonna get tricky. I agree with my fellow compadre who removed that one. It’s off topic. Not everything the FBI does will be on topic - them classifying hate groups is, unfortunately, not politically motivated (no matter what caughsomecaugh might want us to believe)... Thus, it’s really not a political action and it has no political consequences. Bad news first, as they say.

So the good news (!!!) is that this isn’t the only submission about that - and there are some that are on topic and framed in a political light! But that’s not all - with our new and improved shiny “rehosted” rule ready to be shown off - it makes it easier for other submissions like this (and in the future!!) to be submitted. All that we need is that other article to also have a political focus/internal discussion of politics. So, stay with me, you’ve come this far, let’s say a submission on this topic also had a discussion about Trump **and** his approach to right wing extremism? That would be on topic, and you can find that submission here:

politics,"This has been discussed before, and a mod wrote something to do that and ran into a lot of issues with unicode vs ASCII (and then another mod tried to explain what that meant to us mods who don’t understand what that means but I assume you will be able to because you sound like a code literate kinda guy). And then there were issues with the other minutia of our title rules (like dropping time words), and a few other things you need not be bored with while I try to describe in non-mod speak.

However - if you noticed above, we changed our title rules with this metathead (one of the biggest reasons we’re having it, yay!!). We now allow subtitles to be used along with the headline, so that would run into many false positives :(."
politics,"Spez said earlier he might look into a way to automatically update submission titles as a change is made by the website, which would fix any issue there."
politics,"This wasn’t new accounts - this was across all accounts, including old accounts. As stated in that paragraph, we were temporarily removing any users with less than 100 karma sitewide. As a result, we’ve changed that now to target users with higly negative karma, and have focused more on newer accounts. It’s not perfect, but we are finding the error rates to be much lower."
politics,"Spez said earlier he’s going to try and work on a way that titles could be automatically updated after submission as the site changes the titles or something along those lines. If the admins were to do that, we would be able to update the titles as changes are made from the site itself. We have no intentions of changing the one submission per URL policy, however."
politics,"Right, I tried to address that. We do not allow resubmissions of articles even if the source has updated the text/headline - the original submission would still be the one we allow. It’s not because of automod (however it would not be possible for automod to detect that), we simply allow one submission per URL."
politics,"As I stated in another reply: We allow one submission per URL, even if that article is later updated or the headline is changed - in that case we flair it “site-altered headline.” Articles can be updated 5 times, and the headline can change 5 times. We don’t want duplicate submissions of articles, as this can cause the same article to appear multiple times. Especially if it’s an article that reaches the front page, it could result in the same article on the front page many times.

"
politics,"1. As you may have noticed, this is mentioned in the rule: “Do not include the organization name, extraneous quotes, or the article section.” We will continue enforcing the rule on submissions which include things like that. The only thing this will change is the ability to add subtitles, and the biggest reason for the change is that many times the subtitle provides a lot more context to the actual article. The rule is not intended to allow any other changes to the title.

2. What you’re talking about here is an update to an article - not a duplicate. What we mean by duplicate is the exact copy/paste of an article from one source to another. We allow one submission per URL, even if that article is later updated or the headline is changed - in that case we flair it “site-altered headline.” Articles can be updated 5 times, and the headline can change 5 times. We don’t want duplicate submissions of articles, as this can cause the same article to appear multiple times. Especially if it’s an article that reaches the front page, it could result in the same article on the front page many times."

politics,"We would agree on the vast majority of these articles, and most are off topic. This one, however, has a fair amount of political discussion: 

>Iowa's two GOP U.S. senators also described Tibbetts' death as a tragedy ""that could have been prevented,"" and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said residents were heartbroken and angry.


>""We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can to bring justice to Mollie's killer,"" Reynolds, a Republican, said in a statement.

>Trump has made further crackdown on illegal immigration a core policy of his administration. He often has claimed widespread crime by people living in the country illegally, citing among other things the indictments of 11 suspected MS-13 gang members from El Salvador charged in connection with the slayings of two Virginia teens. Trump also has held events at the White House with members of ""angel families,"" whose relatives were killed by immigrants.


>Although Trump claims legal U.S. residents are less likely to commit crime, several studies from social scientists and the libertarian think tank Cato Institute find that isn't accurate and states with a higher share of people living in the country illegally have lower violent crime rates.


>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that it lodged a federal immigration detainer for Rivera after he was arrested on the murder charge. That move means the agency has probable cause to believe he is subject to deportation.
