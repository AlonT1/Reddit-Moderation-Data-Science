Autos,"Yes, Civil Asset Forfeiture (It's stealing, these people didn't forfeit anything) doesn't require that the person be guilty of, or even charged with, anything. The police charge the inanimate object. It is guilty then until the owner proves beyond a doubt that the object was legally obtained.   


It's an asinine system and police teach each other how to use it to fund their departments and get more toys. It's nuts."
Autos,"Yes, they can take your home too."

PokemonGoFriends,"Yes. I'm in the US, so basically to get Uxie I need to be on in the evenings to late night. By morning, things are about done in that region. Got plenty of Azelf and Mesprit opportunities during the day and early evening, though."

PoliticalHumor,"To be frank, isn’t their entire message about a desire to encroach upon the right of others?

A democratically elected body in Charlottesville signed off on their ability to protest the decision of same body to remove a memorial. Said protest ended with the removal of the right of living drone one person. Said removal was committed by a Nazi. 

Where does their right to dipshittery intersect the rights of others to live?  Or where do their rights supersede the rights of a democratically elected body to enact policy? We’re these protesters constituents?"
PoliticalHumor,"Yes. They absolutely have the right to go do this in public. 

And be mocked for it."
PoliticalHumor,Right. And keep passing pics of their dipshittery to friends and employers. I assume they are proud of these beliefs. They will welcome news that everyone knows they are Nazis.

politics,"The Uihleins (Liz and Richard) make some questionable political campaign donations. 

“Uihlein was one of the few major donors to cut a check to support Moore after several women accused Moore of making advances when they were as young as 14. Uihlein donated $100,000 to a pro-Moore super PAC. But his contribution to the race overall was bigger than that: Uihlein also donated $500,000 last year to Senate Conservatives Action, which spent $400,000 in favor of Moore in the race.”

Also, Liz and husband Richard Uihlein  utterly loathe unions."

EngineBuilding,"As others have said, yes, assuming you could exactly match the speed and offset the firing by exactly 180. Basically put them all on a common crankshaft. And thus recreate a four cylinder.

Though you’d get some small differences due to no scavenging from the exhaust header being spilt up and different induction noise from independent intakes."
projectcar,"Yeah. They had a handle and the whole thing pulled out. 

And then what? You take it into the bar?"
OakIsland,"We found a penny at the bottom. 

This is significant."
EngineBuilding,Not the molecules. It’s about grain or crystalline structure size. Steels develop different grain size based on heating and cooling parameters and this heavily impacts properties like brittleness and elasticity.
projectcar,I’ve been looking for a smallish project car. How is the parts market for this? Parts primarily from Opel/Europe or a lot of domestic GM stuff?
Autos,"They can’t “self seal” lithium ion batteries.

Lithium Titanite or LTO batteries, however you could drive a nail through while operating.

Oh. Yeah. She did that in her official capacity as Press Secretary for Kirsten Nielsen (put a j in her name somewhere I can’t be bothered to look it up.)

carporn,"The P2 generation cars had a different trans and AWD system. Depending on the year, some of the Austin transmissions had some issues. But that was before this 04-07 car. Primarily 01-02."
projectcar,"Ah, I see. Thank you for the great, informative response."
todayilearned,"In addition to head and flow, seasonality is a consideration. Many of the Army Corps of Engineers dams I’ve visited are highly seasonal. They could generate for 4-8 weeks out of the year. Hard to justify that return on investment in a powerhouse."
projectcar,"Honest question, have apex seals gotten any better since these were originally built? Any new materials or manufacturing capabilities that give more time between rebuilds?"
carporn,"This is a V70R. Generally reliable but a few pricy areas to watch for. The electronically adjustable shocks are exclusive to this car and get pretty pricey. They can also have some issues with the AWD unit in the rear or the bevel gear in the front that sends power to the rear. 

All in all, pretty good for a 10-15 year old car. They’re well documented by the owner community and most parts are very reasonable."
projectcar,The plan is to fix it with my son. They’re simple and fun. But he can’t get into too much trouble with a 0-60 time of 17s.
projectcar,"That’s what I’m about to pull the trigger on. A Mk I rabbit convertible sounds like a perfect first project car. Cheap. Simple. Plentiful. Fun. 

What’s not to like?"
Justrolledintotheshop,"Yeah we tend to sentimentally assign more power and quality to old cars than they actually had. 80’s cars are especially prone to this as Corvettes were sporting less than 200hp (now available on any basic sedan or the like) and Porsches 911’s we’re pumping out 205hp. 

Mid 70’s to the 80’s were a low point in power and performance. There were some bright spots and the GN was one of them. But modern engines blow them away in off-the-showroom-floor power."
Justrolledintotheshop,"Anywhere near as powerful? Buick currently uses the 3.6 rated at 313hp. The GM parts bin has the twin turbo 3.6 ready to use at 420hp. 

The 87 GNX put out 276hp. 

The 87 GNX was good for a 4.7s 0-60. The 2019 Cadillac CTS with the aforementioned turbo 3.6 gets there in 4.5. With considerably more weight. 

In short GM absolutely has the engines and platforms available to make a new GN. With better mileage. And a longer warranty. And better suspension. And navigation and hands free calling."
PoliticalHumor,He can also lie in written responses.
projectcar,I know you’re joking but many German WWII aircraft engines did run inverted vee engines. Imagine an engine where the oil is scavenging out of the valve covers to be pumped up to the crank. Wild.

Drag car start sounds about right. Not trying to be an ass, just giving you my straightforward thoughts on it."

news,"This. Get your own flag. Don recollection the actual flag. 

This goes for everyone."
democrats,"No. 

President Trump, via his administration, conditioned disbursement of Congressionally authorized funds on the public statement that the Zelenskyy administration was investigating the Bidens. And that Zelenskyy had ordered an investigation into Ukraine actually being behind 2016 election meddling, and having framed Russia for it. 

Note that I said he conditioned lawfully authorized funds on these statements. There was no tie to actual investigations. He wanted a headline. In exchange for aid. He wanted something that benefitted him politically and had no actual foreign policy aim behind it. In exchange, he would release money to a foreign government. 

In short, he wanted something of value personally in exchange for government funds being given. That’s abuse of power. 

This is not about 2016 election interference. Nor is it about investigating the Biden’s. 

It’s about a President extracting personal gain from government funds. Hence the abuse of power."

Great, try paying your rent with edgy jokes. 

Hey, at least the trainees learned something from this experience. Don’t emulate Nazis. Worthwhile lesson most people already knew."

Justrolledintotheshop,"Forgot these were the Ranger/Explorer platform.

democrats,"No. 

The “whole impeachment” is not based on “Trump wanting to investigate Biden”

We are fundamentally not saying the same thing."
PoliticalHumor,Increased education is generally considered an investment in that it results in higher earnings and specialization. Doing this at large scale would drive GDP up.
Autos,"Karmann built plenty of German automakers’ bodies. 

The Mk1 Rabbit/Golf Cabriolet/Convertible was a Karmann body and those were produced by the hundreds of thousands."
democrats,"No. The impeachment is based on abuse of power.

Trump withheld aid to extract a promise of a press conference announcing an investigation into the Bidens and Ukraine’s role in 2016 election meddling.

These are the findings of the House intel committee. These findings formed the basis of the Judiciary committee’s articles of impeachment.

It’s really a straight line from point A to Point B to Point C."
democrats,"They weren’t luxury brand prices.

Justrolledintotheshop,"Was the Aerostar available with AWD?

I know Chevy Astros could be AWD but haven’t seen an Aerostar similarly equipped."
politics,"This is largely due to the US produced soybeans being of a higher protein content. They were the preferred producer, but not at a tariffed price."
politics,"So, at BEST, things go back to 2016 when 1 in 3 soybeans grown in the Midwest are sold to China?

But only after $28B in farm subsidies, tripling farm bankruptcies and consummate increases in farm suicide. 

This is a good deal?"
politics,"And now the mines are closing too. So that’s coal and steel impacted. 

Bang up job from a POTUS that has said people like the FED should “trust his gut” over any economic metrics or expertise. Nope, trust the guy who managed to bankrupt a casino. Twice. 

Guys, I’m starting to think this President is no economic genius."

Tariffs used to not work. I mean, the still don’t, but they didn’t used to, either. 

Sadder punchline? This has resulted in record high trade deficits under the Trump administration."
Justrolledintotheshop,"Volvo killed the AW55 in their 2001 (and early 2002) V70 wagons and S60 sedans. 

They had the B4 servo issue, but the real problem is software on the TCM that would put the trans in neutral when in drive and at a stop with foot on the brake. When you took your foot off thee brake and hit the gas, it went back to first. Well, the engine could build revs faster than the shift would happen, so it was effectively a form of neutral dropping the trans. It ate up the clutch pa k for first. The fiction material then found its way all around the trans.

The filter cannot be changed without removing the trans. The trans cannot be fully drained. There are ways to power flush it but you HAVE to get the TCM flashed to remove that “feature.”"

Once the extremely hot water from the well has given up most of its’ energy to a turbine to produce power, they had this lagoon to cool it before discharging.

politics,"He has put this inquiry together in two months. Republicans spent 5 years to get to a point where they proved Clinton had a seedy affair with an innocent intern. The leader of that investigation said yesterday he thinks Trump is in deep trouble here. 

Two months. He proved the sitting President used extortion (with US taxpayer dollars) to attempt extraction of a political gain from a foreign government. 

Keep that in mind. Two months. Yeah. He’s been pretty effective.

Assuming Intel is done, House Judiciary will get the report from this hearing and draft (assuming they’re not already drafted which is a silly assumption) articles of impeachment. They vote as committee and the the floor vote. 

President Trump could be impeached inside of three months from the complaint. That’s a Congressional land speed record. Why? Because it’s that openly corrupt."
carporn,That’s about S6000 sitting right there.
Justrolledintotheshop,"True. But the Syclone was only on me year Vice the Typoon’s three. Hard to believe there were only about 5,500 Typhoons and 1,800 Syclones."

At best, at best the President isn’t familiar with the Constitution. At worst, he is and doesn’t care to abide by it.  That the AG is in on the game? Disgusting. 

When this is over, we really need to think as a nation on how to keep the DoJ truly protected from becoming a toady to the King/President."

As the lighter gases dissolved out of the molten surface but were retained by the ever increasing gravity of the growing planet, an atmosphere formed. This atmosphere began to have a slowing effect on small bits hitting the planet. They were no longer contributing as much heat to the surface. There were also fewer available bits as the solar system was packing them into planets. The surface began to cool and form a crust, and eventually a mantle over the still molten center.

Zumwalts have been in the “tech demonstrator” role for years now. By all rights, they should be cruisers due to size and tonnage but the program had to be a DD for political reasons.

They are to surface ships what the SSN-21 class was to subs. Tech marvels whose main role was to lend technology to their cheaper descendants. The Virginia owes a lot to the Seawolf and now the SSGN programs. "

politics,"Then these tariffs aren’t going to help. The Federal Acquisition Regulations and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations requiring US steel for ships are decades old. If production doesn’t match demand now, enticing non defense buyers to source US steel isn’t going to make things better. At least not before the next administration undoes this. 

In short, it’s not a sensible reason for tariffs. It is, however, the one reason the executive can impose tariffs without the advice and consent of the legislature. Hmm. "
politics,"Yeah, the National Defense angle is BS. Ask any defense manufacturer, they’ve been required to use US steel and metals for decades. It’s a red herring argument, unless the person making it genuinely doesn’t know how this works because they’ve never actually interacted with National Defense.

I wonder which it is."

Much as the FBI doesn’t ask interviewees questions they don’t already know the answers to, you don’t send the head of state to make deals that haven’t already been agreed to.
