[Western Native Voice v. Stapleton](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/h_qBCM8KLQH5m2GBYIkoTBN?domain=youtube.com) challenged Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton on the Montana Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), which limits who can collect and convey a ballot belonging to another person. 

Staff Attorney at the Native American Rights Fund Natalie Landreth said [Friday's ruling](https://narf.org/nill/documents/20200925mt-ballot-order.pdf) means ""that this election, Indian people in Montana can get the help they so sorely need to have their ballots counted.""

The court ruled BIPA is unconstitutional, as it violates the constitutional rights to vote, to free speech and to due process of law.

BIPA supporters in the Legislature argue these restrictions would reduce the risk of voters giving their ballots to strangers who could change them or throw them away, according to The Associated Press.'

pics,Hi there! I hope you have a very pleasant and wonderful day. 😎
politics,Learn how to read the next time you try to start an argument that you can't finish. Your original question was clearly meant to bait me into having this elongated unnecessary argument upon which you have failed to convince me. Your responses indicate to me that you don't know anything about Montana politics and that you're wasting your time.
politics,"Apparently, you're not seeing the point I'm trying to make, so let me spell it out for you plainly and simply. The incident in Whitefish was supported by a lot of us, including myself. She stood up to that racist man because she understands what was going on at the time of the nationwide peaceful protests. Black Lives Matter has had several peaceful protests in Whitefish, Helena, Missoula, Billings, etc. This woman was peaceful in her protest and this man was clearly fired up for no reason. He was a bigoted racist asshole and that's not what Montanans are. That's not apart of our values or our creed. He showed the darker side of our political history without realizing it and he failed against her. 

What I'll say is this: you have no idea how Montana is in terms of our politics on the local and state level. We are a 'purple' state, wherein Democrats and Republicans have equal representation amongst the voters. While we have been right leaning in our voting history for the general elections, we have had a Democratic governor since the year 2005. We have also had support amongst the people for equal representation in public offices, whether they are forced to say Partisan, Republican, or Democrat. For you to bring up a white supremacist racial incident has nothing to do with our political landscape. While it may show off us in a bad light, you make no sense in terms of what you're trying to say.

Move on to something else. It will better for you and me to end this pointless arguing."
politics,"I do as well. I am actually fearing that if the cases keep on the rise, the Governor might close us down again. The threat has been there for awhile and I certainly don't want to be laid off again. These times are tough and I wish more Montanans would realize that this threat will not go away that easily. Mask up! It's the least you can do for yourself and others to beat this."
StarWars,This is very cute. Thank you for the smile!
politics,"I'm pretty sure you don't live here. To understand your question correctly, you're trolling me. I would suggest you either move on to somebody else or you look into local politics where you live. There's no such thing as 'three percenters', 'oath keepers', or 'Bundy derelicts' up here. I have never heard of such terms and I've lived up here ten plus years. Perhaps you need a better idea of what Montanans are before asking me silly questions."
politics,"I don't believe he has squandered it. There are a lot of people that have supported him since the beginning and there are many more that have stopped supporting him because of his response to the pandemic. Montanans can be stubborn in terms of politics and personally, I have seen more support in the last few days because of his unrelenting campaign for all of us to mask up. He has done a great job in my personal opinion and I think if he keeps this up, he will have a lot of support come November. Will he get the Senate seat? It's up in the air honestly. Will it be a close race? Yes. It absolutely will be."
politics,I don't think you understand Montana politics very well. Libertarians haven't split the Republican vote for years in our state and it probably won't ever happen. The likelihood of this even being considered is ludicrous because there really aren't a lot of libertarians up here. It has been significantly divided between Democrats and Republicans for years. This won't be  changing any time soon.

As for the general election? Montana will be a red state because it's a Trump 'safe' state. You wouldn't believe how many arguments I get into up here because I vote Blue. Luckily we are a purple state, so as much as it will be Trump's delegates, I ain't voting for that moron."

I have yet to leave my home around the state capitol and go anywhere else in Montana because I don't want to expose myself too much in light of all of it. Governor Bullock has asked the public to start wearing masks, yes; but if our cases keep going up, we may be shut down once again."

Our cases were significantly lower as a result of us shutting down around the end of March and only just reopening recently. While some people have been very upset that he did this, our death toll rate is evidence to the contrary. It is one of the lowest in the country because of this and I believe Bullock has a really big chance to take Steve Daines' seat if he gets enough votes. It will be a very, very close race indeed."

Well there ya have it. Two weeks worth of Montana politics! On a different note, a lot of activity has slowed down up here in the Treasure State due to the Governor Bullock's response to the coronavirus. I posted an article last week which explained he gave an order to close bars, restaurants, breweries, distilleries, casinos, etc. until March 23rd. Unfortunately, (and this might have been due to complaints from certain third parties), he extended this order to ALL of Montana as well as extending the original order until the 31st. There were quite a few of us driving to the next county just so we could have a beer!!! Anyway, we are all struggling up here and I am hoping this public order is not extended any longer than it needs to be. Montana will survive this. We all will.

Stay safe. Be well. Be kind to one another. Work hard when you can. And keep in touch. Happy Politics!"

I am unfortunately unable to report about this last week's politics news as I was informed this afternoon I am being laid off due to the coronavirus. As of the time of this writing, all bars, restaurants, casinos, etc. have been shut down from March 17th at 6 AM to March 23rd 8 AM. This is not only affecting us here in Lewis and Clark county, but Butte-Silver Bow, Gallatin, Missoula, and Yellowstone counties. I expect all the other counties in Montana to follow suit.

That's all for this week. Due to the filing deadline being this afternoon at noon for Montana, Steve Bullock announcing his run for the U.S. Senate puts him as a challenger to Steve Daines, our Republican Senator. This will cause some scrutiny among some Democrats as the few that have announced campaigns and been running the last few months will more than likely drop out to support Bullock, due to his popularity and influence. This is not necessarily a bad thing but I imagine there will be some mud slinging soon. I will report on what I can in the coming weeks.

Be well. Be kind. Work hard. Keep in touch. Happy Politics!

P.s. it was also my birthday IRL this last weekend and somebody asked if I was going to file. Perhaps I will another time when I have more time and money to be a Legislator. I actually haven't even considered it an option I guess. Bye for now!

EDIT: As of thirty minutes ago, Wilmot Collins has suspended his campaign via a video on Facebook to endorse Steve Bullock. As far as I know, there is only one other Democrat, John Mues, to be in the U.S. Senate race that hasn't dropped out yet."

Wowzers that was one of my longest posts for Montana Politics news in awhile! Thanks for reading! Have a great week! Be well. Be kind. Work hard. Keep in touch. Happy Politics!"
AskReddit,"As someone that is currently suffering from both anxiety and depression due to factors out of my control, I try to wake up knowing that somebody somewhere will need my smile and uplifting attitude at some point during the day. I may not be happy with mtself everyday, but at least I can make somebody laugh or try to. There's been a lot of loss around me and by having them see me smile or them to see me laugh, it makes all the difference in the world more than people realize."
politics,I've had that before. It ain't a bad drink choice honestly!
politics,"Congrats on getting new eyes! It's always exciting to get new frames. I've been wearing glasses/contacts for years, so I know how you feel."
politics,I also put the good quality fertilizer in the greenhouse before I filled it with the crops of Blueberries. It definitely is very satisfying to harvest!
politics,I have noticed Pumpkins are the way to go in the Fall. They are fantastic profit if you have enough of them. It's definitely worth the investment. That's why getting Ancient seeds is hard! I may have to do a bounty of Pumpkins for Year 5.
politics,"Maybe a little Prosciutto, a cracker, and mozzarella with some basil. Give that a try."
politics,"I had one Pinot from Costco a few years ago that was pretty nice. Usually most of the wines there, you can't go wrong with. I'd recommend looking into some Chardonnays. They're great on the palate when paired with certain foods."
politics,Thank you! I appreciate that!
politics,"Being from Montana, I love me some Cold Smoke from Kettlehouse Brewing in Missoula and Otter Water from Philipsburg Brewing in Philipsburg."
politics,Perhaps you should stay. I encourage you to! There are many conservative users on the subreddit. I even think some of us mods lean more conservatively than others.
politics,"The Outsider for me was just insane at the beginning. I've watched several Stephen King adaptations and this one feels really great and close to the source material. I have not read the novella though, so I'm not completely sure if that is accurate. As far as how it's going so far? The first two episodes were INSANE (you probably know what I am referencing without spoilers). I am really liking it!

I also forgot about Chernobyl. I rewatched it last week. It's such a great show! Just like The Night Of, I was encapsulated from the beginning and enjoyed every episode as it aired even after the fact. HBO is a great streaming service and I feel they're still going to do great things in the future for entertainment!

Definitely watch it! It's great!"
politics,Thank you for the positive comments. I feel too many of us are focusing on the negatives. We have to remember that we are all human and we can pull each other up no matter what happens. It's what we do.
politics,"'We love the things we love for what they are.'

politics,"I registered as an Absentee voter for Montana years ago. It's really nice! One of the best parts of living near the capitol is that if I don't want to mail it, I can deliver it myself to the Elections office! Convenience at its finest!"
politics,Don't remind me. My cake day IRL is in less than a month!
politics,"Just like Dory says:

'Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming.'"
politics,"In Montana, the Secretary of State website has a tab where you can type in your name and such to see if they received it! I'm sure they might have something similar for your state!"
politics,"I have the console version so the updates were a little slow on the uptake. I thought the Missing Bundle would be super hard to do but I finally got to level 35 in the Skull Cavern and it was FULL of dinos as a Boss room, so that was nice. Got three eggs out of it so I completed the bundle with the Mayonnaise. Catching Sturgeon for the Caviar was super hard too for some reason. Why should a Level 10 Fisher have a hard time catching Sturgeon? Lol!"
politics,"Yes! I am loving it so far. HBO is really cranking out some great shows lately. Ever since the disappointment of GOT, I told myself I'd give HBO another chance. Euphoria, The Outsider, Watchmen??? McMillion$? I love it!"
politics,You da real MVP.
politics,I'll even throw in Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1 and 2. That's where I first heard Rage Against the Machine and a couple others! Some of the older games had some great music! Even the first Tony Hawks Underground with KISS was amazing!
politics,"Honestly for this place? I got a drip coffee and a the sandwich for $9.70. We don't have sales tax up here, so I saved a couple bucks! ;) They have all sorts of different items here too! Breakfast burritos, hot sandwiches, some salads...it's a neat place!"
politics,Listening to Jurassic 5 while playing video games is my favorite past time.
politics,Welcome! Glad to have you here. I hope things go well for you!
politics,I always liked the Cold Buster. I could use one right now. I guess it's a Hot Toddy for me!
politics,"I purchased the Xbox Special Edition and it's fantastic. Obviously you're not going to get a perfect modded game, but vanilla Skyrim takes me back to when I first played it in November of 2011. Those were the days."
politics,Echoes by Pink Floyd while high was both the best and worst thing I've ever done to myself.
politics,I just recently was able to get my iTunes back and running. What kind of music are you into? Maybe we can toss around some suggestions for each other!
politics,Excellent! I hope things work out for you. Best wishes for your contributions to the Texas Democratic Party!
politics,I just had a Steak Queso sandwich from a local coffee shop with a coffee and honey. It really hit the spot. Now I'm going to go practice some darts!
politics,"Call J.G Wentworth!!! Wait...sorry. I don't want to get that stuck in your head. My former roommate would kill me.

I'm excited for you. My best suggestion? Maybe start volunteering at a local candidates office near you. Election season will need a lot of people to help others get out the vote. It's a start!"
politics,Get on it friend! You got this!
politics,Skyrim is one of my favorite games. I recently played for a few days just on mods that I haven't played before and it was a great time!
politics,"Do you want ants?!

Because THAT'S you get ants."
politics,"Find a local candidate where you live and go to their office. Volunteering is a great way to get started into politics! With election season coming up in a few months, I'm sure there are many ways you can help them out!"
politics,Sounds like a nightmare for me. I only recently got my first FULL three star Pokemon too. It takes so long to get those!
politics,Ouch. That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear that. Keep us posted on any updates for Florida politics! I'm sure there's a lot of interesting local stories you can find for us! Best of luck to your teaching.
politics,You should check out my weekly contributions about Montana politics in the Weekly State threads here on the subreddit! (We obviously had a lot going on this week so it didn't happen this week!) I started contributing to those a couple years ago because most people didn't know much about anything for Montana politics until I started posting there. It's fun! Just don't steal my thunder now!
politics,Ah yes. Our great Treasure State does boast some great fishing spots! I need to dust off my pole and go this summer. A buddy of mine always asks me to go but I've been busy lately. The crazy thing is that we don't really have to drive too far to find a good spot! It's insane!
politics,Excellent! Good for you! It sounds like they've gained a passionate worker willing to do the job right. I hope you do great things for them!
politics,Absolutely. I hope you enjoy your 'sensory overload'. Just don't turn on 'The Wall' while playing it!
politics,That's why I don't understand why some Montanans don't want it legalized. It would boost the local economies of the bigger cities because people would TRAVEL from the rural areas to go to dispensaries. It's a huge opportunity for many small businesses here!
politics,"I haven't played Sea of Thieves. I recall recently that there was a DLC out for it, but I don't really see myself playing that. I'll play Assassin's Creed IV for that...or Pirate's Creed I should say. FULL SAIL!"
politics,"I absolutely agree. The founding fathers based a lot of their morals and ideas for the Constitution based on their understandings of the Bible. Not everything, but quite a lot! It would of course be unfair to downplay it. It's been a very long time since I've read either of those sections, so I myself don't know the specifics of what students would really gain from reading it. 

I was in AP/Honors courses all throughout high school. To say history is not being taught as much as it should be to today's kiddos is very disheartening to hear. I really should've taken more Montana history courses. There's so much to learn about it and it's fascinating stuff! Are there a lot of students that become interested in Florida history or Florida politics?"
politics,"Like I mentioned above, I've been jamming in Stardew Valley recently. My greenhouse is FULL of Blueberries and right now I'm trying to figure out for all the seasons which crops I would make the most money out of. Obviously the Starfruit is the way to go, but they're so expensive! I've set aside land specifically for those and I'm working on getting more Ancient Fruit seeds. I just unlocked the Movie Theatre and am also working on getting every cut scene for the characters. Getting their heart levels to maximum is taking forever!"
politics,I caught a shiny Piplup the other morning in Pokemon Go! It was unexpectedly awesome. I don't usually come across shiny Pokemon a lot up here!
politics,Are you suggesting they did it on purpose?
politics,"That's interesting. Question for you! Would reading the Federalist Papers or something similar be something required for an English AP/Honors course? I don't know if it would necessarily work in the regular classroom as some of that reading can be pretty dry. Not all of it, but you know what I mean! Scientific papers are still some of the hardest things I struggle to read through and I graduated college in 13'!

As for the Bible stuff, I can understand where they are going with it. If I was in your position, being an Atheist, itwould be a hard thing for me to teach at all. I'm willing to hear the reasons out though if you'd like to discuss it more."
politics,We will not be 'screwed' if we encourage each and every single person we know and don't know to vote in November. The power of a vote does matter.
politics,I miss Jamba Juice. Now I want a smoothie! Dammit!
politics,We Montanans love our guns. That doesn't stop us from being Democrats in the rural areas!
politics,Baron Corbin in the XFL would be making the 'King in the Ring' look like a badass promo.
politics,Mario Party 3 is the best!!!
politics,That sounds really relaxing. You deserve a vacation! Have fun with it!
politics,Yup.
politics,I haven't been to the movies in a fair minute. I have just been too busy to even think about seeing films in the theatre right now. I did rewatch the Shining the other night though. :)
politics,"We are drafting 'bills' for voters to [vote](https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/dueling-recreational-marijuana-initiatives-gear-up-for-montana-ballot/article_36de7425-0c5a-5ca2-ab42-0344bf31352c.html)
on legalisation of Marijuana up here too!"
politics,Voting can do that! It's an American institution. It's my only hope that everyone will get the vote out up here in the Treasure State too!
politics,That sounds cool honestly.
politics,...error...DELEte. DELE..[redacted] [redacted]>=[I'm still alive]...DeLEte.
politics,Have fun! Margot Robbie is an excellent actress and I think she will steal the show.
politics,I have not played Rust! Is it any good? I looked at some pictures and I'm getting the 7 Days to Die vibes from it!
politics,"I honestly am not sure how I feel about it yet. It looks interesting enough but with how much the promotion failed in its last attempt to become mainstream, I'm skeptical."
PublicFreakout,One of the best!
aww,"The Many Adventures of Maple Stirrup and Mittens: When the Cold Strikes Again!

nosleep,I'm very sad to hear that the lady with many eyes won't help you anymore after this. I am so very thankful she is kind in case I am ever to find her near the campground.
SquaredCircle,I love Hangman Adam Page! Get this man another beer!
gaming,Cool! I'm glad to see you have a neat setup in such a small space. Be safe out there!
politics,"Greg Gianforte DID assault reporter Ben Jacobs for asking him about health care just prior to the Montana Special Election in 2017. It was uncalled for and disgusting, but the fact of the matter was that most Montanans had already sent in their absentee ballots. Greg Gianforte didn't win by a landslide though! Missoula and Gallatin counties (where he is mainly based) voted BLUE and for good reason. The Montana GOP has always stood behind this man but I haven't.

'Republican leaders in the Montana House of Representatives on Monday asked Billings Republican state Rep. Rodney Garcia to resign.

“We believe it is clear that you can no longer effectively discharge the duties of the office you hold,"" according to the letter signed by Speaker of the House Greg Hertz; E. Wylie Galt, the speaker pro tem; and House Majority Leader Brad Tschida, all Republicans. “Therefore, it is our request that you submit your resignation with immediate effect.""

Garcia rejected the call to resign Monday, saying that the ""only way I would give my resignation is if God asked me to.""'

You have to remember though, not all of us Montanans are as crazy as this guy is."

politics,We are actively working on this ongoing issue. It is an almost daily discussion between us moderators and I assure you these responses that we have received go into the considerations of getting rid of Breitbart.

These are discussions with the users on how to improve the subreddit and the experience they have on Reddit. I don't agree with your assessment that 'most people' hate us.

Breitbart comes up a lot in these discussions internally and there are a lot of us that want to get rid of it.

Up here in Montana, the troopers can get a bit apprehensive at times when they're dealing with a heavy situation if it involves drugs or alcohol; as far as I know, most of the ones I've interacted with have been very professional and I don't think they'd EVER do something like this to someone. The cop you were interacting with was over the line on how he was proceeding and I hope you know that not every cop is this way. They're to protect and serve the state in which you reside after all. That being said, I hope you can realize that ultimately the cop was just trying to do his job...honestly, I do not agree with how he did it because he should have done it in a much better way. Asking questions about your PTSD was none of his business and him putting the phone away was a HUGE red flag. Remember that you can film any interaction with the police, be it trooper, sheriff, or city.

I'm sorry you had to go through that. Be safe out there."

politics,"Good afternoon from the great Treasure State of Montana! Here's what happened this last week for politics news!

There's really only one important story to be shared this week.

[Rep. Gianforte voting no on impeachment articles; calls process a “sham”](https://www.kpax.com/news/montana-news/rep-gianforte-voting-no-on-impeachment-articles-calls-process-a-sham)

I have said this before and I'll say it again. Representative Gianforte does not represent ALL of Montanans' points of view about the articles of impeachment. He may be our lone representative in the House but he is not supported across the state by any means.

That is all.

Be well. Be kind. Work hard. Keep in touch. Happy Politics!"

politics,"Per the article on how this relates to the great Treasure State of Montana:

""...​Establish MMIP (Missing and Murdered Indigenous People) coordinators: The Department of Justice is investing an initial $1.5 million to hire 11 MMIP coordinators in 11 Western states. They will work closely with federal, tribal, state and local agencies to develop common protocols and procedure for responding to reports of missing or murdered Indigenous people. Barr told the Tribal Council that Montana’s coordinator, Ernie Weyand, has already been hired.

...

Both tribal policy analyst Jami Pluff and Kurt Alme, U.S. Attorney for Montana, said the event also gave Barr a chance for them to hear the tribes’ concerns about the Keystone XL Pipeline, which has enjoyed strong support from the Trump administration — and drawn the ire of missing-persons activists. 

...

The pipeline would run through eastern Montana and is currently set to begin construction sometime next year. Opponents fear that pipeline construction, and the worker housing developments known as “man camps,” could drive an increase in violent crime against Native American women. 

Pluff said the pipeline came up during their discussion, “and we were actually surprised at the response they have already.” She said Alme and Montana Attorney General Tim Fox were committed to meeting with tribal communities along the pipeline route and preparing for the construction phase. “They said that was definitely something that we wanted to address,” said Pluff, “because our tribe is definitely not in support of the pipeline, and we made that clear, but at least we are addressing the issue that the man camps could bring.” 

Pluff said the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes are relatively well-equipped to handle missing-persons cases, because unlike on other Montana reservations, CSKT law enforcement and courts share jurisdiction with their state and local counterparts. “We work so close with other jurisdictions. We’re lucky, but statewide it’s really an issue.” 

...

The tribes also took Barr to an overlook near the National Bison Range and discussed their long-held goal of placing it in federal trust ownership for the tribes. After meeting with the tribal leadership, Barr continued on to Kalispell and discussed methamphetamine-related problems with Republicans Daines and Montana Attorney General Tim Fox, along with several Northwest Montana law enforcement officials.

In discussing meth in Montana, Barr stressed the need for the Mexican government to crack down on drug cartels to address the problem."""

LifeProTips,"We got our bun bun in 2001 for Christmas and we had just barely finished third grade. Her name was Arewen (yes, we are super into LOTR) and she was an all black Havana breed. Over the years, she was the sweetest rabbit you could imagine. She was raised in a good home, got all the raisins she wanted for a treat, and left lovely Cocoa Puffs on the living room floor when it was time for her to go back in her cage. She would ring her little bell every day when we came in the garage to visit her! She loved her zoomies and especially around the Christmas tree. I loved that rabbit and my family did everything we could to give her the best life possible.

Unfortunately, we had to put her down due to her losing the ability to hop in 2014. Thirteen years! She was an old lady! Rest easy on the rainbow bridge Arewen."

Currently, I don't even see that as happening because there are only a few areas that identify as 'Democrat' in the state, mainly the Missoula area. If they built it on the Eastern side of the state they may run into some problems there as most of the rest of Montana is strict red as can be. Amazon is certainly capable of building a warehouse out here but I don't necessarily think they will right now. I guess time will tell!"
