modnews,"We're largely in agreement here. The best use case for this is likely event oriented posts like gameday threads, watch parties, etc. I do think it's possible however to see people using this for substantive conversations in the future as well. Substantive discussion, but of a different type. Real time discussion is very good for things like getting help solving a problem or coordinating for things like r/place. So ya I think you're broadly correct, but I also expect to be surprised by novel applications of this view."

redesign,"Hey, this is very cool! I designed the chat stuff, and appreciate when people take the time to think through new concepts, and give specific feedback. Thanks for doing this.

I've also explored variations of this design pattern, and I could see a world one day where it was an option. I'd probably want it to be collapsible too since some people don't want to chat, appreciate the extra space on their screen, or would like some privacy when they're in an environment where people might look over their shoulder and see their chats.

I'll keep this in mind when we revisit some of these patterns in the future. Let me know if you have other feedback or ideas too, and thanks again! :)"

Forget all the mod tools we have?

##An overview of all the mod tools
It‚Äôs hard to keep track of all the mod tools that we have for chat, so we‚Äôre going to make your lives easier by putting them all here as easy reference.

**Chat Moderation Permissions**: There are 2 mod permissions (chat config, chat moderator), which allow mods to create, edit, and delete rooms or take chat moderation actions. Many communities like to give chat moderator permissions to a different group of people so that they can have chat moderators who don‚Äôt have the power to control anything else on the subreddit. This is a model that works really well for many communities. Simply go to the Access Controls section where you add or edit moderator permissions in order to access these two new permissions.

**Chat Moderation Actions**: Chat moderators can take certain actions in a chat room: kick a user, ban a user from chat or from a subreddit, and delete certain messages or all messages from a user.

**Keyword Filter List**: Chat config moderators can input keywords that they want to automatically delete from their chat rooms.

**Customizing the Message Rate Limit**: Chat moderators may want to dictate the pace of conversation in their chat rooms. Moderators can do this by controlling the number of messages a user can send every 10 seconds. This number is configurable.

**Locking Rooms**: Chat moderators can lock rooms so that no one can speak in them.

**Disallow Links**: Chat config mods are now able to disallow all links from being sent in their chat rooms. In order to enable this mods can go to the ‚ÄúManage Rooms‚Äù screen, click on the settings icon, and select the setting to disallow links.

**Domain allow/block list**: Chat config mods can now control which domains are accepted in their chat rooms. Mods can either allow a certain list of domains or explicitly disallow a certain list of domains to be sent in their chat rooms. In order to enable this mods can go to ‚ÄúManage Rooms‚Äù screen, click on the settings icon, and click the button to allow/disallow domains.

**Regex Filters**: Chat config mods can now input regex in order to automatically block specific messages from their rooms. Many communities have written regex for AutoMod to ban messages from their rooms. In order to add regex rules, mods can go to ‚ÄúManage Rooms,‚Äù click on the settings icon, and click to add regex rules.

*For now, regex filters are limited to 500 characters and mods can only add 10 regular expressions. As we scale up we will be able to support more, but we think this will go a long ways, especially with the keyword filter in tandem.*

**@all Mention**: Moderators are able to @mention an entire room to give important updates. @mentioning a user will badge the room and will send a push notification to users who are in the rooms and are using the mobile apps (and haven‚Äôt muted the rooms)."
community_chat,Didn‚Äôt take any offense or feel like you were putting me down - just a reminder to send over your other feedback whenever you have time ;)
modnews,"Yes, if a message is removed in a chat room, there is no indication to anyone in the room that a message is or was there. The message is however retained for a period of time on the backend so that admins can review messages that were reported and subsequently deleted."
community_chat,"Heya, I design all the chat stuff. I have a bunch of ideas for improving the ui, but if you have specific design suggestions, I‚Äôd love to hear them. Please send them over :)"
community_chat,It‚Äôs a bug that we‚Äôre working on. It happens when you join a room via the sidebar on redesign. It should fix itself if you refresh the page. Sorry bout that :/
modnews,"Messages sent to a chat room which contain words or domains that are banned in that room will fail to send, and the person attempting to send them will be notified that the message did not send. When a mod in a room removes a message that someone sent, the person is not notified. But the history of the chat is visibly the same for all people."
modnews,"We're working on a fix for this and should have it released soon. It affects some people on iOS only, and it's very frustrating. Crashing bugs are the worst, sorry about that :/"
modnews,"I had not thought about this, or had forgotten about it haha. I think it's a really good idea, and I'll discuss with u/jleeky if/when we can do it. Thanks!"
modnews,"You're very welcome, and I wrote a big wall of text so I'm sure that bullet point was easy to overlook haha. I'm not sure on the timeline, but I think/hope it will be before the end of the year."
modnews,"I think this is an interesting idea that I've also thought about, but I'm hesitant as well. Subscribers-only I think would be easy to circumvent, and also might feel invasive. Right now no one knows what subs you subscribe to, but a system like that would reveal that info. 

Karma thresholds are interesting too, and we may end up doing it. I personally feel like it might feel unfair to a lot of people who typically lurk but might want to chat. For instance, I have a 7 year old personal account with a grand total of 64 karma. It would be really discouraging for me at least, and I imagine there are a lot of people who use Reddit in a similar way. That said, the tradeoff might be worth it in some cases, and we need to think about it more.

If you have other ideas, please keep em coming :)"
modnews,"I wrote this above, but will quote here as well. Do you think settings like this will help?

>**Control over who can invite you to chat**: This is a highly requested feature that will let you specify who can send you direct chat invites. It should be especially helpful for mods who want to be able to prevent people from chatting them but not block those people entirely. You‚Äôll be able to choose options like ‚ÄúAllow anyone to chat me,‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly allow accounts older than 30 days to chat me,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let anyone chat me, I‚Äôll invite others if I want to chat.‚Äù

&#x200B;"
modnews,Chat rooms are opt in and are created by mods of the sub. No rooms exist by default. Let me know if I‚Äôm misunderstanding what you‚Äôre saying though
modnews,"Similar to how bots work on the rest of Reddit, the chat bot api should be available to anyone. What it can do in each chat room will be dependent on what permissions it has in each sub."
modnews,"There is a team dedicated to normal mod tools, and the stuff I‚Äôve seen them working on looks really cool. I‚Äôm not super close to their roadmap, and can‚Äôt speak to it with great clarity. But feel free to let me know here or in direct chat if you have other ideas for mod tool improvements that I can pass along to them."
modhelp,This is an excellent follow up and it sounds like we should look into it more closely. I‚Äôll get in touch in a direct chat with you shortly to see what we can do to further investigate and repro the problem. Thank you so much for reporting :)
modhelp,"Heya, sorry this is happening for you. If you set a subreddit chat room to private, it should be invisible to anyone you didn‚Äôt invite, and invite-only forever. This means that if you kick them from the chat room for any period of time, they should only ever be able to rejoin if they were invited again by someone in the room. 

Can you verify that you have the room set to private? If it is private, is it possible that someone else with access to the room is inviting the person you kicked back into the room. If the room is private and no one is inviting the kicked person back, this sounds like a high priority bug for us, and I‚Äôd love to follow up with you privately to hear more details. Feel free to send me a direct chat anytime, and I‚Äôll respond as quick as I can."
community_chat,"Heya, as others have said, currently reports only go to admins. But we‚Äôre starting work shortly on a chat mod queue feature. Reported messages will flow to a room for mods only, and mods will be able to take action on the reported messages or users who sent the reported messages. If you have thoughts on how this system should work, please let us know :)"
community_chat,"All subreddits can make rooms now so feel free to start onion chat any time. 

I‚Äôd be happy to be a mod of r/OnionLovers, but you should know that, while I personally love onions, my political stance is pretty neutral on the topic. I know people who love onions and people who hate them, it‚Äôs just a matter of taste"
community_chat,"We‚Äôre starting work on a reports room this week which should help. Send me a direct chat if you wanna see some designs - would love to hear your feedback. We‚Äôre also getting close to basic regex support for messages. And we‚Äôre getting close to blacklist/whitelist for link domains. Hopefully all of these things will help out with spammy content, but I‚Äôd love to hear other ideas if you have them :)"
DnD,Thought it might be helpful to link to the chat room since they can be hard to find: [https://s.reddit.com/channel/943389\_7bbf0a2155e76ef10820d4e4c3d231bc3fed709f](https://s.reddit.com/channel/943389_7bbf0a2155e76ef10820d4e4c3d231bc3fed709f)
community_chat,"Hi, sorry you were experiencing that bug. We've fixed it now, and you should be able to create rooms. Thanks for reporting! :)"
SubChats,"Hmm I‚Äôm not sure tbh. I think it‚Äôs valuable to have  somewhere obvious for requests, but a megathread or something might work fine and make things feel less cluttered "
SubChats,I think it's valuable for people to be able to come and voice what types of rooms they're interested in seeing. Good place for mods of subs to come and see what their subscribers want. And also there have been a few subs created specifically because people saw demand and no rooms existed for the topic from the subs you would think would have created them. But I can also see how it's sort of hard for people coming to see just rooms that exist. Would be nice if it was easier to filter stuff on reddit by flair :/
community_chat,"We plan to make it easier to discover rooms in the future. It‚Äôs difficult now, I agree. Also if you‚Äôre using redesign (or new.reddit.com), you can go to any sub‚Äôs main page and look at the bottom of their sidebar to see any public rooms they have (if they have them)"
community_chat,"We currently have some basics in place: keyword filtering and rate limiting. We want to get to a place where we basically have a chat automod with regex etc, and we're working on it. But we need to see how far we can go while maintaining performance. Check out my response above to u/BuckRowdy for a little more info, and let me know if there are other questions you have or ways I could help you feel comfortable using chat in r/dnd. I think that would be an amazing community for chat (a bunch of people have asked for it over in r/SubChats), and I bet there may be a good number of people in the community that you could get to help mod chat only while they're chatting."
community_chat,"Thank you for the follow up, and you definitely didn't come across as angry or anything :)

I have a couple of ideas that could possibly help in the short term. The first is just recruiting more mods for chat. You can now give mods chat only permission - meaning they can't moderate anything else on your sub except chat. One thing a lot of people do is find active chatters in their rooms and ask them if they wouldn't mind moderating as they chat. Just a thought anyway.

Another thought for the short term is asking people to mention your username or send you a direct message when they report something. I know it's not ideal, but at least you'll get a push notification if someone mentions you, and you may be able to jump in and find the questionable content.

Longer term, we'll get those scrolling bugs fixed, and we're working on some new moderation tools that should help. Here are some things coming up: 

* bot api will release soon which will let people make all sorts of bots with mod or not mod permissions
* disabling links completely or setting a black/white list of domains
* regex in keyword filters - we're working on this, but still need to understand how close to automod functionality we can get while maintaining performance

Does any of this help you feel better at least directionally about where chat is headed? Let me know if you have other thoughts, or I can provide better clarity. And thanks again for your feedback - it's really helpful!"
community_chat,"Hi there. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that chat is painful to moderate adequately and easily. We‚Äôre working on scrolling bugs now especially on web (it‚Äôs better on iOS and android app atm but still needs improvements), and we‚Äôre actively developing more powerful mod tools. 

Beyond fixing scrolling problems and finding a way to alert mods of reported messages in chat, are there other tools that you think would help? We really want to make the right tools for mods on reddit in chat, and we need all the input from you we can get. 

I know it won‚Äôt fix all of the problems you‚Äôre experiencing, but I‚Äôm curious if you‚Äôve considered or have added any mods to specifically focus on chat moderation. We‚Äôve found that it helps to have a few mods with chat only focus. Again, we know we‚Äôre early on in this process and definitely need to improve our tools - just asking about how you‚Äôve approached stuff so far. Please let us know what else we can do to help."

modnews,"There's a hacky work around that you can use to accomplish today, and we'll hopefully make it make more sense in the future. Basically if you ban the person from your sub and then unban them, it will reset thei kick or chat ban. Hopefully that makes sense anyway"
modnews,"If you'd rather use classic Reddit over redesign to manage rooms, you can visit [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com) rather than opt in and then opt out of redesign. We also plan to bring the room management ui to classic Reddit, but opted to build on redesign first because it's significantly faster and easier to work with its codebase."
modnews,"If you‚Äôd like them to be able to create and edit rooms, they need the chat config permission. If you want them to be able to moderate chat, they need the chat operator permission. If you‚Äôd like them to be able to do both, you can give them both permissions :)"

modnews,Yes you can definitely delete a room after it's created. You can also lock a room which will prevent anyone except mods from being able to send messages in the room while it's locked. Locking sounds like it might be a good option for you :)
modnews,You can delete rooms yes. In this case though I‚Äôd probably suggest locking the room while you‚Äôre away. This will prevent anyone except mods from being able to send messages while the room is locked :)
modnews,"Not the answer I was looking for, but a good one nonetheless "
modnews,Must be!
modnews,Guess what
community_chat,Thank you for the gif that‚Äôs super helpful! I‚Äôve reported this to our iOS folks and they‚Äôre investigating now. In the meantime I invited you back to the room you were trying to join again - hopefully that helps for the short term 
community_chat,"I can see your point when you have only notifications from one chat, but I‚Äôm not sure it would make sense to do what you‚Äôre asking for as many people have notifications from multiple chats at the same time. If you had notifications from two different chats, we‚Äôd have to decide which one to drop you on. My preferred improvement to the existing system is to remember the last chat you were in, and drop you on that one when you open chat"
community_chat,"Can you check and see if this invite is showing up in your Rooms tab or your Directs tab? If it‚Äôs showing up in Directs, it‚Äôs a bug where a room you‚Äôve already joined also somehow ends up coming through as a Direct invite. We‚Äôre working on it, and I know it‚Äôs confusing :/"
community_chat,"Ya totally, and ideally many people will have a lot of joined rooms in the future. So I very much agree we should fix this bug :)"

blog,"This is already possible. You can start a direct chat with anyone you aren‚Äôt blocking or blocked by. And your chat contacts list should include any friends, people you follow, or people you‚Äôve recently PMed with :)"
blog,"People tend to use chat when they want to collaborate in a more real time manner or for off topic discussion that might not be appropriate for a sub with (perfectly valid and reasonable) strict rules. Good examples include r/place, casual conversations, and mod discussion. There are lots of scenarios where people find the real time nature of chat makes more sense than a threaded forums style form of communication. Chat supplements forums, and isn‚Äôt meant to replace them in any way. All that said, chat is optional, and people who don‚Äôt want to chat don‚Äôt have to chat :)"

community_chat,"I agree, there's a bug showing up in the popped out view that we shouldn't show. It's on our list, but lower priority than some other bugs :)"
community_chat,We're working on this right now :)
community_chat,"Heya, chat rooms are opt in and will always be opt in. We recognize that chat won‚Äôt make sense for some subs. And that‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt need to to take any further action to not have chat rooms - you have 0 by default. If you have other feedback or ideas that you think would be helpful for subs that do want to use chat, please let us know - it super helpful! :)"
community_chat,"Hi, there was a problem earlier where some of the subs we thought we whitelisted didn't get whitelisted. We think it's fixed now. Could you check again and let us know if you can create rooms now? Sorry bout that :/"
community_chat,"Hi, there was a problem earlier where some of the subs we thought we whitelisted didn't get whitelisted. We think it's fixed now. Could you check again and let us know if you can create rooms now? Sorry bout that :/"
community_chat,Thanks for the screenshots that‚Äôs very helpful! I‚Äôll ask our team to make sure that the subs that you‚Äôre asking about are indeed whitelisted. May take a bit as people are still making their way in to work ;)
community_chat,"No problem, and thanks for verifying the permissions for me :)

Can you also verify that you‚Äôre looking for the manage chat rooms button under Mod Tools on redesign from the main page of your sub (not a post details page, etc)?"
community_chat,"Heya, sorry to hear that the button isn't showing up. Can you verify for me that you have the Chat Config mod permission on the subs that're you're trying to create rooms with?"
community_chat,"Hey, did you get the same message more than once for a single sub? If so I apologize. That shouldn‚Äôt have been the case. And ya sorry about having the wording asking for you to reply to the modmail - that was a silly oversite on our part and we‚Äôll make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again :/"
modnews,We‚Äôre working on a bot api which will open the door I think for all kinds of interesting command based ui for moderation. Hopefully we can get a long way toward what you‚Äôre looking for with something like that :)
modnews,We‚Äôre working on regex support and then I think you‚Äôd get most of automod. Would love to hear other suggestions as well though of course :)
modnews,"Chat rooms are opt in on a sub by sub basis. We recognize that for some subs, chat rooms just won't make sense. And that's ok. If you don't want to use chat rooms, you don't need to take any action. By default you have 0 rooms. 

All that said, if you have feedback or ideas for chat rooms that you think would be beneficial for subs that do want to use them, please let us know :)"
Dcrtrader,"Heya, I'm personally a fan of an open API for chat that would let 3rd party apps integrate Reddit chat and do other interesting things like you suggest. I think a lot of people internally feel the same way. I'd be interested in seeing how those bridges that you guys are using work, even if just from a normal user's perspective. All that said, I don't know if/when a full API will happen (it's not only my decision), just to be transparent with you.

I also agree that direct integration with Reddit is advantageous because it creates a frictionless experience for all of the people already using Reddit every day. I think that cohesiveness is valuable to growing communities as they find and build their culture. And I also think Reddit is a very strong distribution channel. By that I mean people discover niche communities because they have a presence on Reddit. You see, as you say, positive growth loops created between crypto communities on Reddit due to interest overlap and ease of discovery on Reddit. 

Anyway I think I'm rambling now. I need to drink some coffee. Thanks for pointing out matrix to me - I'd heard of it, but not looked into it too much before. Will give it another look."
community_chat,We‚Äôre almost done with a ‚Äúdelete all messages from this user‚Äù feature now which will hopefully help out a lot here :)
community_chat,"We've had an ""archive"" feature on our list for a very long time, but it's just a matter of prioritizing it. JaysRooted points out a pretty weird but working work around until we get there"
community_chat,We're working on a mute room feature now that will let you do exactly what you're describing here :)
community_chat,"Heya! I hear you. Chat rooms is an opt in feature. You don't and won't have any rooms unless you create them. We know that a good number of subs won't want to use chat for various reasons including yours. You don't need to take any further action to be sure you won't have any chat rooms. That said, if you have feature ideas, feedback, or other thoughts about chat rooms that you think would help subs that do want to use them, please feel free to let us know - it's super helpful :)

You're freaking awesome too!"
community_chat,We‚Äôre working on that as we speak :)
exmormon,I‚Äôm trying to prevent my cat from eating my Whopper
exmormon,Yo
exmormon,Agreed
community_chat,"If you go to the sidebar if your sub and then look at your mod permissions, it should list all of the permissions you have - Access, Config, Posts, etc. one of the permissions there should be Chat Config. If you don‚Äôt see that or don‚Äôt have Full Permissions, you may not have it. Hopefully that makes sense anyway :/"
exmormon,"There is currently a bug affecting everyone when you open chat from the list in the sub. It loads infinitely. reddit.com/chat should work though. We‚Äôre working on a fix, sorry :/"
exmormon,"There is currently a bug affecting everyone when you open chat from the list in the sub. reddit.com/chat should work though. We‚Äôre working on a fix, sorry :/"
community_chat,"This is a bug for everyone right now, not just new rooms. We‚Äôre working to resolve it sorry :/"
community_chat,"Hi, can you verify for me that you have the Chat Config mod permission? We just added it last week, and it‚Äôs necessary if you want to be able to create a room. 

Sorry, I know it‚Äôs confusing that it looks like you have the ability to create a room even if you don‚Äôt have the correct permission - we‚Äôre working on that bug now."

Sorry, I know it‚Äôs confusing that it looks like you have the ability to create a room even if you don‚Äôt have the correct permission - we‚Äôre working on that bug now."
community_chat,"That's a fair point. You'll be able to create and find rooms in both the Android and iOS official apps soon. Unfortunately, the approval process for the App Store and the Play Store make our release cycles on mobile longer than web.

For now, the only time you must use web is to set up your rooms initially. After you do that you can use the rooms on mobile and not mess with web. Sorry it's taking a while for mobile to get to feature parity - I wish we could make it happen faster too :/"
community_chat,"You can create private or public chat rooms. Private chat rooms are invisible to anyone who has not been invited. So ya you could, and many mods do, create a private room for your mod team only. Hope that helps, but let me know if you need more clarity :)"
community_chat,"Thanks for the genuine feedback. Honestly I agree with much of what you're saying. For what it's worth, we have been specifically and intentionally working closely with a number of sports subs, and we agree that sports, given their event based nature, are very good use cases for chat rooms. 

The NBA finals chats rooms for instance were incredibly fun to be in (r/warriors alone had 17k members in their game day chats). Formula1 continues to be really fun on race days. I say this as someone who doesn't even follow those sports closely. 

So ya, we definitely want to keep encouraging sports sub to use chat, but also recognize we have a ways to go still to help everyone feel comfortable. Our main focus recently, and probably for the next month, has been on improving moderation tools because larger subs (sports subs included) worry about the burden of moderating chat without automated tools. We're very focused on tools like auto deletion of blacklisted words and a bot api, but we're also trying to fix especially annoying bugs in tandem. Anyway, sorry of the wall of text. Just wanted to let you know I hear what you're saying, and we're working on it."
community_chat,"I hear you. Part of the point of beta is to let people point out oversights and bugs, and I understand that some people have more of an appetite for that sort of thing than others. Hopefully we can get to a better place rather quickly, and you'll feel better about testing again.

Are there other bugs you can report? I haven't heard anyone else report the problems you experienced with Lock or Delete. We're working on making private rooms visible in the rooms list to mods and members of those rooms now. We prioritized making sure they were not visible to people who shouldn't have access first. "
community_chat,"Hmm, are other mods on your sub still having issues as well? Also, can you screenshot or video record what happens now when you try to lock the room (sorry I know that's a lot to ask). Thanks for reporting, I'll see if our web folks can reproduce the bugs you see"
Dcrtrader,"We‚Äôre working on making the normal url function like the share url, but it‚Äôs going to take some time. Also at some point 100% of people will have access to the feature and be able to join from either link. For the short term though, I‚Äôd encourage you to use the special share link whenever possible - it just works better."
Dcrtrader,"This will be a more effective link: [https://s.reddit.com/channel/303826\_894ad897a0da04186c624254bc3606b10662dcda](https://s.reddit.com/channel/303826_894ad897a0da04186c624254bc3606b10662dcda)

You can get it by using the gear in the top right and ""copy link."" The reason it's better is that people who don't have chat rooms enabled (99&#37; of people right now) will have it enabled after clicking the link. Whereas the normal link (for now) will not enable them, and those people will land on a dead page or be redirected. Just heads up ;)"
community_chat,"We'll be adding two new permissions to mods very soon that will allow you to do exactly what you're asking for. One will be Chat Room Management (create, edit, delete rooms), and the other will be Chat Moderation (kick, ban, etc from chat). Here's a post about it, and we'll probably also post in r/modnews about it when we release: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/8qnc50/adding\_new\_moderator\_permissions\_for\_chat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/8qnc50/adding_new_moderator_permissions_for_chat/)"
arrow,"Heya, glad to see you trying out chat rooms! Let us know if you have feedback or questions. 

Also, I would suggest updating your link in this post to use the share link which you can find if you go to the gear icon in the top right of the chat and click copy link. This is a special type of link that will not only direct people to the chat, but it will turn the chat rooms feature on for people if they don't already have it (99&#37; of people don't have access to the feature so far). Here's the link I'd suggest using: [https://s.reddit.com/channel/865666\_f83fa187969ef9ade0e3eabe645bcfd350b04855](https://s.reddit.com/channel/865666_f83fa187969ef9ade0e3eabe645bcfd350b04855)"
community_chat,Tell the mods there that you think it'd be cool :) 
community_chat,"Kick is already in place. You can kick for 10 min, 1 hour, 1 day, or 3 days. Or you can permaban ;)"
community_chat,"We recently scoped a basic system like this, yes. I don‚Äôt have a specific timeline yet, but it‚Äôs pretty high on my list. I think the early version of this bot would be pretty minimal but should be able to watch for blacklisted words or urls and then take action on the message or the user who sent it. Does that make sense?"
FortNiteBR,Gone now
FortNiteBR,I think that was done in error and should be resolved now :)
community_chat,This should be fixed now
community_chat,"We should have your #2 problem addressed now \- although it may be a bit too in your face atm. We make the chat icon orange red when there is new activity in any rooms you're a member of.

For you're first question, we do plan to add archiving of old Direct chats, but I don't have a specific timeline yet.

Hope that helps!"
community_chat,"I think this is a cool idea, but I'm not sure how quickly we'll get to something like it. For the short term, people sometimes group rooms by prefixing them with some characters. For instance:

r/magicTCG

* CD Red
* CD Black
* CD White
* CD Green
* CD Blue
* US Battlebond
* US Core 19
* T September
* T October"
community_chat,We're working on this and a couple of other scrolling bugs. Thanks for bearing with us in beta :\)
community_chat,"We are working on the ability to mute specific rooms yes, as well as mute globally."

Judaism,Thanks for reporting this! We are aware of it and are working on a fix :) sorry it's weird for now...beta and all ;)
modnews,I like onions but respect those who don‚Äôt too
community_chat,"Gah, good catch!"
modnews,"The mods moderating other mods bug will be fixed very shortly if not already. This feature is opt in only, and in early beta. The only people that can join rooms are people who have been invited to the beta explicitly, which is a very small number of folks. We‚Äôre looking for subs that want to be early adopters and who can help us define our roadmap for chat rooms. We understand that there‚Äôs a lot we still need to do to make moderation better, and we‚Äôll be working on features to support that continuously and specifically over the next few months. Although rooms can‚Äôt be deleted by mods yet, we will have that ability released very soon. If things get out of hand somehow before then, we can manually delete rooms for people. I understand the weariness around opting in now for some people, but I also wanted to let you know where we are today, and that we‚Äôll work with people to fix things if needed."
modnews,"We'll soon be releasing the ability to lock rooms. Locking a room will be similar to locking a thread \- no one will be able to send messages in a chat room while it's locked. This would let mods do what you're suggesting pretty easily I think, although hopefully, over time, moderation will be streamlined enough that you won't feel like this is a thing you need to do."
modnews,"This is how subreddit chat rooms work currently. In the chat inbox there's a list of rooms you're a member of. Each room is nested under a subreddit subheader. You can move between all of the rooms in any sub you're in very seamlessly I think. Once you're joined in a room, you don't need to navigate to a subreddit to see its rooms."
modnews,"I can understand some of the frustration yes. We‚Äôll have to prove to you through through real work and released improvements over time that we care a lot about all of those things you listed. I don‚Äôt personally have a lot to do with features outside of chat, but I will say that there are teams dedicated now to improving mod tools, search, and listening to concerns/making changes based on feedback about the redesign. 

As far as chat goes, our team is very very focused on making good moderation tools for chat rooms now. It‚Äôs probably all we‚Äôll work on for the next several months at least. Things like editing/deleting rooms, locking rooms, muting a user, and roles and permissions are high on our list of priorities. Automod for chat, username mentions for certain roles, and a system for 3rd parties to build onto our stuff are all also being through through and designed now. We really do care about mods as they‚Äôre a big part of what makes reddit great. We‚Äôre a small team, but we‚Äôre going to work hard to make chat rooms something that communities who want to opt in to can feel confident and good about. Sorry for the wall of text - just trying to thoughtful here."
