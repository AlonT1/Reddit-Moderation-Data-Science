politics,"I know this, and I love you"
politics,"We also try not to editorialize, that is to say, impose our opinions on the subreddit, either implicitly or explicitly. While implementing tags is relatively simple, we would essentially be giving our ""opinion"" on whatever the thing is we tagged, and that would be editorializing.  Again, if it's not something we can objectively determine, we're as apt to deal with it incorrectly as we are correctly, and so taking no action is often preferable, especially in a system where the users choose what content is visible."
politics,"We don't have the ability to objectively identify users who may or may not be acting in ""bad faith"" from the perspective of posting with an agenda.  That's far more the purview of Reddit.  If we took action on that front, we'd be removing and banning blind, and as likely to remove or ban a user that was simply posting their mind as someone that was potentially a bad actor.  It's better to leave that sort of thing to the admins, while we focus on the things we can objectively police (or at least, much more objectively)."
