PoliticalHumor,"We liscense our cars, our mortgages, our taxes, even our kids in way. I don't think a gun confiscation is a serious threat personally, and we are the only developed country on earth that does not license firearms. 

Limiting guns reduces the number in the black market and increases the price of illegal firearms. Because most weapons ultimately come from some legitimate purchase or resale upstream, having owners produce their owned firearms and lockboxes each year or two makes illegal sales much harder. 

Unlike drugs, which there have international sources and will always find demand- illegal guns are pretty exclusively used to commit other crimes or be sold to people who should not own them, increasing the price of them will reduce those risks.

We could save tens of thousands of lives a year with these measures and a few more."
PoliticalHumor,"No I don't either, our best research shows stuff like lockboxes, child-access laws, separating ammo in some situations- lowers suicide and homicide the most.

And to my point that more guns tends to lead to more homicide/suicide overall- I don't think the solution is taking away guns, just license them and make sure every private sale is background checked.

If you limit the number of guns one person can own outside collector's items, or at least run all private sales through a background check while having two year inspections at your local PD, we could lower gun violence a ton in this country. 

Most illegal weapons are not shipped here internationally, they go into the black market after a legitimate sale and sometimes many legitimate private resales."
PoliticalHumor,"Instead of relying on individual studies, which I agree can always be subject to bias- we can use meta-analyses that collect all the statistically robust studies and compare their findings.

Annals of internal medicine produced the largest systematic review and meta-analysis of firearm risk factor studies to date. 

[The meta-analysis](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M13-1301) found that the presence of a gun is associated with a higher chance of death. Suicide is a big factor, the risk factor can increase 10x for certain age groups if a gun is in the home, but the risk of homicide increased as well.

Suicide and domestic attacks are very impulsive decisions. Having a gun on hand makes an explosively emotional moment into a permanently lethal decision.

While you do have researchers like Kleck who claim defensive usage offsets this obvious risk increase, outside of a single study from the 90s no peer reviewed research has ever concluded firearms are associated with lower rates of homicide when controlling for individual households."
PoliticalHumor,"We could and I have, I studied gun violence epidiemology and these topics have been debated by smarter people than us. 

This is one of those situations where we are talking from very different information ecosystems. Both of us feel that even if one or two data points are not kosher the body of evidence overwhelmingly makes our case anyways.

But if I can convince you of anything, let it be this- the defensive gun usage numbers produced by Richard Kleck are bunk- and have been widely viewed as such for years. I'm not going to iniduate you with studies, but I can confidently say the majority firearm research has concluded the presence of a gun in a home makes the chance of death net higher. 

If we control for social and economic variables and compare households with and without a gun, we find a gun is associated with a higher chance of suicide and homicide- this implies the defensive usage does not outweigh the increased risk."

PoliticalHumor,">She doesn't prioritize oneself over others. You keep saying that and it isn't true. She never said that.

Rand in her own words describes her ""moral code"" as ""the highest moral purpose is the achievement of his own happiness \[…\] that each man must live as an end in himself, and follow his own rational self-interest. "" There no disagreement that she ""argues for a self-centered objectivist mindset that prioritizes your well being and that of your family over subsidizing others.""

I mean her famous line is literally "" What if, instead I advice you to put **yourself first** and be selfish to get better, you will condemn me for daring to suggest something like that. ""

>Your statement does not invalidate my point. Yes we must work to survive. We must consume resources to survive.

I mean in aggregate sure, but lots of people don't work. That's why Rand's observations are pointlessly obvious- No one disagrees that there must be work to keep an economy running; that's accepted by capitalists and socialists alike. The question is to what extent we provide social welfare, which Rand only ever engages in on a speculative level.

>She absolutely supports welfare, charities, etc.

Rand ""opposed all forms of welfare statism"" that was not restituional- i.e. Social security. She basically called charity ""fine I guess"".

>I never stated welfare should be dismantled, and neither did Rand.

Rand opposed all government benefit programs in the US openly until a later age when she begrudgingly accepted the need for social security.

My problem with Rand is not that she's always wrong, more that she's just very boring and usually amounts to making bizarrely obvious and pointless observations. Even after all this conversation, we are no closer to pinning down her actionable moral framework that would be any different from how you or I live our lives.

It was devastating for a lot of black communities, but Biden and Harris were nothing unique. Certainly better than republicans of the same era. 

Trump continued the Veterans choice act, a bill sponsored by John McCain and signed into law by obama. He did little to expand it's provisions and ultimately made much smaller reforms than Obama originally did in his 2nd term.

Trump has pardoned 23 individuals, offered clemency for 12 more. 5 of those were drug related offenses, which he only commuted after being personally lobbied by and advisor. 

Obama commuted nearly 2000, largely black and brown drug convictions.

> She doesn't advocate helping yourself, or getting rich, or trying to put yourself over others at all. To Rand those are completely superficial concepts.

Rand strongly argues for a self-centered objectivist mindset that prioritizes your well being and that of your family over subsidizing others. It is one of her many self contradictions.

She did criticize parasitic banking, while also writing:

> by which I mean that he has to hold reason as his only guide to action, and that he must live by the independent judgment of his own mind; that his highest moral purpose is the achievement of his own happiness […] that each man must live as an end in himself, and follow his own rational self-interest.

Another inconsistency. Her ""new moral paradigm"" is little more than a minimal state with no welfare and only lassiez-faire economic policies. You say it's a scientific fact that our societies *must* revolve around the value of work- and yet we have almost universally rejected total lassiez-faire economic policy in most modern economies.

Dismantling welfare is not actually the most efficient or collectively rational economic solution. Another of her problems, the biggest reason she is excluded from classrooms, is she essentially does not engage in any outside economic theory or past philosophy to justify these arguments.

It's not a philosophy, it's an adolescent and hateful series of self help books."
PoliticalHumor,"What's sad is we want the same thing, you just don't understand enough about congressional politics to realize your path is slower.

This is what most people call living your life as a normal person. Rand attached a lot of fake philosophical langauge, sexism, and contempt for welfare to what is normally a truism.

She has a fundemental misunderstanding of government and the economy and makes few points outside attacking people who try to better the world."

Our gun homicide rate is 25x higher, our homicide rate 7x higher [than similarly developed nations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26551975/).

They tried to reverse the child protections and mandated every crossing be deferred for criminal prosecution.

There is 0 court precedent or legislation requiring this. 

The DoJ estimates between 20-30% of migrants miss their immigration court hearings. That rate actually increased in 2016, 2017, and 2018 (no comprehensive data for 2019).

But that's why there's red-blooded patriots like me, protecting the country from people like you."
politics,"No I really don't know how to conceptualize the sheer amount of death for people like you anymore without  talking about comparable numbers.

The devastation upon our population from the largest war in human history was only about 33% higher than how many Americans we've lost already- that should be your frame of reference. The amount of death is staggering.

Were the fuck did all our country's patriots go?"
politics,"What you see as malice and manipulation is what I would describe as: reddit.

Yeah, reddit self curates and tracks your biases to show the product you will spend the most time looking at, that is literally their business model.

All social media algorithms are written with the sole intent of capturing intent, but convinced yourself they also do so with political intent. Reddit doesn't care about your politics if it doesn't affect their business or public relations. 

That's why it's not very good for getting your political news, it's designed to be a self reinforcing echo chamber not a news platform."

I'm highly political, always have been. When you spend a lot of that time in that partisan space it helps to see political opponents as people who just disagree with you- which I usually do.

With COVID and denying our election results it changed. When people peddle that bullshit I don't think they have bad ideas anymore, I think they're just bad people. That's a really toxic space to be in and I loathe it."

politics,I think people also often justify not digging more deeply into political debates by saying both sides are the same or useless.
politics,It's almost like helping your local food bank has nothing to do with whether we pass national stimulus.
politics,"Yes you have been lied to or misinformed. There is no evidence of the voter fraud you described. 

Let's put it this way- we can disagree about how common and systemic voter fraud is, sure. But if you legitimately think trump is still going to win this election you're so deluded that to explain why you are wrong would require you understanding enough about our government it shouldn't be needed.

It's a catch-22 and classic example of dunning-kreuger. I can't convince you you're wrong if it requires a level of sophistication that would make that fact already clear."
politics,No and I think they capture a pretty incredible portion of US addresses in their potential sample pool.
politics,"The House declined to take a recess until october, skipping the august and sep recesses. The day before the october recess they passed the skinny 2.2T package that failed in the Senate. This is after they passed the original 3.4T package that failed in the senate.

McConnell did not let it get to the floor. He said republcians would refuse to consider anything over 2 T.

In 2017 republicans passed a 1.9T tax cut."

politics,"Before this election a greater number of young people and americans as a whole stated the outcome was ""important or very important"" than any time in modern history when polled. 

Just having a pulse and functioning set of eyes these last four years should be enough to confirm people were way more invested in this election than most.

You have been lied to or misinformed. We did not have more votes than eligible voters in any state, though sometimes eligible voter rolls are out of date."
politics,"No the senate primarily rejected the Democrat spending package because they did not want 400B in state aid.

It was not bill riders, it was an explicit disagreement over whether our states and elections should get big chunks of funding relief."

politics,"The pulse survey us an experimental data modeling program that uses on online survey of ~1m people weekly. The exact sample size varies week to week as it is determined by having to meet a confidence interval for the nation as a whole.

Those age splits are the most common age demographics you see in any kind of surveying. It's meant to resemble the actual age divides in this country, (18-21 yo's have specific concerns, 30-45 is the primary homestarting demo, 65+ are all retirees).

news,"The strongest piece of evidence is the expected death rate. More than ~300k americans have died in 2020 than what we would have expected in a normal year.

Because lockdowns and economic depressions otherwise drive death rates down (people are driving, working, laboring, interacting less), we'd expect overall mortality to fall if not for the virus.

That means we are probably undercounting not overxounting the death toll."

Simplest way to explain this: when a mommy and a daddy love each very much, they'll have a baby together. Those babies grow up and vote in greater numbers than 12 years ago."

politics,"Technically you can commit administrative malpractice by firing someone for any reason that is personal but claimed as a governmental interest. There is very little set precedent on how such laws are applied to the president.

That said trump is vocally disagreeing with the Kreb'a position on the election. However deluded the president may be doesn't mean he is no longer the head of the exectuive that can fire people over policy differences.

What trump did today was unamerican, immoral, and political.

EDIT: I should say a lot of the clinton, and to a lesser extent Nixon litigation did set some bounds on what the president can be criminally charged with while executing the duties of office. You *absolutely can* bring federal charges against a president, but many administrative malpractice issues are seen as only resovable through impeachment. (Civil court after office unsettled)"

2008 mortality fell, 2001 mortailty fell, 1978 mortality fell. During the *Great Depression* mortailty fell...

There is no indication in 2020 data that increased levels of homicide or suicide would offset those forces, meaning ~300k people have died because of the Virus in the US."

You've been too inundated with misinformation- what you see as evidence everywhere is really almost nothing consequential. 

It's BS from Trump. And he's not saying ""let's do some audits and legal challenges and accept the results then"". He called it rigged two days after the election, and will call it rigged no matter what.

Unamerican and unpatriotic."

2016 did see the highest levels of contesting the election in public polling, but after a few months we were back to the norm.

In 2000 over 30% of democrats contested the election... for about 3 months.

In reality we haven't had an election after which the results are widly denied by one party in modern history. Hillary Clinton conceded the race the next day, and talks about why/how she lost all the damn time. She does not contest the results, I read her book."

Most don't pay any attention to that, or should, the canidate they support is given next to their name.

Selected by the voters means that the electors are assigned based on the popular vote in the state not the state congress."
politics,"Most likely. It is sort of the defintion of a consitutional work around, so depending on the court it could be in danger."

Gore did not contest the results, attack the process, or claim fraud. **The major networks called flordia for Gore for 2 hours not a month...**. It was put back into undecided by 10 pm est.

Flordia also came down to an actual recount, the outcome of which could decide the presidency. Trump is not within recount ranges in any state, and will only receive one in GA so far. He has a 0% chance of becoming president."

UpliftingNews,Yes I quoted you.
UpliftingNews,"Em, you can do both. In fact the vast majority of animal rights activists I know are also environmentalists. 

Because of the carbon impact of factory farming, animal rights activists and environmentalists goals are more aligned than not."
UpliftingNews,"There is something wrong with wearing fur, the vast majority of which is done by rich customers not the Inuit."
UpliftingNews,Weird that you chose the one animal famous for producing clothes without needing to be killed.
UpliftingNews,"No I think the issue is it takes a ton of animals being slaughtered to make what is a pretty superfluous and tacky fashion statement.

Even animal leather is falling out of fashion and that at least has unique practical advantages."
UpliftingNews,"Except contracting meat consumption and animal product industries would greatly benefit the environment. 1000 calories of meat or milk is much more carbon expensive to produce than 1000 calories of vegetables or corn. 

Protecting the environment is not about trying to alter the natural world for the better. The natural world will survive, our quality of life will not without changes. That is what we are trying to save."

Vote tabulation buildings are monitored. All ballot totals are checked over and over again from open to close. Chain of custody is recorded. 

There is no way to secretly dump tens of thousands of ballots while people are asleep and have it missed in tomorrow's count."

If a malicious actor wanted to send in illegal votes, why would they wait for as long as possible and endanger the viability of those votes?"

We will only have a handful of faithless electors, many decisive states like PA do not allow them at all. Anything else would be unamerican."
politics,"Well we can't have it both ways. Trump only really had a chance because of his numbers on the economy, which remained his best issue up to his loss.

Both the decisive demographics that won trump the election in 2016 (white suburbs in the midwest and obama/Romney voters), and americans as a whole, saw faster GDP and employment growth under Obama. The mean household income also rose for the first time in decades, while slowing under the Trump admin.

Some of this just does not make practical sense, some of it is actively misleading.

This guy is full of it."
politics,"Al Gore didn't actually make those claims, I'm beginning to worry about your personal bullshit filter working.

Stat grad student here- Benford's law both has not been violated this election and is not a suitable tool to audit elections. For Benford's law to work the data set needs several orders of magnitude; that's why it can used to analyze tax fraud, but not how many children a household has.

Precincts are designed to be as close to the same size as possible. Their turnout is similar, and rarely more than 2-3 standard deviations from either extreme. That makes a benford distribution **impossible and guaranteed to get non-1 digit mean repetition**."
politics,"Jesus. Quick history lesson- there is mo consitutional mechanism or precedent for when someone is officially ""president-elect"". There is no protected term or legal status either, nor does that change once the electors vote.

As it stands now, liberal democrats in New York and California actually have relatively more power because of the EC and how many Republican votes are ignored there. Because of the EC, 11 states receive 95% of campaign resources and time."
politics,"I don't understand why people keep defending the EC with ""we're a republic not a democracy bro""

The United States is a Democratic Republic, which is a form of democracy. The Electoral College is not a form of representation, since we don't really have independent electors anymore.

politics,"He is a conservative, so I'm not surprised he secured another conservative justice.

He has 0 future as a potential GOP/Independent nominee, his impeachment vote and trump criticism guarenteed that.

This election proved rank and file republcians very much support the president, romney has no future with them."
politics,"People don't know enough background on Romney. George Romney, his father, was one of the most racially progressive politicans in both parties in the 60s; he fought desperately against what he saw as a white supremacist push in the GOP to create a diverse party.

He lost to nixon, and lost the soul of what was once the progressive party in the nation. He is the Republican party Americans deserved, not the party of white interests we got after the civil rights act."

But whether you agree or not, a popular vote is coming. Population disparities between places like Wyoming and Texas are growing; when will it be too much for your personally? When someone has 5x my vote? 10x? 50x?"
politics,"It was designed to give slave states an acceptable handicap. James Madison favored a national popular vote but couldn't get southern convention members on board. VT and ME actually agreed with him.

The electoral college harms rural states as much as big ones. Because neither are typically swing states, they do not recieve the 95% of national campaign resources that go to that group.

For centuries it didn't even systemically favor rural voters. Because it created the ever crucial swing state, wherever the election was most competitive generated the most value from the college. That's why John Kerry was advantaged in the 2004 electoral college relative to Bush despite having a less rural coalition than Obama."
politics,"Well California didn't exsist in the 1700s, but the EC works was divided the way it was to give slave states a handicap and get them onboard.

James Madison, who wrote our constitution, wanted a national popular vote. But he decided the pretty weak compromise they settled on was the easiest path forward."

No shit Biden's lead would shrink if you took out 12% of democratic votes, just as much as Biden ""only"" won the popular vote if you count MI/WI/PA/VI/OH  


Did trump only win becuase of texas? That's 9% of his vote"
politics,"Thank God this country values freedom, democracy, and law and order- over people like you.

You are speaking nonsense. You are not a patriot, you leech America's greatness by proximity alone."
politics,I think his lack of it is partly why he just lost an incumbency.
politics,"The policies he campaigned on more than any other were universal coverage under the ACA and expanding Medicaid. It is likely to be his highest legislative priority, like the ACA in 2008.  


Expanding the ACA is much more popular now but the Senate margin is not decided."
politics,"No, GA, PA, NV, WI, and MI counted for hours into the night. They have been telling us for weeks to expect the initial results to vary widely because of mail in ballots.

It's not rocket science, trump spent the last 7 months telling his supporters not to vote by mail. Those states count mail in ballots after election day- put 2 and 2 together. 

You really think Brian fucking Kemp rigged the election against trump in Georgia? You really think Democrats could fake hundreds of thousands of ballots but would do so badly in congress this year?

No war is coming. Grow the fuck up and join the actual red-blooded patriots in supporting democracy."
politics,"What's sad is democeats largely accept 2016, as will most Republican lawmakers."
politics,"He intends to expand medical coverage to every american, something that has been attempted since FDR.

We largely still have the systems of subsidized education, social security, and Medicare that were created by FDR- Biden seeks to expand them.

Biden's healthcare proposal would be the largest public program in our history. Larger than medicare and social security combined."
politics,"Yes, by most measures Biden's platoform is objectively more progressive. Maybe not for the time, but still more so."
politics,"And yet we just elected the most progressive platform in our entire history. I blame our voters, not our canidates."

I have this suspicion you think democeats didn't have a chance on monday either. Maybe you should start reevaluating those certainties."

PoliticalHumor,Were you ever a patriot?
PoliticalHumor,You've been lied to.
politics,"That majority also tend to dislike republicans. 

Joe Biden does not attack Obama because conservatives dislike him, that would make no electoral sense.

Romney did what he did because of a crisis of conscious."
politics,"So when trump tweets in all caps ""STOP THE VOTE COUNT"" and declares victory in MI/WI, what he really means is ""we should ensure only legitimate ballots are being counted and rely on the legitimate results of the election"".

Alternatively, you could stop being mentally abused by this man."
politics,"To who? He may do things you disagree with, but this is winning him no popularity contests that matter."
politics,"It cost him a lot of power in Congress, and showed he prioritized censuring trump over his own career.

I do not agree with mitt romney, that is why I campaigned against him. But if we had 20 more mitt romney's trump would have been removed from office."
politics,That vote cost him around ~10 points in his home state and almost all of his clout in the senate caucus.
politics,"That's not true though. Americans of the losing party generally accept both the 2016 and especially the 2008 reuslts.

This may be the first time in American history a large portion of the electorate views a win as legitimate for longer than 6 months. All trump's doing."
politics,"No, it's really not. Trump claimed he won states he did not, he demanded to stop the count of legitimate ballots, and he claimed democrats were rigging elections run by republicans.   


He did not accept legal ballots, he tried to destroy them. Unamerican and ridiculous to support if you are a patriot."
politics,"He is the only senator to vote to impeach a president of the same party in american history, there are almost no other options that would be so explicitly against trump."
politics,"He voted to remove trump from office...

People want republicans to turn on trump but don't realize that would come in the from of Romney."
politics,It would not. He is an unfocused and politically inept man.

Warhammer,"I'm confused, are warhammer stories really being launched right now?"
politics,"MI, PA, and WI state election boards have come out and explicitly said not to expect results day of. Florida will be easier to count, as will NH, AZ and NV.

Even then none of those states are guarenteed to post results for days."
politics,"You keep talking about how you and your limited social circle feel about Obama- that doesn't matter so much as how do average and swing voters feel.

With the voters that Biden is trying to win, obama is more popular. That's why polls are useful, they give us insight to how people think that may not agree with us.."
politics,"Simple- obama is more popular than biden.

If you associate your campaign with something that is more popular than your current position- it helps you.

Not sure why this is debatable."
politics,"Obama is the most popular president still alive- trump is the least popular in modern history. Obama has higher approval than biden, his presence is a net positive. 

I think it's sort of insane to claim otherwise."

politics,"Jesus, so many words, so little said."
politics,"It's not whether Nebraska will receive a ton of attention, but whether it will receive more than under the electoral college. The answer there is a definitive yes.  


Unless you are PA, MI, WI, NC, FL, MN, NV or AZ- you receive far less attention and resources because of the electoral college. Even then, I'm totally fine with groups of people getting more attention when there are 40x the number of citizens there.  


To put that 1.3M in perspective, it's almost 10x the margin Clinton lost by."
politics,"What are you off about? You claimed people weren't considering the downside of this change- that's total nonsense. Of course people understand that a popular means a republican could be elected. Do you think people expect abolishing the electoral college will lead to only democrats for the rest of time?

And you assumed pretense, not me. You're claiming people are only fighting this because it advantages them. Democrats have been pushing for a popular vote for 2 decades, even when it benefited them."
politics,It's really very refreshing to hear some pragmatic but still critical understanding of US foreign policy from foreigners who have no reason to respect us at this point.
politics,"I'm not sure how else to explain this to you except to emphasize: Liberals in New York and California have MORE influence over the presidency because of the electoral college. FEWER states receive attention, and small states are IGNORED."
politics,"The person who wins the most votes becoming president is not backfiring, it's simply the will of the people and I would accept it.  


For the record, I have been advocating for this change for a decade. Republicans didn't actually benefit from the EC back then. Both Obama and Kerry were relatively favored by the EC against their opponents ('12 & 04'), and I thought it was just as dumb then."
politics,Excess mortality shows that we are actually *undercounting* COVID deaths. That's just an objective fact.
politics,"While the EC does give smaller states more representation in aggregate, it's goofy structure causes them to be all but ignored in presidential politics. Right now, there is 0 incentive for democrats to waste time in Nebraska, or to give them any concessions. A popular vote would change that.  


The EC causes fewer states to campaigned in because swing states are objectively the only ones that matter in getting to 270. Abolishing it would force candidates to go to many new places outside the 11 states that get the vast, vast majority of attention right now.  


Also, states like California and New York are actually *more* valuable democrats because of the EC. If both used a popular vote instead of ignoring \~7M conservative votes, those states would give republicans proportionally more representation in a popular vote than in the EC. I can ""show my work"" for why that is true if that's helpful."
40kLore,"I love this observation, really defines the stagnation of nurgle and the false benevolence."
politics,"Small states are hurt by the EC, and have their fates decided by \~11 swing states instead of the nation as a whole.   


Unless you live in a swing state, you receive less presidential campaign resources and attention with the EC. Without it, Democrats would be forced to appeal to rural america, Republicans would have to moderate for republicans in California."
politics,"If by backfire you mean a republican could be elected with the popular vote, then that seems totally fine to me."
politics,"That's what we already get because of the Electoral College. 95% of presidential campaign resources are spent in the same 11 states.  


With the EC in place, Trump has 0 reason to waste time in Oregon; Democrats won't bother going to Oklahoma. Without the EC, between 35-50% of every state in the union is up for grabs.  


Getting rid of the college would for presidential candidates to appeal to a much broader group of voters, making both parties less extreme and divided."
politics,"Thank you. I for one love that we have red and blue states, minority state parties having 0 voice, and 95% of campaign resources being spent on 10 states.  


I should clarify though that I'm a complete dipshit."
politics,"Better framing would be- should every Chinese citizen get the same vote for their president?

Yes, of course. Basic stuff."
politics,"We have excess mortality figures, find just one person who has studied epidemiology at your place of work to explain why that shows we are *undercounting* COVID-19 deaths"
politics,"This is total nonsense. The last 6 months are the first time in american history the healthcare market suffered a depression. Hospitals are short staffed, using furlough, and sometimes rationing care.  


COVID, and the resources it costs, has devastated the healthcare admin."
politics,"Except it's not a representative based system anymore, it is essentially a popular vote- with a rural handicap.

Without faultless electors, there is no representative that is making decisions on your behalf. It is a state popular vote, that weighs land unlike any other developed country."
politics,"That's an easier to swallow compromise, and one of the most likely outcomes. But it also doesn't make sense- a proportional electoral college would have (in retrospect) still ended with the popular vote winner coming out ahead in every American election.  


It would also serve 0 of it's original purposes at that point. It's only effect on our elections would be to give rural areas a very small handicap."
politics,"While the popular vote compact's legal future isn't settled, it definitely has a chance of going into effect where an amendment will not."
politics,Because?
politics,"Instead of complaining let's try to fix things. The electoral college is a huge reason our 2 party system exists, it makes 3rd party runs much more difficult."
politics,"You're right they don't- if anything COVID lockdowns are likely to depress mortality *more* than past recessions.

Never has a recession caused a standstill on our highways and roads. They've never put the majority of americans at home, not doing physical labor or spreading the flu.

Evey severe recession in the past demonstrates this is true. It's just not very likely that upticks in suicide and violent crime come close to mitigating the fact we are all at home and safe."
politics,Okay but the electoral college **heavily** incentivizes a two party system. A popular vote would be massively more friendly to 3rd party canidates.
politics,The exact same as it does now but without red and blue state dichotomies on election day.
politics,Because of the electoral college California is actually propotionally more valuable to democrats than in a popular vote because of how many republican ballots are wasted there.
politics,"We have almost a century of recession data to look at. For example, the average lifespan generally increased during [the great depression](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/41/17290#:~:text=Population%20health%20did%20not%20decline,females%2C%20whites%2C%20and%20nonwhites) and the [2008 recession](https://voxeu.org/article/economic-crises-and-mortality)

It's a widly accepted concept in public health."
politics,"It is, but the increased death rate from suicide is dwarfed by roofers not working alone. This is why average lifespan actually [increased](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/41/17290#:~:text=Population%20health%20did%20not%20decline,females%2C%20whites%2C%20and%20nonwhites) during the great depression."
politics,"If we look at excess mortality, or the number of deaths vs. our expectations for the year, we see [we are probably undercounting](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) COVID-19 deaths.  


Because people are staying indoors more, not driving and doing far less physical labor- excess mortality should be trending down in a lockdown. So any increase is directly attributable to COVID."

You'll just get angrier, and blame anyone but yourself."

politics,You might enjoy [this clip he made.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLS2D_UREQE)
politics,"What are you talking about? He is explictly claiming fact check labels, largely from twitter, are equivalent to censorship. I'm sort of shocked that's even up for debate.

It's largely in reference to when trump had several tweets labeled with fact checks, and proceeded to cry censorship, attack the company publicly, and sign executive orders targeted at their independence."
politics,"Well Gary Johnson did better than most and only got 3.68% of the vote. From a party strategy perspective, by voting for a 3rd party you are signaling your vote is much harder to win than the average swing voter.

I can see how a vote in a safe state can seem wasted if you dislike both parties, but I wonder, what if you find yourself having never supported a winning candidate in your entire lifetime? Ultimately to see the changes you want it requires getting people who agree with you into office. Protest votes are very easy to ignore, primaries less so."
politics,"Postmarks come from the post office, which would have records on their end to verify what date it was received. Many states allow up to 7 days after the election to receive ballots delayed in the post.   


I wouldn't be worried about this as an avenue for fraud. An actual effort to impact an election using thousands of fraudulent ballots is basically impossible."
politics,"Yeah I think that's totally reasonable, I guess where I differ is I want the biggest impact on national platforms as possible, so they more closely resemble my views."
politics,"Trump is saying states should be forced to call a winner by the end of Nov. 3rd. He has also claimed ballots post marked before the election but received after should not be counted.

The first claim is toothless, and will be ignored. The 2nd has largely come down in favor of mail-in ballot advocates depending on the state, but there is litigation still going on."
politics,"I think the fact only a single state rep in the country is viable to win this year for the L party is indicative of how effective it is.  


Our election system handicaps 3rd parties too much for them to be effective outside very local offices."
politics,"Whether or not mail-in ballots post marked before the election but received after the 3rd can be counted varies on the state and impending legal cases- but trump is referencing ballots already received on election day but unable to be counted in full that same night.  


I think there should be 0 controversy over whether my state has to count all ballots it has gotten by election day to certify a winner."
politics,"21 states do not allow the counting of ballots until election day, early voting, mail-in or otherwise.

Trump is not referring to late arriving mail, but states being able to count the ballots they do have after election day. It is just not possible for some states to certify a winner within 5 hours (they have to wait for poll close). Michigan and Wisconsin SoS have come out and explicitly said it is not possible.

Just because I voted early doesn't mean my vote shouldn't be counted, that is the case for many seniors and US service people. I really cannot believe that needs saying to some people."
politics,"You say opinion pieces, I say objective fact.

Weird how all these outlets specifically designed to settle such a debate agree with me.

Giving someone a 2nd and more accurate clarification is called fact checking. Censoring would be preventing a private company like Twitter from doing so."
politics,"""When I use the word censor, I mean... **fact check[ing]...**""

No sure where the confusion is here."
politics,"No he specifically meant states tallying votes after election day, not votes in the mail after election day- which has also been a source of controversy this week."
politics,"What's sad is how much more Orwellian your argument is than twitter fact checking.

1984 is not about censorship but the manipulation of language. Calling an objective fact check a ""censor"" to prevent to truth from coming out is text book Orwellian.

Twitter and facebook have done a limited amount of fact checking, and demonitized or deplatformed people who broke their exsisting ToS."
politics,"Yes, facts exsists. It is the job of the media to inform us on objective facts.

I'm not concerned about the ""pendulum swinging back"" because I intend to remain on the side of objective fact.

What if twitter suddenly disagrees with me about what that is? Then that still wouldn't be censorship.."
politics,"You missed it so I'll highlight it for you:

> ""When I use the word 'censor' here, I'm meaning blocked content, **fact-check**, or labeled content, or demonetized websites of conservative, Republican, or pro-life individuals or groups or companies”"
politics,"Objective facts do exsist in a vaccum, and so far I've never seen a media outlet so delusional that their fact checking department becomes truly partisan. Not at Fox or MSNBC."
politics,"I think a critical piece missing there is we have actual facts on our side, Mike Lee does not.

Twitter knowingly lying or having leadership so conservative they target liberal messages is a way bigger lift some basic election fact checking.

I think fact checking is fine because I believe in objective truth. What if twitter disagrees on what is a fact? I don't think that's too likely and we could be anxious about the same thing for literally any outlet then."

It's not a big problem, it's not realistically possible to rig an election that way so people don't really try. You are depriving voters of their voice by believing otherwise.

More insidious, the people who suggest these laws understand this. They know the objective is turnout depression, not security. You're buying into that strategy of theirs."
politics,"It's not that such a crime is impossible, it's that to reliably affect an election (which would presumably be the goal if you go to so much effort), you would need thousands upon thousands of people *at a minimum*.

It's just not possible to get that many people to commit a felony with a 8 year maximum sentence and have everyone stay quiet.

For that reason, cases of voter fraud are nearly non exsistant.

And there is verification, you need the correct registered name and address. Someone stealing your vote would also have to rely on you not voting."
politics,"You're so close to understanding why you will keep getting these riots without systemic reform.

What did you expect when another black man was executed?"
politics,"It deprives people of their vote because we can demonstrably show that more people who casted a legitimate ballot in accordance with the law are disqualified than fraudulent ballots. 

If we can prevent 5 cases of fraud, but it costs 50 ballots wrongly thrown away, that is not acceptable. 

Election interference =/= voter fraud. Russia *is* attempting to manipulate our elections, voters committing fraud is vanishingly rare. So rare, that even the trump admin has failed to bring any substantial cases to light.

Signature checks will always destroy more valid votes than fraudulent ones. An inherent problem with being this risk adverse to voter fraud is that to reliably mess with an election- you'd need to enlist thousands of people to commit felonies.

There is no universe in which you can get that number of people to commit a crime and keep it a secret. Individual voter fraud is almost nonexistent."
politics,"For this specific ballot security measure, more legitimate votes are thrown away than illegitimate. Ultimately I think if preventing fraud deprives many more people of their right to vote, that's not an acceptable tradeoff.

Where I live now and work as an election judge, we verify name & address, and have them sign a poll book. We allow provisional ballots if something doesn't match, which are only audited if the election is close.

That prevents the vast majority of accidental and malicious ballot fraud. We've had 9 convictions for ballot fraud since 2018- which is high for most states"
politics,"No, and yet they had me acting a such. Pretty messed up right?"
politics,"Signatures can vary quite a lot over time. Both as a tool to find ballot fraud, and verify legitimate ballots- it fails miserably.

I also worked as an election judge in a signature verification state for a decade. I can tell you first hand how little oversight, science, or relaibility is involved."
politics,"[Several studies and a lawsuit](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/signature-matching-is-the-phrenology-of-elections/616790/) successfully won in ohio demonstrate the authentic signature rejection rate.
