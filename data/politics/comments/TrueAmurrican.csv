warriors,"New stadiums are always nice in their own way, but I just can’t get excited about Chase. Less seats (so less tickets available), more expensive, further away parking, and harder to get to for a lot of the Bay (it’s just about the same distance away from me, but it takes longer than it took to get to Oracle which was right off the freeway). 

I’m sure it’ll grow on me the longer it’s here, but it didn’t really solve any problems I had so it just doesn’t seem necessary."
warriors,At least they just shared a screenshot so it doesn’t give ESPN any traffic or ad revenue.
AskReddit,"This is a stretch in that I don’t want to make it sound like I was a victim, but it really sits heavy on my mind. 

One of the most exciting and fascinating music festivals I have ever been to is the Life is Beautiful festival in Las Vegas. The festival closes down a large section of the old downtown Las Vegas to have a music festival surrounded by the Vegas lights, and it’s incredibly unique. 

I have a distinct memory of the last time I attended that festival. We were at the stage for the headliner and sitting in the back after a long day, and I was just looking around and taking in the moment. We were surrounded by tall buildings at that stage, and I was looking up at all of them thinking how surreal this concert experience was to be happening where it was happening. 

One week later, the Vegas shooting happened at another music festival in another part of town. Immediately, I had some ‘holy shit we were just there’ thoughts, but then more information came out about the shooter. 

It turns out, that same moment I was relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere of the show and looking up at all the buildings surrounding us, the Las Vegas shooter was in one of the rooms overlooking us, with his guns he used a week later to kill 61 people. 

Nobody seems to know what their motive was, so who knows why they didn’t fire down at the festival we were at. Maybe it was a practice run, maybe something happened that caused him to back down that night. 

Either way, knowing that he was looking down at me as I looked up just twists my insides and has truly blackened that memory. It was such a positive moment, but there was such a dark force sharing it with me. 

As I said, it feels disingenuous to make it seem like I was in any particular danger that night because nothing happened to us, but I honestly do feel like we dodged a bullet that night."

Haven’t been this excited for a Warriors draft day for as long as I can remember, and then the Klay news hits. 

Fuck man, having a healthy and talented core is the entire reason this draft was exciting to begin with. We are supposed to be adding pieces today, not losing them...

Fuck. I know we don’t know much yet, so I’m going to hope this is just a scare and try to enjoy this, but it won’t be easy."

It’s completely unnecessary"
nba,Fuck man....
warriors,"I don’t know, this feels much different to me. It never felt like we were in a strong draft position before and it never felt like we were one pick away from success, so it was hard to be as excited. 

This year it feels like we have options, and on top of that we are adding to an incredibly capable core of players. It doesn’t feel like the dark ages anymore."

She was driving by an area with some pasture land and all of a sudden a freaking HORSE jumped out of the pasture and landed straight up on her car/ windshield as she drove by. She says the horse was able to walk away (who knows how it fared long term), but her car was totaled. She was straight traumatized by that experience (she didn’t see it coming at all) and still has back and neck pain to this day because of it. She only recently bought her first ‘brand new’ car since then this past year after being too scared to do so. 

Crazy freak accident."

politics,"As soon as I read the wording of the proposition I knew it would pass, but not for good reason. This bill was way too complicated for the average voter (I'm not even going to say I understand the entirety of the effects)

California just passed a privacy law in the past year, which went into effect on July 1st, 2020. That bill was fought against HARD by the tech company special interests, but it passed. Since it only went into effect a few months ago, we really haven't had a chance to experience it's effects.

This new porposition replaces a lot of that language, amending 54 pages of legislation in an effort to supposedly protect out privacy from these tech companies. So how much did these companies push back against this new bill? NOT AT ALL. Why? Because they helped write it, and it's much easier on them. And to top it all off, it allows them to charge consumers for the privilege of protecting their privacy. We get to pay a premium for privacy because we voted for that. Great.

I love California and I always will, but our proposition system is a curse."
politics,Anyone who is sure of the outcome as of this moment is going to be giving you a biased opinion. We need to count the votes. Both candidates have a path to victory still.

Thank you for responding. I am frustrated by bad faith content as well and I do understand what you are saying is a problem. Your feedback is not falling on deaf ears and I will bring it forward as we discuss solutions for bad faith users.

A user that is only offering baiting and bad faith arguments is violating our rules, which means they are eligible for a ban. If they are banned, they won't be continuing with that behavior on this sub for the duration of that ban. And while I can't speak for the entire team when I say this, I absolutely take into context the conversation when I see an argument between a bad faith user and another, and that does play into whether I issue a ban or not.

I don't think that you are restricted from saying something is in bad faith or is dishonest. That is not bannable in and of itself. There is a way to engage with a bad faith user, as you wait for mod action, without breaking our current civility rules.

Fall of Troy was absolutely amazing debuting Manipulator songs and Coheed had just put out No World for Tomorrow and had an amazing set. Just a perfect combo. 

But stuck in the middle of that awesome sandwich, was the band Clutch. 

I had nothing against Clutch coming into that show, but they were one of the worst live bands I ever saw that night. I don’t know if there was something else going on with them, but they just stood in place completely unenthused, drank some beer, and nearly put me to sleep while I was leaning against the barricade in front of the stage. Seriously. After the intense energy of a Fall of Troy set, I almost fell asleep at the show before Coheed came on. It was unforgettably bad. 

Rest of the show was amazing once Coheed took the stage though! I even got their set list, so I shouldn’t complain.

AskReddit,"It’s certainly a complex point. 

I personally value a politician that has had it ‘right’ for a long time. But I also value someone who is willing to change their mind when confronted with new and better information. It’s rare to have that trait, especially as a politician. 

Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to come up with the reason that someone’s opinion changed. Did they change because they truly believe it’s right? Did they change because they knew it would get more votes and they are desperate to be elected? Did they do it because someone contributed money to their campaign? Does it matter?

In many ways it doesn’t matter if the result is positive. But those questions make it more difficult to appreciate someone who changed their mind over someone who has been there forever. I like to think that some truths should be universal, and a politician that hasn’t held those same truths for long certainly gives reason for pause. They shouldn’t be ridiculed for changing their mind, but it think it’s fair to ask why it took them so long."

PublicFreakout,"I will not defend the chair at all in this situation, but just so you all know; Governing bodies in the State of California are bound by the Ralph M Brown Act, which is the public meeting laws. These laws require meetings to be open to the public, among other things, and require that the governing body provide a section in the meeting for public comments. The governing body is not allowed to set a limit on the total length of time for public comments, BUT they are allowed to set a limit on the amount of time that a person speaks AND the amount of time that the public is allowed to speak on one specific topic. Most of the time these bodies don't get a lot of public comments so these rules don't always come into play, but you can imagine there are times where public comments can take up an entire meeting even with those restrictions. 

All that being said, as an advisor to a governmental body, I would advise them to hear all of the constituents in a situation like this. This doesn't happen every day, and it would seem like best practice to give the people more time to express themselves in these incredible times.

politics,"I don’t know anyone who has died from lack of healthcare explicitly, but almost everyone I know has died from something that could have been addressed by a higher level of care. 

We are all going to die, but countless people die early because of a lack of healthcare. So many deaths are not attributed to healthcare because the link isn’t as direct, but it’s all related. 

A lack of insurance could mean you can’t afford to get treatment for an illness, but it can also mean you can’t take all the necessary steps to get adequate and frequent check-ups. 

My dad died due to complications from cancer that spread throughout his body. He had health insurance and that insurance did cover his treatment, but he still died before he turned 60. Why? Because the cancer had spread too far by the time they caught it. With all the retrospect in the world, there were signs he had cancer dating back years, but it went unnoticed due to the infrequent, surface level check-ups that insurance provided to him. 

It’s much deeper than whether or not you can provide treatment. The battle for your health starts much earlier."

Then, instead of paying to have the book bound, he just went to kinkos and made copies of the books for the class.

Without exceptions, I will inevitably drive right past Home Depot waiting for someone to pick up the phone. I’ve stubbornly waited over half an hour on the phone for someone to let me know if I’ll be able to spend my money there or not. 90% of the time, I will be forwarded to a department that never answers, put on a never ending hold, or transferred to an extension that eventually just ends the call.

nba,"It’s easier than ever to feel helpless as an individual when it comes to affecting global change. And for good reason. 

The issues with China are not new, and didn’t start when Morey wrote a tweet. But with one tweet and the subsequent backlash, those issues are almost louder than the start of the NBA preseason. Financial boycotts may be a most effective form of personal advocacy, but that isn’t the only way to potentially bring change to the way the NBA supports China. The backlash to the NBA’s reaction is already forcing them to make statements and take official stances, and it’s possible that keeping the conversation going and the pressure on the NBA could lead to a permanent change in how the NBA works with China. 

I’m pretty pessimistic about any change coming, but I will always find it hard to agree that the best alternative is not talking about something and forgetting about it."

videos,"That's not exactly what I'm talking about. I fully agree with you that the struggle to get through a project is part of what's appealing about the show. I'm more calling out what seems to me like an increase in her talking about not wanting to come back another day, taking longer breaks between filming within a single episode, and pushing for a not-as-complete product to end the episode as soon as possible.

As I said, I know it's partially just a character at this point, but I want to see them take the time to truly recreate a gourmet version of something. It just seems like Claire hits that wall by day two in a lot of recent episodes"
videos,"Yeah, and that's been a bit of a recent criticism too. They are choosing to try to recreate foods that are increasingly processed, with an emphasis on creating a copy as opposed to creating a gourmet version of the product. Because of that, they spend a lot more time focusing on the visual most recently, and they don't seem to be as gourmet in some of their ingredients or techniques. 

It's certainly no surprise that it's hard and frustrating, but more and more it seems like Claire comes into an episode ready to be frustrated, and she's frequently expressing that frustration by day 2 (Edit: like saying she doesn't want to come back another day , taking breaks between filming during a single episode, and wanting to cut some corner to finish sooner). 

Still a fan, still enjoying watching, but it's just a trend I've observed. It's a really great concept for the show and I want to see it continue"
videos,"I love Claire and enjoy Gourmet Makes so much, but man... More and more Claire seems to be putting on this persona of not enjoying and not wanting to be a part of the show. She doesn't ever want an episode to go longer than it needs to, and she's more willing to cut corners instead of perfecting her project. I can imagine some of it is basically a character at this point, but it kind of takes me out of it when she doesn't seem to want to be there.

They are truly the same song, and other Nickelback songs can be mashed up to a lesser degree. 

They wrote catchy songs at the height of this music, but as one of the later adopters, they also got crucified as the style faded from popularity and became predictable.

I certainly don’t hate them and I did find some of their stuff catchy, but they were a little ridiculous too.

Girls definitely do get injured in cheer, but those injuries are still reasonably rare (especially when compared to any other girl sport): https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/1/e20152447

>	Injury rates in cheerleading ranked 18th of 22 sports, with an overall injury rate of 0.71 per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). Competition (0.85) and practice (0.76) injury rates were similar, whereas performance rates were lower (0.49). Although 96.8% of injured cheerleaders were girls, the overall injury rate was higher in boys (1.33 vs 0.69, rate ratio [RR]: 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30–2.88). Although concussions were the most common cheerleading injury (31.1% of injuries), concussion rates were significantly lower in cheerleading (2.21 per 10 000 athlete-exposures) than all other sports combined (3.78; RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.51–0.66) and all other girls’ sports (2.70; RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72–0.93). 

Cheer can be awful for reasons you listed, but as your wife said, you are not only focusing on the possible negatives, you are fully exaggerating them to make your position sound more logical. You’re not an awful person for worrying about your daugther, but I don’t think this is the hill to die on. High school is only a 4 year journey and it doesn’t take much to sour that experience.

It was hard for me to see this guy on TV being hailed as a saint for his fight and his accomplishments while I watched my first NBA season without my dad.

1080 TI would be an awesome upgrade without a doubt, but it’s still a brutal price for something that isn’t new and will get “old” sooner (again, the price just doesn’t compute in my head, regardless of how ‘reasonable’ it might be in 2019). ~$500 was something I was barely able to justify for something ‘new’ and higher end, even though that was already $350 off what it should be. 

Basically I just need to get over it or not upgrade (so far I’m just not upgrading). I’m a stubborn consumer regardless of whether or not I can afford it, so it might not be until something breaks that I bite the bullet."

nba,"Here’s a good explanation of why there was immediate benefit from the Nets perspective. Without this, they would have had a harder time signing everyone. Everyone had to agree to it, so they all deserve some thanks. 

>https://twitter.com/AlbertNahmad

>Follow the next set of tweets very closely, to see how the Brooklyn Nets will employ salary cap magic on July 6, to squeeze an extra $9.2 million out of thin air!

>The common logic across the NBA community is the Nets did the Warriors a favor by agreeing to take in Kevin Durant via sign-and-trade, vs. simply signing him outright… That’s only half true! Yes, GSW extracted something: D’Angelo Russell. But so did Brooklyn: DeAndre Jordan!

>The Nets were probably planning to sign Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving into cap room. But when DeAndre Jordan became a possibility, they probably then shifted course. They decided to steal the Lakers’ idea!

>The Nets will brilliantly sequence their transactions, in order to increase the combined salary they can give to Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan by a whopping $9.2M… effectively creating cap room out of thin air to cover Jordan’s entire first-year salary!!!

>OK, so how are the Nets going to do it? Here are the steps:

nba,"I can’t wait to see how this plays out. 

An under-appreciated piece of this is Kerr, in my opinion. 

KD was absolutely incredible, but KD also played the game a little differently than Kerr drew up. 

This new team has lost some talent, but it’s a team of players who will all buy into the system completely, and I’m interested to see how that plays out. 

If Kerr orchestrates some serious success with these new pieces, he will certainly cement his coaching legacy (if he hasn’t already)."

news,"They are explaining the difference between equality and equity. 

Equality means giving everybody the same things, equity focuses on *increased* support in populations of need. 

A lot of educational legislation more recently has focused on equity. But equity never means hurting or removing support from any population to level the playing field. This person in the story has no idea what they are talking about when they bring up equity."
nba,"I’m a huge David Lee fan, and I give him a lot of credit being the real first ‘star’ that came and started us on our path.

He’d be on my personal retired jersey wall, that’s for sure."

Thank you Iguodala, I look forward to showing my grandchildren your jersey in the rafters."
nba,"I don’t disagree with you, but I won’t be upset if Livingston is also honored. Part of what made this team so special was the ‘strength in numbers’ mantra and the cohesiveness of the entire team, and it wouldn’t have been the same without Livingston. 

He definitely has the least stake in a jersey retirement, but I would have no problems seeing his jersey in the rafters when I go to games. This team was just so extraordinarily incredible and they aren’t likely to be overshadowed in Warriors history."
nba,"Livingston is the least guaranteed, but I could still see it. 

They are all a part of Warriors history forever and should be recognized. This is an unprecedented time for the team, and I feel like that’s what the jersey retirements are for."
nba,I wouldn’t have it any other way. Iguodala helped this team become what it is today and he will be a major part of Warriors history forever.
BuyItForLife,"I feel like the plastic nalgenes affect the taste of the water much quicker than I’d like. Double-walled hydro flasks don’t have that issue, unless you get the straw top (but even then, the straw stops affecting the water after some uses). Hydro flasks may dent over time, but it takes a lot to make them fail. The only bummer about dents is they bring the two walls of the bottle closer together, allowing for more heat to exchange (meaning they don’t insulate as well anymore). 

I have nalgenes from 15 years ago that still work great, and one that’s probably 25 years old. I have single-walled kleen canteens that are probably 10+ years old at this point and they still work fine. 

But I don’t use either of those anymore because I like the cold, fresh water that I get out of my hydro flask. I carry a 32 oz with a straw top with me every single day, and I drink more water than I ever have before.

Worst failure I’ve had is a broken straw lid, but hydro flask replaced it no questions asked. I had my first hydro flask stolen too, but they couldn’t help with that one. 

Overall, I like hydro flasks more all around, but I will still consider nalgenes to be one of the most durable water bottles out there."

There’s just no precedent for a return like that, even talking about an incredible athlete like Klay.  It would practically be a record recovery."

WhyWereTheyFilming,"How did you determine the BMW’s speed by this video? How would they verify that speed in court?

The only verifiable infraction in this video was the initial illegal turn made by the Prius. There is not a state in the US where that turn is legal, and ‘rear-ending = the rear-ender’s fault’ is not the law; it’s a general rule and not the outcome in all cases, such as when it is preceded by someone making an illegal maneuver. 

The Prius will be held at fault. 

The BMW should learn a thing or two about defensive driving, but with the video they should be clear with insurance."
WhyWereTheyFilming,"My drive home from work has a double right turn lane at one intersection, and I always take the left, outside right turn lane at that intersection because I make a left turn not to long after.

Its insane how much you have to look out for from people who consistently don’t obey the laws of the road."
WhyWereTheyFilming,"You only have to be 51% at fault for the insurance company to 100% blame you for an accident, in my experience.

It feels like they haven’t played Mother Superior live in a while, so it was awesome to see that again too (side story; right when the no world for tomorrow album came out I saw coheed a few days later, but I already had a crappy cellphone-recorded acoustic version of mother superior ahead of time so I knew all the words. I got front and center and was one of the only people in the crowd screaming the lyrics, and Claudio looked at me and laughed at one point. Good memories 😀). The band was having a good time, and Claudio even went full-on lead singer without the guitar for a couple of the new songs which was fun. I lost my voice singing and that’s usually a good sign. 

Good crowd, mastodon and every time I die played well (but the sound mixes weren’t great for mastodon, could only really hear drums and vocals), and we had a good time. 

But seriously, the driving and parking was pretty brutal. 1 lane over the golden gate for construction and the show started so early that there were still people parked in the garages from the workday, so they filled with concert goers really quick. I’m used to ~7:30 start times at the Masonic with no problems; the 6:30 start and 5:30 doors were a little rough. 

Probably more information than you wanted, but that’s how it went!"
TheFence,Parking was full 30 minutes before show start 😭
nba,"Very well written post, you deserved the gold. Good one to reference in the future."
mildlyinteresting,">	The fact that no one has done that leads me to believe there is some other factor involved (cost per bulb, quality of lighting, government regulation, etc.).

Yes, exactly. New bulbs are much cheaper to produce and purchase, are much brighter, and use significantly less electricity. 

There aren’t many benefits to an expensive, inefficient and dim bulb for the consumer or manufacturer. Even if it lasts a long time."
warriors,🤢🤮
assholedesign,It’s in the pre-pre game show before you start a game in my career (at least that’s where I saw it most recently)!
tifu,"Not sure how long it’s been since you got fitted for contacts, but I just got fitted for the first time in probably 10 years and I was really impressed by the number of ways they are able to customize the fit for contacts these days. They are able to control for different shaped eyes and different sized eyes and everything in between. 

I don’t know your specific situation obviously, but if it’s been a while I might recommend getting another consult! If the last optometrist you visited was behind the times, I might recommend a second opinion too!"
nba,"Yeah, this has to be a trick question. You can’t mention any backyard sports game and not give the GOAT title to Pablo Sanchez."
nba,Baze gonna Blaze
tifu,"You can, but then you have to deal with contacts. They don’t often last the whole day (your eyes start to tire out and dry out) and if they fall out for any reason then you’re out of luck.

They are temporary solutions, but nothing beats just... seeing, and being able to use those products normally."
warriors,"And typing over the entire image so that it can only be associated with their account and their take on the photo.

Just dumb attention-seeking behavior."
ConvenientCop,"If you haven’t heard, you should definitely listen to [the version they play these days.](https://youtu.be/B9z87viDmOo)

It’s beautiful and it really shows they still got it. There’s probably some auto-tune for Garfunkel these days, but I still love this rendition."

eldertrees,"In my experience, feeling foggy in the morning is directly related to how late I vape and how much I vape at that late hour. Giving yourself a cutoff time that’s earlier in the evening may reduce that effect in the morning."

Just brutal"
nba,"Sure, but this isn’t about Oakland PD. Dude was a County Sheriff"
videos,"Maybe, maybe not, it’s hard to tell. But the original videos he posted on his channel are him and a friend pretending to talk in that accent to each other. 

He does a GREAT job at it and I watch all his videos because they are hilarious and informative, but it isn’t a real accent unfortunately. 

Not that it matters much."
AskReddit,"Anyone with HBO should check out ‘Assume the Position’ with Robert Wuhl. He’s a great story teller and tells the story of Paul Revere’s ride and how it was eclipsed by others like Israel Bissel. 

The show is a funny and entertaining look at some American history stories, and I definitely recommend to those who are interested!"
hockey,Nine dollars *AND* fifty cents? Seriously absurd.
ConvenientCop,"That’s definitely unfortunate about the parallel parking, but I can understand it to a degree. 

They want to you pass a test and get your license, so they focus on teaching you the things that will come up in the test. Most places don’t test you on parallel parking, so it seems common that you don’t get a lesson on that with a driving instructor. 

The only reason I covered it with my instructor is because I asked to! It would be great if driving lessons were more thorough, but instead they are a great lesson in standardized testing; they lead to the prioritization of test preparation over actual teaching of a subject."
ConvenientCop,"In most places it’s minimum 2 people in the car, but there are stretches of highway in California that require 3."

videos,"Some cars will do this for you! I set my 2013 Honda civic to reset a trip meter every time I fill up, and it shows you fuel economy for that particular tank. Definitely used to do that in my old 1990 civic though. No gas light on that one so every tank was based on miles."
povertyfinance,"From what I can see, Amex is at 2.1% and Ally is at 2.2% APY. Ally is one of the best rates around at the current moment."
trashy,"It also speaks to the shit-iness of the packaging, that it could be so easily swapped. Not that the company is at fault here, but that seems like a good enough reason to rethink that design."
nba,"Did they partner for the actual production of the towels? That seems like a tall order, but definitely props to Oaklandish for the awesome design."
nba,Amen
MadeMeSmile,"Right there with you. 

Would give anything to spend some time with him again."
freefolk,"It was an hour of convenient conversation and interaction between characters that either haven’t met before or haven’t had a conversation in a long time. 

Even in the moment, it felt like fan service and a pretty stagnant plot. But after seeing the following episodes you realize it wasn’t even setting up much for the end plot. 

Definitely didn’t understand the love for that episode."

BuyItForLife,"Just bought my first pair of red wing shoes a few months ago and I’m very impressed! They are holding up well to wear and I’m impressed with their customer service as well. 

They told me I could get my shoes shined for free at any time after I purchased them, but I’ve been waiting to take them up on that offer. My shoes started showing some wear and some of my shoelaces started to fray, so I went by the store to get a shine and to purchase new laces. They helped me right away, and also informed me that shoelace replacements are free as well! I sat there for a few minutes, and then I was out the door with shined shoes and new laces threaded for $0.

Definitely recommend!"
nba,"There’s nothing wrong with the bandwagon, in general. People love watching good teams win games, and that’s good for the sport. 

But there’s a huge problem with shitty people, and they certainly come out with the bandwagon. 

Fuck shitty people."
