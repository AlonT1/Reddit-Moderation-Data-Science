politics,"> **Electoral votes counted in Congress.**

> Members of the House and the Senate will meet in the House chamber. The President of the Senate -- that's Vice President Mike Pence -- will preside over the session and the electoral votes will be read and counted in alphabetical order by two appointees each from the House and Senate. They will then give their tallies to Pence, who will announce the results and listen for objections.

> If there are objections, the House and Senate consider them separately to decide how to count those votes.

> There are 538 electoral votes -- one for each congressman and senator plus three for Washington, DC. If no candidate gets to a majority -- that's 270 -- then the 435 members of the House decide the election. Each state gets a vote. So while there are more Democrats in the House, Republicans, as of now, control more state delegations, so it is possible the House could pick Donald Trump even though there is a Democratic majority.

> The House has until noon on January 20 to pick the President. If they can't, it would be the vice president or the next person eligible in the line of presidential succession."

politics,"> President Trump’s cynical effort to enlist the courts in his attempt to retain power has failed miserably. Claims of voter fraud and other theories advanced on his behalf have consistently been rebuffed by judges of all political backgrounds, including judges with conservative reputations and federal judges appointed by Republican presidents — including Trump himself. While there are still a handful of cases pending, it is the consensus among lawyers and legal scholars that they are at best on tenuous life support.

> With two months until the inauguration and a president desperate to stay in power, the attempt to subvert the election is not over. But if our democracy survives the current president’s onslaughts, it will be due in large part to the existence of a judiciary committed to the rule of law."

politics,"We never punish a user for reporting a rule-breaking comment/account. In fact, we can't see which user submitted the report. But as described above, we do not permit calling out other users in the comments.

We do review the user's history in addition to the comment. You can write a free-form report rather than selecting one of the current options by clicking ""Other"" and then typing in the field."
politics,"Our civility rule is based in the fact that comments that target other user accounts rather than the arguments they have written only serves to devolve the conversation. Name calling, ad-hominem, demeaning, inflammatory, or other uncivil comments directed at other users are not allowed.

This includes calling others a ""troll,"" ""shill,"" ""bot,"" or ""not genuine."" We know how frustrating it is to see other users violating the rules. Please report (using the report button) any users/posts/comments you believe are breaking the rules. That will add them to our queue for review, which we work hard to review as quickly as possible.

But when users start using these terms as accusations, it derails the conversation, thus leading to further toxicity. This also increases moderator workload, thus slowing down our ability to respond to other reports. The best way you can help us tackle this problem is to report such comments and move on."

politics,"> Baker is expected to release details of the plan as early as next week, building off the recommendations of a working group he quietly created last year to study the issue, according to those involved in the process. It comes as House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo committed late Wednesday to wide-ranging legislation that, among other things, would abolish the police’s use of chokeholds and create an independent office to “ensure” enhanced training and police certification.

> The idea of licensing officers through a so-called Peace Officer Standards and Training, or POST, system has gained new prominence amid intensifying scrutiny of police brutality and tactics following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody."
politics,"> Now the unlikeliest of political allies, US Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Justin Amash of Michigan, a former Republican turned Independent with a strong libertarian bent, are united in an effort to roll back the judicially driven doctrine with an actual statute to limit its use in police cases.

> “Under qualified immunity, police are immune from liability unless the person whose rights they violated can show that there is a previous case in the same jurisdiction, involving the exact same facts, in which a court deemed the actions to be a constitutional violation,” Amash and Pressley said in a letter to their congressional colleagues. “This rule has sharply narrowed the situations in which police can be held liable — even for truly heinous rights violations — and it creates a disincentive to bringing cases in the first place.”

> This is a unique moment — a moment when the consciences of lawmakers should spur them to act to protect all citizens, but particularly Black Americans who have so grievously suffered at the hands of law enforcement. Ending the doctrine of qualified immunity won’t by itself end abuses, but it will help restore balance in a legal system that has been thrown perilously off kilter."

politics,I really hoped Baker had more sense than this. Massachusetts is one of the hardest-hit states right now. May 18 is far too soon.

politics,Whose popularity is growing? Note that this is data from just one state.
cats,"The governor has told people to stay at home. So I guess not technically the tight term, but it sure feels the same. I haven’t left my apartment in three weeks except for to attend a medical appointment."
politics,"> But here’s the twist: because of a number of states have pushed back their primary contests hoping to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, Biden won’t technically be the presumptive Democratic nominee — with a majority of pledged delegates — for a very long time.

> The most popular date that states have moved presidential primaries to seems to be June 2. That date suddenly now will award more delegates in a single day all year except for Super Tuesday, March 3, when 14 states voted, including California.

> In all, 636 delegates will be up for grabs on June 2. It is a number that could grow should more states decide to postpone their primaries to dates in June, the last possible month to hold a contest under the current Democratic National Committee rules. (The Democratic National Convention is scheduled for July, but if it actually happens is in doubt.)"
