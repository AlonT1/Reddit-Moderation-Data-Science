RandomActsOfChristmas,This is a very thoughtful contest and I have no doubt the Santa’s appreciate it.
RandomActsOfChristmas,"You may not see it on the app, it appears on the web page though!"
CrohnsDisease,"Aw, man. I hope sooner rather than later."
CrohnsDisease,"I haven’t tried it personally but it’s mentioned quite often within the subreddit, often stating it provides relief. Obviously everyone is different but I’ve seen a lot of positive comments regarding CBD oil usage."
CrohnsDisease,Is there an ETA as to when you guys will get it?
CrohnsDisease,"Usually helpful is recognizing patterns, things to avoid.  Stress is my biggest factor (I think it's most peoples) but it's also helpful for me to track my food, sleep schedule, hydration, just to see if something changed, when/why/where if I start flaring instead of trying to guess."
CrohnsDisease,"Did they do any blood work on you recently?  Would be able to help tell if/what vitamin deficiencies you may have.  As far as not having any other symptoms than needing to use the restroom more, I'd make a food and bathroom journal.  Simply to keep track of what you eat, when you use the restroom, and what kind of bowel movements you have, to further narrow down any trigger foods for you.  You can add whatever other types of data you'd like such as stressors, mood, etc."
CrohnsDisease,There was a post about this a few weeks ago [here](https://redd.it/k3u568) which doesn't quite answer your question but I'm curious if /u/Nawigi had any similar experiences.
CrohnsDisease,"I do have a nutritionist and think they're helpful since the disease is very different between every person.  You'll find commonalities between people which can provide a lot of comfort, but certain dietary guidelines that may work for you won't work for me and vice versa.  

Biggest word of advice is to remember to be your own advocate.  If you have questions or are unsure if anything, ask.  Follow-up with your doctors, send notes on the portal, or give them a call if you have some concerns if something is abnormal.  Over time, you'll eventually learn more about what's [the new] normal for your body, however, you still ultimately know your body best.

Feel free to stop by [our discord](https://discord.gg/g2gcwb6) if you'd every like to chat!"
RandomActsOfChristmas,Happy to help answer any questions.  Would you like us to send you a message via modmail?
femalefashionadvice,Adding in another vote for Eddie Bauer fleece lined pants.  They're comfortable and warm.

RandomActsOfChristmas,You got it!
RandomActsOfChristmas,"Hello there! It looks like you have played Santa for someone! Thank you so much.

If you haven't already, please [fill out a Santa Report](https://raochristmas.com/report-santa/).  We use the gift tallies to keep things fair, and also to celebrate at the end of the season!

If you need help with the form, please [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandomActsOfChristmas), and if you have already recorded this gift, thank you! :D"
CrohnsDisease,"Stress is always the first and biggest issue.  

Not quite as easy to do with work, but I have no issues disappearing from social avenues if they're contributing any stress.  The people that will know you will understand why you're gone, and the others likely don't matter."
femalefashionadvice,"If I'm comparing them to the minnetonka's, those literally split in the toe box after two wears.  Thought perhaps it was a fluke, so I just exchanged them but the second pair did the same thing.  I don't have wide feet and they fit fine, but I felt the quality was subpar.  

I tried to find the pair from anthropologie but they're a few years old and long gone from the site.  These are ankle-height and have faux shearling lining.  They're cute in the anthro-fashion way, but aren't warm at all, provide no traction what-so-ever, and provide no actual footbed support.

Onto my new loves, the LL Beans!  They're actually warm.  The Ugg (I have Dakotas) are also warm, but these come up higher on my foot.  Simply provide more coverage.  The footbed is cushioning and I don't think the fur is obnoxious in the footbed.  From that standpoint, the same can the said about Uggs.  Last and certainly not least, for a super clumsy person such as myself, I don't slide around in them!  The outsole actually provides traction!

*edit: typo"
femalefashionadvice,"They don't leave my feet!  Initially, I felt they would be a silly purchase.  I've tried all of these other slippers people loved: minnetonka, anthropologie (no clue on the brand name), ugg.  They'd go back into my closet and I'd forget about them.  I haven't stopped wearing the LL Bean slippers since they've arrived."
femalefashionadvice,They’re just so good!
CrohnsDisease,Congratulations!
CrohnsDisease,"Yes.

I think part of accepting that you're asking for helping during a flare-up is kind of going through accepting a different stage of the disease.  You go through stages [of grief] when you're diagnosed, but kind of the stages all over again when you're flaring and losing parts of your independence."
CrohnsDisease,I think being on the proper type of antibiotics for whatever bacteria is infecting you is important.  Swabs for cultures are typically painless and helpful with providing exactly what bacteria is causing the infection.  May also decrease the number of times you'd have to be on antibiotics in general.
femalefashionadvice,Crawlers?
femalefashionadvice,"* LL Bean Wicked Good slippers. 
* Smartwool socks.
* Turtlefur beanie.
* Gap Purebody joggers."
femalefashionadvice,I bought these a few weeks ago and they’ve barely left my feet.  Love them.
femalefashionadvice,You may also want to check out [this](https://redd.it/jovt5i) thread.
CrohnsDisease,Stay well and hope you get the results you're hoping for!
CrohnsDisease,"Major pain in my knees, hips, and lower back.  I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis shortly after my diagnosis but overall, joint pain isn't uncommon with IBD."
CrohnsDisease,"Barium any day.  CT contrast made me super sick for several days, it was like drinking prep."
CrohnsDisease,Unexpectedly super sick after drinking this.  Didn't stop for days.
femalefashionadvice,"Every major season change I clean out my closet and donate whatever I didn't wear, don't think I'll wear, etc.  It's awfully strange to do that during a pandemic.  ""I haven't worn this in 6-months but ... covid?"""
femalefashionadvice,"I wanted to get excited about clothing and fashion so I did the same.  Then I realized majority of my outfits currently include joggers, cozy socks, slippers, and some type of warm but zoom-presentable top."
RandomActsOfChristmas,"Hi there!

Similar to what the message says, we ask all Santas that visit and help spread cheer throughout the season to please fill out a report.  This helps as a way to verify purchases, track orders if there are any shipping issues, and ensure there's no bad-faith within the subreddit.  If you have any questions please feel free to let us know."
femalefashionadvice,Now I'm not going to get this song out of my head for the rest of the day.

femalefashionadvice,"Local shelters, especially women’s rescue shelters.

North Face gives vouchers ($10 I think?).  Not a discount but Nike offers recycling for shoes."
femalefashionadvice,"Gap Pure Body.  They’re comfortable and I’ve found they hold their shape. With that said, if it’s 35F outside, I’m not wearing them for a stroll in the neighborhood."
femalefashionadvice,Blue specifically?  [Banana Republic](https://bananarepublicfactory.gapfactory.com/browse/product.do?pid=595324) has a similar one on a pretty great sale.
femalefashionadvice,"I have 500s and [584s](https://www.blundstone.com/rustic-brown-premium-waterproof-leather-chelsea-boots-womens-style-584).  Wore the 584s in snow in Boston, didn't get hurt, nor did my feet freeze."
femalefashionadvice,Two faves are BDG and Gap Slim-Straight.
femalefashionadvice,Around the house I just wear [Field and Stream Hiking Socks](https://www.fieldandstreamshop.com/p/field-stream-merino-hiker-hiking-socks-2-pack-15fnsufsmrnhkr2pkapa/15fnsufsmrnhkr2pkapa?Product=ProductSuggest).  $15 for two pairs of wool socks to keep my feet warm.

RandomActsOfChristmas,"Hi there,

Thanks for coming to our subreddit to host this.  It looks like you're hosting a [Contest] or a [Giveaway].  If you have any questions, please feel free to [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandomActsOfChristmas)."
femalefashionadvice,Yep.  ['07](https://www.nike.com/t/air-force-1-07-mens-shoe-TjqcX1).
femalefashionadvice,They're also having a sale right now with code 'gusty'!
femalefashionadvice,"Pact?

Their prices vary on style but usually $9-$12 a pair, organic cotton.  Comes in nude and other colors.  No tags, usually smooth under clothes.

Most of the specific 'no show' options I can think of off-hand are some type of poly/elastane/spandex blend that just have a cotton gusset."
femalefashionadvice,"I wear [smartwool] cabin socks most often when I wear mine.  They stick up a little bit, but not too much.  Smartwool also provides sizing for their socks which I prefer for a similar reason you mentioned.  I don't like wearing socks that don't fit properly, having excess sock hanging around in my shoe, or around my ankle."
politics,Nice.

femalefashionadvice,"Gap Pure Body Joggers.

Just purchased [this](https://www.ae.com/us/en/p/women/hoodies-sweatshirts/aerie-hoodies-sweatshirts/offline-ott-fleece-hoodie/2164_2040_317) aerie offline hoodie, which is so silly soft it blows my mind."
femalefashionadvice,This is how I fold my 'throw around' t-shirts.  My 'fancier' t-shirts I hang.
femalefashionadvice,"They're leggings but I have a pair from Under Armor that are warm and comfortable around my abdomen.  I have Crohns and had major GI surgery last year, these pass my comfort test but obviously every one different."
femalefashionadvice,I would keep your eye [here](https://www.shopyourtv.com/undoing/).
femalefashionadvice,First learned about them from my PT and haven't looked back since!
femalefashionadvice,I wear Superfeet (green) but the color preference really depends on your feet and specific needs.  You can try their [insole quiz](https://www.superfeet.com/en-us/insole-fit-finder) to find your color.  REI usually has them to try in-store but COVID likely changed that.
femalefashionadvice,"If the bras are properly fit then it can be how the bras are being laundered.  If they aren't be washed by hand or in a laundry bag for bras, the cups can be getting damaged in the wash.  That can be what's causing the edge to show under clothing."
femalefashionadvice,"Blundstones are a fave.

Similar to what /u/TheApiary said, I have a pair of Uggs that are the waterproof leather boots.  No one ever knows they're Uggs.  Super warm, keep my feet dry, and I can wear them with almost anything."
femalefashionadvice,Also going to plug in [weekly dealz](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/ilvjrb/weekly_dealz/) hosted by /u/_spiraling.
