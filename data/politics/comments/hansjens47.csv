For the most upvoted posts of the year, why do I get a different list when [looking at the listing](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/top/?t=year) of the most upvoted posts this year?

Specifically, [The post about Joe Biden being elected president](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/jptqj9/joe_biden_elected_president_of_the_united_states/) seems to have gotten 348,000 upvotes, yet isn't there.

The post of [leaked drone footage of shackled and blindfolded Uighur Muslims led from trains.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/hrpgzt/leaked_drone_footage_of_shackled_and_blindfolded/) that got over 262,000 upvotes also seems to be missing."
ModSupport,"There are (or at least used to be) domains that were prevented from being submitted as submissions in the past. You'd simply get an error message explaining that you couldn't submit from that domain and a short reason why.

You should use those. Prevention is way better than removal as feedback to those who're submitting something. 
([example from 6 years ago in a thread about the other admin domain bans](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/28d487/meta_the_reddit_admins_employees_automatically/))

This is extreme indifference used exactly the way I suggested above.

We get a huge volume of these comments that are in fact just another way of wishing harm on others. That's the vast majority of what comments like these are used to convey."
politics,"I am not aware of anyone who holds ""fascist"" political views on the mod team.

We hold a variety of different views. 

We don't have quotas or select people to join the team based on their political views. That's not important for how people actually end up moderating anyway"
politics,"If you're calling someone you deem to be acting in bad faith names, insult them while they're being civil, but spewing nonsense, don't you think a low-information onlooker might think you're in the wrong, not the person you deem to be acting in bad faith as a troll?

Tone and language matters. Reddit has an effective voting system for minimizing the exposure of low-score comments and submissions.

If you choose to engage with someone you believe is a troll (risking that their content therefore gets more exposure), providing fact that they're wrong is often the way to change minds of third parties reading the conversation."
politics,"I'm sorry we didn't approve that comment earlier.

Automoderator gets rid of a bunch of meta-comments about the running of /r/politics that'd be completely out of place in a discussion about actual US politics.

That obviously isn't ideal for a meta-thread where those comments are perfectly on-topic."
politics,"""he literally posted that on his twitter **you muppet**""

As you point out, it's the insult at the end there. We're hard on insults irrespective of context because they're a surefire way of having internet fights break out in the comments.

---

We're also in a strange political situation where major political views don't agree on basic facts, or interpretations of said facts that were universal foundations of politics previously.

That makes it very hard to identify a lot of people who'd previously obviously be trolls, but now very well may sincerely believe those things.

I get that it's not very satisfactory when you don't believe someone is acting in good faith and don't see those comments removed. It's hard to tell and simply silencing people would do more harm than good (this goes for views all over the political spectrum)"
politics,"Mods have a variety of political views. When reviewing how different moderators moderate in blind tests, I am unable to distinguish their political views from how they moderate.

I can only speak to the moderation since I joined the team in 2013, but at least since then, a number of people from all parts of the political spectrum deem the moderation team to hold political views based on us not disallowing ____ political view be posted, either as submissions or as comments.

(As an observation, it's my experience that a large majority of those who share such views seem to think we always target their political views, irrespective of what views they hold.)"
politics,"Saying something like ""Who in their right mind cares that x got covid"" or ""I wouldn't care if x had a stroke"" or similar is basically just another way of saying "" I hope harm befalls x""

That's what we imply by 'extreme indifference', it's basically just other ways of letting everyone know how x deserves harm in someone's view.

---

If you're just indifferent to the situation, like you're commenting on something else entirely that's fine. It's not like we ever require people to say something similar to "" I hope x gets well soon, but I disagree with their policy/belief on this issue"". You can just talk about the issue.

----

We try to make our rules unambiguous and clear cut without complicated exceptions because there are more than enough rules and complexities to think about. Hopefully the totality of rules just amounts to ""as long as I'm showing basic decency, I won't ever have to worry about reading the rules"".

In my view, that's probably not exactly how it feels to some. It's not like we want muddy, unclear rules that feels like they're hard to understand. At the same time, we don't want a huge codified volume of rules that feels impenetrable.

I hope this helps clarify things. Feel free to ask more follow ups if needed."
politics,"In addition to the other response, of course you can always say something like:

>you'd want them punished to the full extent of the law for any crimes you deem them to be culpable for. 

That's very different to, say, suggest that someone should be executed, although they may in very narrowly defined criminal circumstances may amount to exactly the same thing. 

Words and how one says something matters."
politics,"In this very comment you've done so, and I believe gotten that point across clearly.

Of course you can acknowledge how you feel about the administration, how roles were swapped.

Of course you can lay blame wherever you wish.

The only thing the death and violence policy requires is that you do so (as you have) in a way that doesn't wish harm on others. That doesn't disallow holding anyone to account."
politics,"Adding to the other comment in response, we catch a lot more, and have fewer false positives.

With the volume of comments having increased so much, likely things might look similar to users. The nature of automated moderation is of course removing things before users will ever see them. You can't see something that isn't there."
politics,"Things have substantially changed since I started modding the sub in 2013. /r/politics doesn't exist in a vacuum.

All of social media has changed substantially (also since 2016). 

US politics has changed substantially.

Reddit and ""reddit culture"" has changed substantially.

Trolling has changed substantially.

---

Looking at the stuff we automatically remove, certainly our tools for killing trolling before it ever goes public has improved.

Personally, I believe trolls are harder to identify now than they were prior to the last election as people acting in bad faith have gotten a lot better at looking like normal users. 

When people of different political persuasions can't agree on basic facts, it's a lot harder to identify who's being sincere and who's just doing it to pull others' legs, or worse to try to manipulate people."
politics,"Personally, I believe the same things will always be hard:

* speed of moderation (which is an important quality for both discussions and submissions)
* Consistency, and showing that we spend a ton of time on treating everyone the same
* getting around to as much content as possible
* explaining our thought process so people understand

And all the while showing that we do take feedback seriously and try to adapt how we moderate. We know the sub isn't perfect, the moderation isn't either, but we constantly attempt to strike a balance between consistency and clear, rigid, predictable rules and getting things right for all sorts of political submissions and comments.

----

**Edit:** Additionally, I think one of the most problematic things on reddit in general is that we don't really have tools to get rid of things that are off-topic in a specific thread in a meaningful way. Some things are just regurgitated everywhere although they don't have anything to do with the topic at hand. 

I really wish we had some sort of tools to deal with that. Now we leave those things up, because just silencing all those conversations would be doing even more harm, but it's not a great situation."
politics,"There are thousands of new users, or people who don't regularly interact with /r/politics in the comment sections for the very first time every day.

Sadly we cannot reach only them, not the regulars with these sorts of messages.

So far it does indeed seem they're only showing admin-actions for every quarter, not mod actions. 

So essentially the disclosure is worse than nothing. Mods perform so many more moderation actions than admins that the admin figures give a completely misleading report of the moderation that takes place at scale on the site."
announcements,"I have three questions about wording of the new rule:

**1. How are you going to define my ""actual race"" as opposed to my perceived race?**

**2. Why does reddit protect people based on religion, but not creed or other guiding ideology?**

**3. Why has reddit determined that it's okay to harass, bully and give threats of violence towards people in the ""majority"" (whatever that means in context)?**

----

Here are the relevant parts of [the new rule](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or) that relate to my three questions:

>Marginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, **groups based on their actual and perceived race**, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families. 

further:

>While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, **the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority** or who promote such attacks of hate. 


-----

Who did you guys run the text of this new rule by?

Maybe it would have been an idea to run this new rule by reddit to crowdsource feedback more to address some of these issues instead of having this discussion drown in conversations about what subreddits were banned and not."
announcements,"Two years ago a [study of 100 million reddit comments and subimissions](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf) showed that banning hate communities work. It was based on data from 2015.

**Why wasn't this followed by action from reddit years ago?**

Here's what the study found in short:

>In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits—foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown—due to
violations of Reddit’s anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach
remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts
of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating
users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech
lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked
for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased
their hate speech usage—by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and
r/CoonTown “migrants,” those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words,
other subreddits did not inherit the problem.

In 2018 he wrote a [clear opinion piece](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/extremism-pays-why-silicon-valley-not-shutting-it-down-youtube) on how you, reddit, as a social media site, profit off hosting extremism.

Naughton wrote:

>Watching social media executives trying to square this circle is like watching worms squirming on the head of a pin. The latest hapless exhibit is YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, who went to the South by Southwest conference in Texas last week to outline measures intended to curb the spread of misinformation on her platform. This will be achieved, apparently, by showing – alongside conspiracy-theory videos, for example – “additional information cues, including a text box linking to third-party sources [about] widely accepted events, like the moon landing”. It seems that the source of these magical text boxes will be Wikipedia.

Reddit isn't doing even that. Reddit is guaranteeing echo chambers of junk content who in many cases **actively ban** dissent or dissenting voices. 

**Why does reddit quarantine any community for any extended amount of time?** If it's harmful, give a short chance to get things right, if that isn't done, ban.

Danah Boyd says, very acutely:

>Over the last 25 years, the tech industry has held steadfast to its commitment to creating new pathways for people who historically have not had access to the tools of scaled communication. Yet, at this very moment, those who built these tools and imagined letting a thousand flowers bloom are stepping back and wondering: what hath we wrought? Like the ACLU and other staunch free speech advocates, we all recognized that we would need to accept a certain amount of ugly speech. But never in their wildest imaginations did the creators of major social media realize that their tools of amplification would be weaponized to radicalize people towards extremism, gaslight publics, or serve as vehicles of cruel harassment.

Every developed country in the world has some form of law on the books against hate speech *except the United States*. There are tonnes of legally practiced, clear, objective definitions with decades of jurisprudence to take from.

1. Has reddit looked at hate speech law across the world to draw inspiration in how a ban on hate speech should be made on the site?

2. If you have, why has it taken years and nothing has happened, but now the timeline is suddenly ""weeks not months?""

3. If you haven't, why in the world not?

**Why has it taken years for reddit to do the things all other major social media platforms have done to curb the most basic forms of hate speech and intimidation intended to scare minority voices of all kinds away from using the platform?**

Quarantined communities don't get ads. They're effectively subsidized by the rest of reddit. all of reddit is paying to host its worst communities.

Further, as mods we have no way of doing anything about the problem that you've articulated in this bug thread. If there is indeed a bug with the android app, you'd have to get help from the admins (reddit employees).

This seems like a feature of the android mobile app, and although it's a bad/unwanted feature, it's probably not a bug. To change the hearts and minds of the people that run the site, you're going to need to participate in a way that'll make them interested in listening to you and changing their minds."

It also seems very reasonable to be able to disable the feature entirely (like through a checkbox in the subreddit settings)"

bugs,"Hi there!

This isn't a bug. It's part of a 

[beta test](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/b0a8he/detecting_and_mitigating_content_manipulation_on/) the admins (reddit employees) are running. 

>Some of our more recent efforts have focused on reducing community interference (ie “brigading”). This includes efforts to mitigate (in real-time) vote brigading, targeted sabotage (Community A attempting to hijack the conversation in Community B), and general shitheadery. Recently we have been developing additional advanced mitigation capabilities. In the past 3 months we have reduced successful brigading in real-time by 50%. We are working with mods on further improvements and continue to beta test additional community tools (such as an ability to auto-collapse comments by users, which is being tested with a small number of communities for feedback).

I agree with you that their solution for the problem doesn't seem like a good one."
blog,"The volume combined with reddit's API is precisely why it'd be so awesome to have /r/chillingeffects be used. 

It would be a powerful tool for reporting on, learning about and shaming those who misuse or abuse DMCA requests systematically. "
ideasfortheadmins,"So you want spam-overridden mirrors of thousands of communities all filled with commenting bots, and content that's close to, but just barely doesn't breach reddit's sitewide rules?

And you want this place to be curated how? Where does all the stuff that's removed from the removed subreddits go? Who ensures this isn't a place of just-barely-not-harassment and borderline fighting words, almost sexualized minors and so on?

It seems to me you'd be much better off creating those communities you want yourself, and see how well they fare.

I don't expect people are interested in spending time in reddit's discard piles. You have all the tools to prove me wrong."
changelog,">Quick question: Do these usually come in big batches, or just one-off abusive reports?

Both.

Every high-profile submission in /r/politics gets at least 10 completely spurious and false reports. Many get vastly more.

It's the same for comments. Some seem to use the report option as a ""superdisagree button"" when the downvote for sharing the ""wrong"" opinion isn't enough.

We also see waves where people seemingly go down a listing in the subreddit to report every submission or comment.

----

We get on the order of thousands of completely wrong reports from people who just want to show their outrage in various ways *every single day.*

This has been going on for years and years.

If any of the current admins moderated large subreddits actively, they'd see how crazy it is this isn't being dealt with. Think of the time-waste that could be avoided through an anonymized system to filter out mass-reporters, serial wrong-reporters or both.

We could spend all that time actually moderating content that needs to be looked at instead of sifting through modqueues where silly proportions of the reported content doesn't break any rule, the site, doesn't threaten, harass or all the other things reddit would be better off if we could see quickly."
TheoryOfReddit,"/r/politicalhumor like /r/funny don't have a real on-topic statement. That's why there aren't attempts at humor.

* /r/funny's rules require an attempt at humor in each submission. Without a definition of humor (there's a *ton* of literature on this) that becomes too weak a requirement and the mods don't remove enough non-humor.

* /r/politicalhumor requires that submissions ""try to be funny"". However, the mods say right out that they get to judge whether something is funny or not. Their sense of humor must be of that guy who laughs at every bad joke, and things that aren't even jokes.

Consequently both these subreddits are easy to abuse with non-funny content that you know will get votes. If it gets votes, the community *must* be saying this is funny and on topic, right?

-----

I personally don't find /r/jokes to be funny that often. However, I can easily see that the posts there *are jokes*. Every single one of them. That leads me to believe that the moderators remove a lot of things that just aren't jokes like any funny subreddit would have to remove things that aren't attempts at humor or are attempts at humor that aren't funny, but pandering.

I don't think it's a coincidence that the subreddit disallows the lowest-effort content: image/gif submissions and memes.

Even so, what /r/jokes suggests is a [long] joke is generally something consumed in around a minute.

----

With regard to the political portion of politics:

Redditors build the political communities they want to see. Some moderation teams ban and remove stuff that doesn't have the right views.

Many of the others also have clear partisan leanings although the *moderation* doesn't reinforce that, the users and their voting patterns do. Example: there are no rules against conservative submissions or conservative opinions in /r/politics, but the users consistently ensure those views don't get exposure in the submissions or in the comments through their voting, not because of the moderation team.

Since /r/politics and other large political subreddits that allow left-leaning views generally remove soap-boxing posts and have rules against those, or don't allow self-posts or user-generated content,  my hypothesis is that /r/politicalhumor acts as a sort of catch-all for those posts.

-----

As non-humorous posts are left to stand, more and more people pile on without any intention of being funny, but sticking it to those with the ""wrong"" political views. 

The actual attempts at humor drown in pushing your political issues and getting them exposure. Proselytizing is the *aim* of a lot of political posting on all social media. Yelling at people with the wrong views or ""getting"" them is another strong  incentive to spend time on politics online.

Those actions are huge drivers in pushing away those who might actually be receptive to political posts from wanting to engage with political content online at all, ever."
ModSupport,"This is correct.

Votes from banned users don't count. "
TheoryOfReddit,"It's very dependent on what subreddit you're in.

I previously moderated a large video-game related subreddit, and smaller subreddits. Right now I moderate one subreddit.

The volume and make-up of rule-breaking submissions varies a lot based on the subreddits. 

Some places get a lot of spam that can be automatically removed. Others get a lot of user-submitted posts that don't belong in the community. Some don't get many submissions at all, and almost all are topical. 

The size of subreddits and their activity also matter, and what type of users the sub caters to."
TheoryOfReddit,"No, no they don't read rules and guidelines.

That's at least what they say in modmail when we remove rule-breaking posts and comments.

-----

Second to that, there's a large group of people who on removal of their contributions say they didn't understand the rules.

For example, a common occurrence is calling another user a bunch of names, then saying they didn't think that was against a rule on personal attacks."
TheoryOfReddit,"Exactly right.

What a lot of people forget though (and why some instagram photos get redistributed around on other sites without asking users for permission) are that there are exceptions to copyright protection in most countries.

-----

Pictures may be used in those exception cases. Some places that's for almost any personal non-commercial use, other places carve out exceptions for various definitions of newsworthiness, adaptations or remixes and many other things."
TheoryOfReddit,"Or use said content in say, a book of AMA questions and their responses, without having to contact or gain approval from those they're quoting.

-----

Reddit has historically been relatively restrictive in its use of the insanely overly wide rights they require redditors to grant for using the site, but that's entirely up to the company. 

Reddit asks for *a lot* more than it needs to function, and I wouldn't be surprised if in the quest for growth and monetization, reddit may opt to use more of the rights we all grant them in time."
modnews,"The admin-run and unmoderated /r/beta is full of spam. See /r/beta/new.

Reddit requires that all subreddits have ""*a stable and active team of moderators.*""

When will you start moderating your own subreddits to remove the most obvious spam?"
politics,This would be *incredibly* helpful.
modnews,"Only a tiny minority of the ~400 people working at reddit did so two years ago. The turnover has been near complete.

That's why it's both so important that those of us with years and years of continuity on the site keep suggesting the same common sense fixes that were just as sensible 5 years ago.

And also why it's so important for the admins to reach out to folks running reddit's communities from day to day for years. The earlier in the pipeline, the better. That's gotta be some of the most efficient time admins can spend in the development of site tools."
TheoryOfReddit,"Makes sense. 

There's a lot of  40 20 20 20 and 34 17 17 17 spreads from users that have 5 and 6 comments in their histories. When they're evenly matched (which happens quite regularly) subreddit grouping or exotic subreddits become even more determining."
TheoryOfReddit,"So far, it seems like I'm getting things ""wrong"" in several circumstances:

* When two or more subreddits essentially about the same topic combine to a higher percentage than a single default subreddit.
* when I say someone who comments 80% in askreddit is less specialized than someone who comments 70% in say askcarsales
* when I say someone who comments say 50% in a specialized subreddit about bikes or whatever is more specialized than someone who posts 70% in askreddit and the rest of the 30% spread among other defaults


Are things ""correct"" based on user-answers or some formula?

If it's user answers, I think the bias to just quickly click based on the size of the first (and possibly second) bar graph will make these results pretty useless. "

announcements,"I was expecting "" talking to shareholders and potential shareholders"" to be at the top of this list."
TheoryOfReddit,"Like mods. 

15% of points to the mods just seems like it's a *lot*."
TheoryOfReddit,"This is often how a discussion on hate speech in social media stops: asking for a definition and then bickering over definitions instead of discussing whether hate speech should be allowed on social media or not.

The US is the only developed country in the world that doesn't have some form of anti-hate speech law on the books.

It's not like hate speech is substantially different from defining fighting words, incitement to violence, or libel, or state secrets or all the other types of speech that are already disallowed.

----

The discussion often turns into questions over *specific* definitions of hate speech rather than whether or not hate speech should be banned.

It's natural that we have a failure of imagination and simply can't envision that something so seemly difficult to pin down as hate speech often seems, in a legal context is much easier to define that the whole ""I know it when I see it"" definition of pornography.

-----

I'm not suggesting that you're one of the people who'd love to derail discussions about disallowing hate speech by always reverting to a discussion on definitions of hate speech so we never get to the original question.

But, there seem to be a lot of people that do exactly that, on purpose. 

Why can't we just posit that we'll find a sensible definition among the many that have decades of jurisprudence on the books in different European countries?  Then we can have the discussion on whether or not hate speech should be allowed on social media.

Finding a definition isn't a problem. The principle is what matters.

-----

 To me it's pretty obvious that those who'd prioritize hate speech systematically used and intended as ways of scaring specifics group into silence *instead* of letting those people feel safe participating have a poor argument.

It's no wonder they often want to deflect and talk of how to define hat speech instead."
politics,"We've taken out *many*. You only see the ones that slip through.

It's awesome if you keep reporting them with descriptive report reasons. :)"
announcements,"Last year, a [study of 100 million reddit comments and subimissions](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf) showed that banning hate communities work.

Here's what they found in short:

>In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits—foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown—due to
violations of Reddit’s anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach
remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts
of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating
users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech
lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked
for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased
their hate speech usage—by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and
r/CoonTown “migrants,” those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words,
other subreddits did not inherit the problem.

John Naughton is professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University. earlier this year he wrote a [clear opinion piece](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/extremism-pays-why-silicon-valley-not-shutting-it-down-youtube) on how you, reddit, as a social media site, profit off hosting extremism.

>The tech giants’ need for ‘engagement’ to keep revenues flowing means they are loath to stop driving viewers to ever-more unsavoury content

You're dressing up shit instead of banning it, even though you **know banning hate works**

He writes:

>Watching social media executives trying to square this circle is like watching worms squirming on the head of a pin. The latest hapless exhibit is YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, who went to the South by Southwest conference in Texas last week to outline measures intended to curb the spread of misinformation on her platform. This will be achieved, apparently, by showing – alongside conspiracy-theory videos, for example – “additional information cues, including a text box linking to third-party sources [about] widely accepted events, like the moon landing”. It seems that the source of these magical text boxes will be Wikipedia.

Reddit isn't doing even that. Reddit is guaranteeing echo chambers of junk content who in many cases **actively ban** dissent or dissenting voices. 

In public, reddit's top staff are calling this ""valuable conversation"" worth having.


----

In a [speech earlier this september](https://points.datasociety.net/media-manipulation-strategic-amplification-and-responsible-journalism-95f4d611f462) 

Danah Boyd says, very accutely:

>Over the last 25 years, the tech industry has held steadfast to its commitment to creating new pathways for people who historically have not had access to the tools of scaled communication. Yet, at this very moment, those who built these tools and imagined letting a thousand flowers bloom are stepping back and wondering: what hath we wrought? Like the ACLU and other staunch free speech advocates, we all recognized that we would need to accept a certain amount of ugly speech. But never in their wildest imaginations did the creators of major social media realize that their tools of amplification would be weaponized to radicalize people towards extremism, gaslight publics, or serve as vehicles of cruel harassment.

Reddit is quickly becoming the only major platform without rules against hate speech.

Reddit is becoming (if it isn't already) the platform where haters gather to hate, unobstructed by mods who insulate their views against counter-speech and examination.

**1)** Why is reddit not banning hate speech when it works?

**2)** Why is reddit allowing hateful echo chambers

Every developed country in the world has some form of law on the books against hate speech except the United States. There are tonnes of legally practiced, clear, objective definitions with decades of jurisprudence to take from.

**3)** Why isn't reddit's policy team taking hate speech seriously?

**4)** What are the 3 biggest reasons for quarantining rather than banning the shittiest communities you choose to host? What are the 3 biggest reasons reddit view **for** banning hate communities rather than quarantining them? What other options in between are you considering, like banning removal of comments for dissenting with the circlejerk?

Quarantined communities don't get ads. They're effectively subsidized by the rest of reddit. all of reddit is paying to host its worst communities.

**5)** Why does, and should reddit sponsor hate?"
soccer,Yes. he's now their current manager as well.
redditdev,"You don't need to write a script or bot for this.

Just use automoderator (you'll find the help you need in /r/automoderator) "
TheoryOfReddit,"That's common on almost all of reddit.

If you agree with something, you just move on with your life. If you disagree, you're more likely to spend the time to write out a response.

You'll see tonnes of trees of comments like this that go opinion A/opinion B / A / B and so on down the tree.

Top comments are more likely to disagree with the OP since everyone who agreed/liked the post just moved on with their day after an upvote.

modnews,"That is not true when reporters attend and cover a private event, like at any non-public school."
modnews,"Irrespective of what you're saying in this post, the following section of a legally binding document is a dealbreaker:

>Please note that by attending the Reddit Mod Roadshow, you consent your voice, name, and/or likeness being used, without compensation, in films, photography and/or video for use in any and all media, marketing efforts whether now known or hereafter devised, for eternity, and you release Reddit, Inc., its successors, assigns and licensees from any liability whatsoever of any nature.

This use could make me incur a serious threat to my own personal safety **because** I volunteer moderate the communities I do on reddit.

As mods of large political communities, we get enough threats that you as employees are unwilling (and in many cases unable) to deal with, that I'd be daft to trust you with my name, likeness, moving pictures to do with what you will for eternity.

----

I'm sure you could manage legal language way closer to what you write in the post:

>(Don’t worry, if you’re still interested in maintaining your privacy, just let us know. We’ll make sure it’s easy to steer clear of being in any photos. This is just an early heads-up on the change to this year’s event.)

That is, if mods were worth that effort. From a large company like reddit, with several hundred employees, the difference here is so large there's no practical reason for this to be the case.

(continued in comment reply due to 10000 character limit.)"
TheoryOfReddit,"> without these limitations they can be counterproductive or even actively dangerous. Obviously it doesn't follow that I necessarily automatically support any and all regulation of those ideals, however. ;-)

Well put.

There's plenty of room for sensible limitations, like stopping people from advocating, in general terms, for the violent eradication of a group of people without disallowing them from characterizing that group of people in whatever morally bankrupt and objectionable terms they choose.

There are types of morally bankrupt speech that have no redeemable reasons to allow. Many of them can be legally disallowed without curbing the ability to express different opinions, views and ideas.

Being able to state objectionable ideas is necessary in a healthy society because counter-speech is important and effective, and obviously can't take place if you can't state the original idea that needs to be spoken out against.

---

Again, many especially Americans, equate outlawing hate speech with outlawing the speaking of many objectionable views, both political and otherwise. That's only natural because they aren't used to how these sorts of limits on speech function in practice.

There're way more precise levels of discernment to be employed.

Mass communication and mass audiences accessible to anyone lead to new arenas where thoughts and ideas are presented in completely novel ways. You can digitally choose to exist completely in a parallel society without any exposure to a marketplace of ideas that historically has only been available in very, very limited geographical settings.

This novel human condition, not current moral consensus on specific issues, is what leads us to require new legal exceptions to freedom of expression that weren't applicable a generation ago."
TheoryOfReddit,"There are a number of points I'd like to address from your comment. It's the totality of them all seen together that lead me to my conclusion.

I'll try to start at the start

---

Hate speech is not some nebulous term that defies objective definition, or that is difficult to pin down. It's not some term like pornography where ""[I know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it)"" can stand as a legal argument in the courts.

Again, since the US is the only developed country in the world without some law on the books against hate speech, we have  considerable legal precedent, many working definitions with accompanying jurisprudence, formal legal discussion and tested precedents. 

Yes, some people colloquially use hate speech as a term of derision regarding opinions they find morally objectionable. That's not how it works in practice in European courts, for example.

Poor definitions of hate speech, or a lack of familiarity with existing robust legal definitions of hate speech lead many Americans to think rules against actual hate speech will go **way** beyond what they actually cover.

The definition of ""fighting words"" and the legal responsibility for what is encompassed by the term is very limited in the US based on versions of [the Brandenburg test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio#The_Brandenburg_test_(also_known_as_the_imminent_lawless_action_test)).

Obviously people are responsible for their own actions. Therefore it's only sensible that telling someone to do something doesn't hold you responsible for someone else actually going through with what you say they should do.

But the level of specificity, and the demand for imminence with regard to incitement is extremely strict in the US.

The strictness of the demands of the low (compared to European and other developed countries) means that the US legal system comparatively ascribes lesser power to speech: it strictly follows that the more power you believe speech has, the more responsible you should be for the actions people themselves choose to perform influenced by your speech. Also legally.

---

As a continuation of the existing legal standard where you're responsible for the predictable consequences of your speech in the US today, as it stands although the standards of intent, imminence, and likelihood are extremely narrow, it stands to reason although there isn't legal culpability, there can be legal culpability beyond those strict criteria. 

For example, when you know you have a huge audience, you know that advocating for the eradication of a group of people because they posses an innate, unchosen characteristic will likely lead to acts of violence towards that group because some will understand you speaking that general advocation that the group should be removed from the earth is taken to be an instruction or suggestion to follow through with those words.

There are obvious, intended consequences that stem from hate speech, just the same way as fighting words or incitement, and similar types of speech that don't meet the strict legal requirements to constitute incitement.

---

There's a huge amount of ground to cover from clear hate speech where you advocate that anyone of a specific sexual orientation should be executed down to reaching the conclusion that insisting empirical or statistical facts are ""hate speech"".

It's easy to outlaw one without having to cover all that ground. The expected consequences from those very different statements are very different.

Disallowing hate speech isn't an all or nothing endeavor. The differing legal standards in different countries today is testament to that. 

I'm not advocating for a hugely inclusive definition of hate speech. I believe there are some very specific types of speech that should be outlawed as their net effect is demonstrably harmful to innately sensitive groups.

----

It's legally possible to determine that the intent of specific speech is to **try to get people of different opinions not to use their right to speak**. It's easy to demonstrate that rational people are intimidated away from speaking based on reasonable threats to their safety stemming from speaking.

When balancing the right for someone to speak hate or to intimidate people to silence against the required safety for a sensitive group to reasonably speak their minds, I find it morally objectionable to prioritize the right to speak hate over the right to feel reasonably safe to use your freedom of expression. "
TheoryOfReddit,">If privacy conscious people were to stop voting on Reddit, could this have a negative impact on privacy as a whole, because less content related to privacy will see the front page?

Yes. 

This is exactly analogous to the same result as reddit being one of few large English-language platforms not to have rules against hate speech. 

That directly leads reddit to have more hate speech as those who're negatively affected by common hate speech find other platforms to participate on. 

This in turn attracts people who speak hate in a positive feedback loop.

---

When you cater to one group at the expense of another, the result is pretty predictable and often self-reinforcing."
TheoryOfReddit,"Every developed country except the US has some law on the books (whether enforced or not) disallowing at least some forms of hate speech. The US has the world's oldest constitution; even with its small number of amendments, it's a relic from the 18th century.

Twenty or thirty years ago, the threshold for mass communication was high, and an audience of hundreds of thousands of people was a privilege with following responsibilities reserved for a very small amount of people.

The democratization of mass communication is unparalleled in history. It's like the advent of movable type, but instantaneous, free and much more interconnected.

---

Over-romanticizing the state of free speech and public discourse 30 years ago, when mass audience was reserved for the few and elites isn't a fair view of history.

With the democratization of large audiences, it's only reasonable that  people again wonder why some people defend speech where they only find the argument ""this isn't illegal to say"" as  a defense.

It's obvious why people demand a moral defense for expressing hugely objectionable opinions that aim to marginalize, intimidate or outright exterminate groups of people based on their innate, unchosen characteristics. 

A moral defense that goes beyond freedom of expression, which again simply means ""this isn't illegal to say""

---

Freedom of expression doesn't mean freedom from consequence when youexpress yourself. 

Say something irredeemable? Expect consequences from that speech.

It's my view that many who advocate freedom of expression without sensible exceptions like incitement, libel, state secrets, fighting words, hate speech and so on don't respect the power of speech.

People who don't understand how effectively hate speech intimidates entire groups of people from speaking don't understand the power of speech. 

There's a point where you favor those trying to silence others from speaking at the expense of the groups they aim to silence. More speech being allowed doesn't necessarily equate to a greater freedom of speech.

---

You're exactly right that some people are reacting to the drop in social capital with calls to a much overdue update of what safeguards for actually encouraging the maximum freedom of expression are reasonable.

Those people understand that a lot of the drop in social capital is caused by the coddling of speakers of hate (think Westboro baptist church) at the expense of the people they wish to marginalize and alienate. 

Of course the solution is to join the 21st century and add more sensible restrictions to speech in the age of mass communication. 

That's what's required to rebalance the equilibrium from hugely favoring those who speak to stop others from speaking to affording persecuted and sensitive groups an environment they aren't intimidated away from speaking in.

---

It's be a catastrophe if this very real understanding of modern speech and allowing unfettered hate is a ""temporary blip."" 

That's grossly underestimating the power of speech, and what freedom of expression actually entails."

politics,"I think you may be worried that the changes in the on-topic statement go much further than they actually do.


>we need to wait until someone from the US grows a pair and either says something about it or we get British citizens to come over and testify.

Nope. A journalist, commentator, or whoever just needs to make that connection in an article, so the implications for US politics are expressed in a single focus among many points in the overall story that don't directly concern US politics.

>Cambridge Analytica has been working on Republican campaigns since at least 2014, Donald Trump is only the latest to use them. The data that they used was our data and they effectively micro-targeted to an almost individual level, an obscene level of invasiveness.

Spelling out any of that in the article in a major theme (of many) would be enough to make the entire submission on-topic.

>The ONLY reason we happen to know about this is because of channel four and that British whistleblower. 

Articles that ONLY concern Cambridge Analyticas, say connection to the conservative party in Norway that don't deal with US politics are off-topic unless they make arguments on the page tying that content to US politics.

Any article regarding Cambridge analytica is not on-topic because they're tied to US politics in other ways unrelated to what an actual article is exclusively about."
politics,"This question?

> What if the same happened again? My comment will be removed instead?

For many types of insults or colorful language, yes. Our focus is on removing the content rather than banning, so in many cases the comment would be removed without a ban.

politics,Coding-wise making that sort of exception is difficult. That's why our all-caps rule regards all all-caps.
politics,"> What could have been done to prevent that from happening? What can non-mods do when witnessing that sort of comment spam overload?

Not a lot unless we want to make hugely invasive commenting rules that would require a ton of mod activity removing the comments as they're made.

Jokes come in many different forms, so removing them automatically is extremely difficult (pretty much impossible).

You can vote on content to have it be sorted as you'd like. There are individual usersettings in your reddit preferences that let you filter comments below a score threshold out of your personal view. That's one option if you want to continue to use the /new sorting.

Beyond that though, reddit kinda breaks down when threads get too many comments. It's a general site limitation. There are a set number of different views, and you can try the different ones to see which one works best in combination with clever reddit settings."
politics,"Unless any submission has a focus on politics (as defined by the [on-topic statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement) spelled out on the page, it's off-topic. "

>* Any content posted with a shortened link or via a redirect.

>Because the whole of Reddit relies on content produced by others, we have to protect the interests of content-creators or the quality of free content that we can share will drop.

Essentially, if a source is just reporting something by using content from the primary source without original analysis or reporting, that's rehosted content. 

As the sidebar summarizes:

> An article must contain significant analysis and original content--not just a few links of text among chunks of copy and pasted material.

The discretion regarding ""political on the page of the article"" is a lot less than the discretion required to judge whether or not an article reasonably infers US politics to the degree that they should be allowed.

The imposition to an actually new user is large. They have to wait the entire duration.

politics,">I guess I would like to know what's being done to ensure that this autofilter does not accidentally stifle genuine discussion.

You point out some of the very real and very relevant concerns regarding the use of automoderator.

We have automod set up to get at a lot of very obvious personal attacks that in the overwhelming majority of cases break our rules. Think ""you democrat scum"" type stuff.

We also have automod set to filter (remove and put in modqueue) phrases we see through vetting of the content removed to have a greater level of false positives.

Automoderator also reports (without removing) words that often, but not overwhelmingly occur in rule-breaking comments.

There are false positives and individual phrases we're evaluating and try out in various configurations. 

We look at what words **are being used** in rule-breaking comments compared to when they **are being used** in /r/politics in other ways. We've been and are systematically working on moving as much as possible from individual words to phrases to cut down on incorrect automatic removals. That's slow work and complicated because the volume of data and phrases we work with is large.

I respect that that's your opinion, but I disagree and find this to be a very difficult position to argue.

A simple, reasonable explanation is that /r/politics should be a subreddit for political content. Therefore it's completely reasonable to request that submissions have at least **one focus** on US politics.

Per the old standard, any long read that tangentially mentioned a politician or political issue in a single sentence out of a 20 000 word article would be germane. That's not reasonable because we'd be approving content that's clearly off-topic to the subreddit on a technicality."

I think it's extremely unlikely we'll allow submissions that don't explicitly deal with politics in the subreddit.

If the goal, as you outline, is to have this subreddit be an arena for political conversation, it seems counter-intuitive to allow content that doesn't deal with politics. Are those the submissions where the outset lends itself most to political conversation?

---

I agree that it's disruptive when popular submissions are removed. Removing a popular submission is always a failure in moderation.

We should have gotten around to the submission sooner. We need to get better and be more timely in moderation, both of submissions, but not in the least in the comment sections to prevent the internet fights in the comments rather than just cleaning them up after the fact when they've already disrupted the conversation."

/r/politics is a subreddit for the discussion of politics. Specifically US politics.

With regard to your last paragraph, I fundamentally disagree that it's distasteful to require submissions to /r/politics actually be about politics.

Further, plenty of topic regarding extremism, the interface and interaction between foreign and domestic affairs are still just as on-topic as they've been before.

TheoryOfReddit,"In person, there's also a time and a place and a type of person you need to have a long, serious and genuine discussion about things."
TheoryOfReddit,"It takes investment to be that one person who writes a comment. Just like it takes investment to send a letter to your local newspaper, although the threshold is lower.

The people who're the most invested in an issue are more likely to have a (strong) opinion on that issue. Therefore, a lot of the people who write comments have already made up their minds.

---

Further, a lot of people make comments on social media not in an effort to change someone else's opinion, but to connect with people who already share their views. Or to identify people they disagree vehemently with (so they can unfriend/remove them.

Through the system of both upvotes and downvotes, reddit as a platform caters strongly toward communities where the ever-so-slight majority opinion can downvote competing ideas completely out of view. That creates quite a specific environment that appeals to some types of people way more than other.

On top of that, there's the existing community on reddit itself that ever new user has to deal with.


---

Insults are easy and are often well received among others who share your specific strong opinion. They're also intellectually much easier than dealing with arguments. 

It's also a lot easier talking about something you know without reading the article or post that's ""supposed"" to be the onset of a specific submission. Even though that's completely off topic to the original submission, but it's a *somewhat related conversation*.

Reddit isn't that serious, and hidden behind usernames people are willing to say things to random internet strangers they'd never contemplate saying to anyone they know, much less to their face in meatspace.

---

But really, what kind of nerd takes the time to write a 2000 character response in a thread on reddit that isn't even about an actual topic, but about reddit itself?"
TheoryOfReddit,"A corollary that follows from this strategy, is that you avoid a homogeneous site culture:

You avoid generalizations about the entire site culture like ""youtube comments"" or ""twitch chat""  or ""9gag memes."" 

That's the idea anyway: being a site of separate communities rather than one community with multiple facets. 

----

For many users, dissociating with many major and popular aspects of reddit culture keeps them on the site. Take away community separation, and many of those people will leave."
announcements,"The issue, as with most design, is of affordances.

I'm sure the entire design team knows this, but for others who aren't as deep into the subject, here's a short overview.

---

The properties of the objects need to lead users to use them correctly. A door you need to pull should have a handle that leads to you pull it. An automatically sliding door shouldn't have one. 

When we navigate the web and click on something, we expect to arrive at that something. 

That's the most basic affordance of hyperlinking and it isn't something reddit can change unless they find a better solution to the same inherent design-problem across the web.

It's less clear cut with pictures: on some sites clicking on a clickable picture leads the picture to be enlarged, on other sites it leads to the image file or something else.

---

The basic, most common affordance of hyperlinking online, whenever you scroll through some feed, or are on some landing page, clicking on the title of a submission, you expect to come to that submission.

So inherently, marking the different use case, the text-post that exists on reddit and should lead to a comment page, should clearly and obviously  be distinguished from off-site links.

That means that self-post elements should be designed differently to link-posts so we intuitively realize they're different and should expect different results by clicking on them.

Alternatively, you get rid of link posts altogether (as in the redesign where you always land on the comments). If that's the goal, reddit has changed form its outset as a content aggregate.

Account age controls are trivial for actual trolls and bots to circumvent. I could make 10 or 50 accounts right now and just wait out a month or two or three then have a ton of accounts to troll with depending on the restrictions of each subreddit.

The exact same argument you're making was made during the election season for a similar reason:

That was all based off CTR naming reddit in a list of social media sites.

With the volume of graphics, videos, articles etc. they produce, for 35 employees, I personally don't think it's likely they've had resources close to what people have ascribed them to do stuff on reddit.

At least not to write huge volumes of unique comments on the same ""talking points""

No, it seems pretty obvious that calling users who don't share specific political opinions shills and trolls were overwhelmingly attacks on other users who have other beliefs.

Why not talk about the political issues instead of spending time on characterizations of random internet strangers instead?

----

We didn't jump the gun then and suggest that CTR had taken over the subreddit because we had **no evidence** to suggest they had and no tools to check whether that was the case or not.

History's  been kind on that decision: when we didn't have facts, we didn't jump to conclusions and present them as incontrovertible truths.

We don't know the extent of Russian meddling on reddit or /r/politics in particular. **It could be an absolutely massive issue,** or trivial compared to trolls from some other country. **We don't know.**

---

Online we often face a collapse of context: a single statement is presented without any context. The result is that you have to fill in the blanks yourself or make assumptions.

I'm personally super annoyed that the reddit admins (employees) don't give straight answers on anything. We don't have the tools or the information to know even something as basic as the percentage of Russian traffic to the subreddit.

We need to know something about scope if we're to make a post regarding manipulation of the subreddit. Otherwise the post itself lacks the context to be useful to users.

Only reddit admins (employees) have access to that kind of information.

They are unresponsive and unhelpful and provide mods with few/no tools and minimal support for dealing with efforts of manipulation.

I'm sure you understand why we don't shout from the rooftops about that tools that **are** available to us that would be come easier to circumvent if known about in detail.

I'm also sure you understand that those tools aren't good and do a poor job at dealing with manipulation.

The biggest feature we have available to us to deal with manipulation are real users voting based on quality rather than agreement, and voting often (especially in /r/politics/new).

There's nothing new about the issue. Our stance as a mod team has been constant on the issue for several years.

We don't know what proportion of new users are ban evaders, people paid to reddit, employees of whatever entity, people trolling for laughs, or just new redditors.

Therefore we can't assert that the behavior stems from the Russian government because we don't know that. It's just guessing since we have no way of separating someone with a US, Moroccan, British, Chinese, Russian or any other IP from other people.

We have rules against many types of trolling. That's why I'm saying you should report them so we can punish them according to our rules.

We don't have tools for separating real users sharing their actual opinions from people sharing nonsense for giggles when the comments they end up making are similar. The intent behind a comment is difficult to gauge in many cases.

Mods aren't arbiters of truth. We can't be expected to fact check and remove content that's wrong. I don't think we'd want random internet strangers passing that judgement and using it to remove content that hundreds or thousands of people interact with.

It's an ongoing conversation right now, so we obviously can't say what we agree on conclusively before that happens.

Right now, it seems that some sites are experimenting with crytpomining as financing free journalism for **only** users that adblock. It could be a flash in the pan, or a permanent strategy for monetizing users who currently view content without providing any revenue for the content creators.

This is pretty new stuff, so we need to figure out where we stand as a team. First and foremost, we need to be sure we have all the facts on what's actually going on, how these sites are operating and what that entails.

We're talking about it before we know what we'll do."

TheoryOfReddit,"Subreddits are one thing, It's much more efficient to cull hateful comments individually.

Think of it like a global automoderator that removes some of the worst junk. The filter's already there, but the admins only use it to remove other categories of things, like some types of personal information to name one example.

Let's say you have a comment that's only 15 characters, and it contains a clearly hateful phrase. All comments of that format could be instantly removed from the site. Build that repository with sensible exceptions, phrases, context, and you could meaningfully get at the entire culture of the site.

TheoryOfReddit,">Posting a big banner with a moral code of conduct and rules would go a long way towards fostering a healthy environment.

But that's entirely it: a healthy environment isn't the most profitable one, or the one that attracts most users.

You want provocative or downright wrong things to be said in a manner that riles people up, evokes strong emotional responses. That's what drives traffic: junk headlines that aren't substantiated and so on.

Facebook's goal isn't and will never be to be a good opinion forum.

You're entirely right that Facebook hasn't tried to create an ethic for posting articles. They don't remind people to be sensible about what they share about themselves, or to ask people if it's okay before sharing a picture of them.

Doing those things is directly bad for business.

The whole rest of the post breaks down at the point you assert Facebook or reddit want to create the healthiest possible environments because that's not in their business interest. 

The advice for how to create a good community could be good but that's besides the point.

Reddit could hugely improve the community by banning the worst and most obvious types of hate speech on a sitewide level. We know the tools are there, it's simply a matter of adding those phrases to the sitewide filter alongside other things that are already there."
TheoryOfReddit,">Our subreddit is heavily curated by design but does so with an eye towards facilitating robust conversation. Any moderation process must be both scalable and frictionless wherever possible. **This parallels, I suspect, with Facebook’s goals.**

This is where it all breaks down.

Being a boss of a large social media site today is a lot like being a politician:

- you have a large focus on *vision* and appearance
- you focus on PR wins
- growth for your domain is the eternal aim
- you have a platform where the premises and your world view are outlined
- what you say and what you do often don't match in the slightest or contradict each other.
- you do things for ""re-election"" and to avoid others imposing rules on you

Facebook doesn't want robust conversation. They want everyone to use their site.

Facebook doesn't want heavy curation. They want pageviews and engagement.

Facebook doesn't want scalable moderation, they want as little moderation as possible for two reasons: Moderation is inherently unpopular as removal of user-submitted content is its primary task. It removes engagement and traffic because there's less talk overall. 

---

Like reddit and other social media firms, Facebook deals with things that hurt reputation. The fix isn't changing core behavior but changing perception.

Facbook has had massive negative press regarding fake news and being easy to manipulate, a basic platform for creating bubbles around people, and actively using the site to mislead people.

How do you deal with that? 

You say the right things. You make changes in feeds that (slightly) reduce time spent on the site in the short term and then make grandiose claims that you're doing it because it's right^TM rather than acknowledging that it's in the self-interest of the company in the medium and long term because you're keeping people from abandoning their accounts and jumping ship.

When  your entire platform is built (like reddit) in a way that creates agreement bubbles and factionesque behavior, you say that you're making changes to create common ground. It's the right thing to say, but when your whole site is based around feeding you more of what you interact with, you either change that core behavior if you're serious. OR, what you're saying is disingenuous, but is the right thing to say to shareholders.

If Facebook, or reddit take ownership of their content problems, they bring to attention the fact that [online platforms have been inhabiting a parallel legal universe. Broadly speaking, they are not legally responsible, either for what their users do or for the harm that their services can cause in the real world.](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21716661-platforms-have-benefited-greatly-special-legal-and-regulatory-treatment-internet-firms)

What if social media sites, like newspapers (except online comment feeds), were responsible for what they do? The whole business model breaks down and becomes way more cost-intensive.

It'd definitely be nice with more updates, but the reasons for not doing this in terms of processing requirements explain at least why the site's designed that way."
TheoryOfReddit,"The trend you identify predates /r/The_Donald and the summer of 2015 by at least two years. Mod teams were preemptively banning users for participating in other communities (like /r/fatpeoplehate to name one famous example) before that.

Even things like [finally disallowing harassment](https://redditblog.com/2015/05/14/promote-ideas-protect-people/) happened before the creation of /r/The_Donald. 

I use that example for a reason: even in [that same thread regarding new harassment rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/35ym8t/promote_ideas_protect_people/cr917e1/), [a 2015 survey that predates /r/The_Donald](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QJBPZt0oa3UCkL6QGBHp6vITXs3f1bYcCyA5xIQcFZw/pub) is discussed. The survey itself states the following:

>Moderation and censorship

>On the other hand, 35% of complaints from extremely dissatisfied users were about heavy handed moderation and censorship. This also came up in 10% of overall dislike comments.

(Those ""extremely dissatisfied"" responses number 111 people.)"
beta,">""**This content was engaging enough for me to vote**, but it neither deserved an upvote nor a downvote"".

The vote for content that isn't worth a downvote for a specific reason is the upvote. 

At least the *idea* is that the two votes aren't equivalent to being simply ""like"" and ""dislike"" and aren't opposite equivalents of each other"
beta,"The current A/B test that really gets to me is the one that forces you to create an account to view content on reddit.

That's a surefire way to ensure that I'll never consume content on that site.

Even just showing that reddit is a company that is willing to consider something like that is disappointing. 

It's such a clear indication that usability and the users are no longer a priority, and the priorities within the company have warped away from the values that let the site grow to the size it is today."

Norway's a good example here, because it's an oil-producing country that earlier this year offered up 93 oil blocs for exploration. Nothing special there, except that the blocs are north of the arctic circle and closing steadily in on marine wildlife sanctuaries and large fishing ecosystems.

Is  it okay for Norway as a country to pay off poor countries like Brazil so they don't cut their rain forests down instead of decreasing domestic emissions?

Norway basically became a developed country on the back of its oil wealth. Is it fair for Norway to essentially pull the ladder up after getting rich off of pumping CO2 out of the ground?

Is it fair for Norway to demand that developing countries don't increase their emissions while Norwegian oil-wealth is financing large investments in green technology, trying to create a sustained tech-gap that's a result of oil money?

Again, this is a matter of perspective. Things get really complicated in terms of policy when you weigh the types of subsidies or favorable deals the US already gives for various non-environmental reasons, whether those are military, developmental, strategic or whatever else.

I don't want to mix politics into this more than strictly necessary, but there are large capital flows from the US to foreign programs and allies I think scientifically speaking are much more dubious than the type of alternatives for environmental programs paying to protect forest (or wildlife) is."
science,"Norway has had, what shall we say, [mixed success](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/22/norway-issues-1bn-threat-brazil-rising-amazon-destruction) with paying to stop Brazilian rain forest from being cut down.

What steps do you think would be necessary to ensure the project works well?

What experiences in your Ugandan project can be scaled up to the size of government-sized projects, or do you think being small is a feature for success?"

politics,"The whitelist filters out actual spam.

For a spammer who makes a post ""visit our sex site"" with a throwaway domain like a049sd.we.ha or something, getting eyeballs on your post even if people always downvote your post is a success.

Being flooded by those kinds of posts also makes /r/politics/new a place most people wouldn't want to spend their time. That means the people left there who essentially determine what has the potential to rise through the subreddit, get to decide for the subreddit because people won't put up with shifting through actual spam and blog spam.

That's what this whitelist gets at. We aim to expand the whitelisted sites to include as many sites as possible to ensure the whitelist doesn't gate out real on-topic domains that create content about US politics."
politics,">I should have realized that.

I wouldn't say so. Reddit has a ton of extremely useful functionality that isn't listed anywhere. The site is really bad at letting people get the most out of using the site.

announcements,"> This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period 

As a mod, all the mods I've spoken to recently say they've either 

a) stopped trying to report spam to the admins because nothing happens with most of those reports anyway after the recent loosening in spam what you consider spam.

or 

b) stopped trying to report most rule-breaking because it now takes so long to get an admin response for most issues by that time the report's too old to do anything meaningful about. You can say average response times are going down, but that's not a good measure of how tickets are being responded to.

Your presentation of this as a win rather than a huge negative is just another step in continuation of the rapidly deteriorating relationship between admins and mods.

It's no wonder so many mods express frustration about the lack of understanding from admins about the needs. What's up with that terrible change to the reports system to make it a terribly cumbersome process that simultaneously encourages people to block people to create their own echo chambers.

I get that you're launching a bunch of changes without hearing user feedback because you wouldn't have changed the feature releases due to feedback anyway. That's fine, not leading people on.

But reddit's corporate voice feels less and less sincere. The site's users can tell."

politics,"To elaborate:

We get a *lot* of messages that amount to not liking a source, and therefore asking us to ban it.

We have a pretty [clearly defined set of rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/filtereddomains) for what it takes for us to ban a source. Those criteria are restrictive because the mod team doesn't think we should restrict political points of view more than necessary.

Shareblue is one of the domains that approaches some of those criteria, and is discussed among the mod team pretty regularly, alongside some other domains.

The best and the worst thing about reddit is that the votes decide what content that rises to the top. Vote early (/r/politics/new). Vote often.
