wow,"OK I've had a better time of it reading all these helpful comments, so thanks to everyone who left one!

Another dumb/obvious question: If I FoF and my energy will cap during its duration, I want to finish off the total channel right rather than Tiger Palming (or any other energy spender), because its my most damaging ability right?"
wow,"OK that's helpful, thanks. It mostly started after I imported a WA set that played a sound whenever I used two abilities back to back. That + learning dungeons at the same time was too much but after a couple days I haven't seemed to really be able to get down a decent rotation.

In dungeons, when I am talented into Dance of Chi-ji, is the best method to be tab targetting the mobs as I tiger palm/blackout kick?"
wow,"I just came back and levelled a monk on my friend’s server. I levelled brewmaster (as that was wowhead’s recommendation) but switched to windwalker around the start of Shadowlands levelling. 

I don’t know why but Monk simply isn’t clicking for me. I feel so anxious about my rotation that I can’t even bring myself to queue for 5 mans because I feel so unsure about what I’m doing. Does anyone have any advice? I’ve read the guides on wowhead but I still don’t feel super comfortable on what to do moment to moment."

taskmaster,Back to back amazing episodes - I didn’t realise they were such good friends beforehand! I love how the losers still harbour such regret and grudges against the scoring. A second place All-star season would be incredible.
taskmaster,One of my favourite episodes! I loved her retrospective on her season.
stormkingsthunder,"It's a tough predicament. He is the king so he should stand above a normal storm giant. But at the same time, you don't really want to buff a NPC because it takes the shine away from the players. Thinking back, the final battle was pretty difficult for Iymrith because there was no real way to damage the Storm Giants outside of her melee attacks. But being close to them would mean some massive damage coming her way, so it was a bit of a challenge to try and plink away while trying to take down the giant bodyguards.

I would suggest coming up with some support spells that Hekaton can cast, mostly to increase the PCs chances in battle, rather than enhancing his own combat prowess."
giantbomb,"Yeah, easily the best thing that came out of the stream for me. I spent the day playing the multiplayer and finishing up a run through the single player thanks to Game Pass.

Holy shit I love this game and the co-op multiplayer is an amazing experience."
stormkingsthunder,"I mostly ignored random encounters during airship travel as we were in the mid-late game in terms of the module. I felt like expediting overland travel was its own sort of reward so unless they passed by a specific city or area, it was mostly fine. 

That being said, I would have thrown in more weird/social encounters such as the ones described in the second half of Leo's comment. Just weird ass shit you wouldn't expect to see that high up and no one really knows about."

DnD,It’s an optional rule in Xanathar’s. It states that you regain a quarter of your hit dice and don’t recover from exhaustion if you wear medium or heavy armor.

Games,I’ve never played gang beasts but watched lots of videos on it over the years but I believe they ended up reworking the graphics and control systems once or twice. It never felt like they found their footing and get iterating on themselves.
stormkingsthunder,"I just ran the Iymrith fight and can confirm the Stone Golem/Shield Guardian mix really helped! I only had one, but it really increased Iymrith's longevity. The key, I think, is that there needs to be a way to clear out or thin the Storm Giant numbers. As it stands, her most damaging ability - her breath attack, only severely damages the player characters, which is exactly what you don't want.

Having the players go down and the Giants attacking her is the worst case scenario, but I couldn't figure out a great way to nullify the Giants other than slowly whittling them down with attacks."
stormkingsthunder,"How did they infiltrate the forge? My players went through the Yak village and then down the mines, but if the Yaks are still available I'd say Brimskarda would have attempted to subjugate/hire them to work the wheel and assembly lines. 

There aren't enough orcs to have a functioning forge, so its either dead and most of the Fire Giants have left or are planning to leave, or Brimskarda has found an alternate solution to the manpower.

If the players managed to assassinate Zalto (which seems like an incredible feat of skill and/or luck) then I'd reward them for that and say the encounter is mostly finished. If you want a final showdown you can have Brimskarda with one or two bodyguards still loyal to her and her family, but the rest of the forge is deserted."

edit: OK I finished it - I gotta say as someone who put this on in the background/2nd monitor the extra editing for the extraneous sounds has to be turned down a little bit. My ear holes were blown wide open whenever one of those started playing."
FallGuysGame,"I’m inclined to agree. I think the expectations were blown out of proportion but they should have been working on messaging from the start. Calling it a new season gives a bad impression and compared to calling it the “Medieval Update” or something I think people would have been more on board.

Don’t get me wrong, 4 maps would still be too low but at least you wouldn’t have people expecting an entire slew of new games."

giantbomb,Good point - so he’s just using a zoomed in feed of a much wider camera?
giantbomb,lmao thats when I unmuted as well. It was also weird to have such a big disparity in video quality. I don't know if it was the green screen or what but Dan's video looked completely trash compared to Mary's. Mike's was fine but it felt like Mary was streaming instead of Dan
Dimension20,"I’ll preface this by saying I don’t have an issue with Marisha’s character and love all the accents on the show. That being said, comparing a NPC to a PC is a bad example because a NPC *can* take on a grating and annoying accent or have an adversarial personality because they are exactly that, a non-player character. 

You can have an annoying voice for 5 minutes, and never see that character again for another 30 hours. But an annoying PC is there for almost every interaction. There’s no running away from that scene, and if they don’t change then it’s there for the entire campaign."
videos,Yes! I loved Dorm Life when it was airing
giantbomb,“Oh cmon! The game has been out for 15 seconds. The statute has to be over by then right?”
dndnext,"Really like your suggestions! My main gripe with flashbacks or dream sequences (as much as I like them as narrative tools) is that they can be limited to one character's personal story. So even if I want to give the player agency, my main goal is really some exposition and I want to get that done ASAP, and not bog down the session with some one-on-one roleplay. I've found these sequences to be really jarring for the players and when given an option to interact, they don't really know what to do unless it's super obvious - and if it is obvious, then I should just take the reins anyway."
HadesTheGame,Cast/Call? Or did he only get it right before the fight
HadesTheGame,How did you get the pom flower to pop only on the special? Just luck or did you do something specific
giantbomb,"Yeah totally. It's also a testament to how Early Access can shape the game. While they had an ideal image of how the game should look and feel, the community really rallied around the gameplay's balance and QoL stuff that I think really helped to make 1.0 shine. The amount of voice work in the game alone is staggering to see and it was a joy to see new voice lines added with every patch and to see a little trickle of story come down every time.

Switch would be ideal if I could get over the joycon and pricing, but ultimately I play Hades with M+KB so I don't think I could switch over, portability aside."
rpghorrorstories,"Hey I'm in the middle of the exact same thing (fighting Iymrith I mean). This totally sucks but take solace in the fact that you managed to run a campaign for over a year! Wrapping up a campaign with a nice bow is satisfying but you've already done the hard work, so just put these experiences to the next one and it'll be even better!"
giantbomb,"I plowed through it when it hit Steam and then stopped after a couple weeks. I managed to hold off on the next two major updates leading to the release so it's been nice to catch up on what I missed. 

I wonder if my opinion would change at all if I got to see the Epilogue of each run right as I was progressing or whether or not I'd be annoyed it ended quickly after that."
giantbomb,"It's a really good game. I don't know if its the best Roguelike I've ever played, but the production values (art/music/aesthetic) is definitely at the top of the list. Compared to things like Binding of Isaac, Slay the Spire or even Dead Cells, Hades just has a *complete* vision and world.

I somewhat regret playing so much in Early Access as I don't think I'll play much of 1.0 once I get 32 Heat and the rest of the achievements down, but it was a fantastic experience regardless."
DescentintoAvernus,"How many sessions (and how long were they) did you get through? 

Did you use any 3rd party materials (Eventyr’s guide or DMsGuild products) or was it mostly module + homebrew?

What did you do to pad out or make travel interesting? Did you get to the point where they were teleporting from place to place?"

Still that match was super close with a ton of blunders from both players, I think he could've pulled it out."

Even someone like QTCinderella is fine with me because she seems to play some games even though she is frustrated with it.

The format is extremely forgiving which means there are a lot of games to play. If you’re checked out after the first round it’s still at least 6 more games of losing before you’re totally out. 

It’s also disappointing because you see some streamers get so invested and addicted to chess and I’m sure there are smaller streamers that would love a free diamond account and coaching from titled players."

northernlion,"*Red players swarming him*

WHY ARE YOU GRABBIN ME? IM ON THE SAME TEAM"
stormkingsthunder,In that case I think you've laid out a fairly good case for it to increase alongside the other weapons. Breath Weapons are so underutilised anyway that I'd be more than happy to extend a temporary buff under the potion for it. I'd just double the damage die for whatever your breath weapon does at that point in time.
stormkingsthunder,"I would highly suggest avoiding this subreddit and instead just speaking with your DM if or when you get a Potion of Giant Size. Your problem is fairly niche and if you already know what the potion is, you should know its rarity and the other effects.

If I'm being totally honest, I don't think it would play a huge factor either way. I can't give exact reasons why since you don't want spoilers, but it's not something you should concern yourself about."
criticalrole,"Yes but it’s important to get the facts straight so people have their expectations in check. If anything, it’s great that a player and DM worked together to flesh out their backstory after they got an idea from a session. 

Some people will think Sam crafted an elaborate tragic backstory and every move in or out of combat was a pre-calculated decision to reinforce her characteristics and make the reveal *that* more excruciating. But the reality is a lot messier and closer to how most DND games are run!"

VALORANT,Dude how do you play with like 6 people talking at once from discord and game
formula1,"That's like saying Matt Serra's win over GSP is more impressive than GSP's entire championship run. Like yes, a win over GSP is fantastic but that doesn't mean make GSP's career less impressive in retrospect."
DescentintoAvernus,"Yes what the others said - get them to Avernus ASAP and in a War Machine. With 7 sessions you can speed through some of the best set pieces and swing by some heavy hitter NPCs.

I’d just set them off on a single task and run them through a gauntlet of devils and demons. At some point they’ll hit a rough patch and you can do a couple of devil deals if that’s something you’re interested in. You don’t have to end it with big bad Zariel but someone like Arkhan or Haruman instead."
DescentintoAvernus,"Yeah I came to the same reasoning. It already does a lot of damage without doubling it against vehicles, making it best in class by a mile if it does. I have done one combat with doubling and another without but I think going forward I will discuss with my players and hopefully they see my reasoning for it not to apply."
stormkingsthunder,"Little late to the party but how many players are in your campaign? If you're running 4-5 (or less) then I don't think you should deter them. If they are hellbent on finding Ironslag and feel like you're just giving them a wild goose chase then they'll be pissed if they ever find out or just feel like the campaign is meandering without anything really happening. 

At 6th? level, they would get destroyed by Ironslag. So let them through and plan for an escape route, because they simply won't get through even half of that dungeon without having to bail and run away. Don't go in there expecting a TPK but an experience to show them the force that they're dealing with, and the firepower they'll need to bring this guy down.

That gives you some time to advance the clock so that when they come back at 8th or 9th level, they'll be stronger, possibly have allies, and Duke Zalto will have advanced his Vonindod plan further."

Games,Cheers that helps! I really like Golding everything before moving on but I suppose I'll have to learn to just accept the silver and keep trucking until I can't. I really like recipes where I can memorise an acronym to bang out (like DRS or GWP for Dango or something) and absolutely loathe ones with dozens of ingredients that change with each order.
formula1,Yes I didn't mean it immediately I'm just interested in a breakdown of his driving as I don't fall on either side of the Stroll train and want to know if he's actually a quality driver or not. Hulk next week would be bomb if he gets to drive!
Games,I’ve been enjoying it a lot too and will probably jump back in to try and get to this new Iron Chef challenge soon. I was wondering if you could speak to the incentive to try out new recipes? I’m only two or three cities in but I’m torn between wanting all golds doing the bare minimum/same recipes or branching out into the 3 and 4 point recipes. Is there a tangible benefit to those past getting more money? It doesn’t feel that worth it if I end up messing the order up anyway and have to restart the level for the gold.
formula1,Really interesting insights! I think having a spotlight on a driver makes sense when they undergo a change or are under particular scrutiny for whatever reason. In this case Albon’s new engineer and rising concern about his position at RB. Would like to see one for Stroll sometime.
videos,Can I ask you who this question is to?
criticalrole,But it says nothing about losing hold of the grapple when casting spells with a Somatic component. Hell you don't even get disadvantage on melee attacks if you're *being* grappled let alone doing the grappling.
giantbomb,wtf
Dimension20,"I would contend that this is only in the context of takeout and in a low-stakes scenario, where the restaurant isn’t special or serving anything new. If you’re sitting down or obviously trying a new cuisine, then get a menu. But I would be lying if I didn’t have my set orders for different basic regional cuisines that I would order in a snap judgment."

giantbomb,"Yes you hit the nail on the head, and I think the reason why that's so exciting is because it's exactly how GB first began. Just making content and videos out of a small basement studio that was cramped with equipment that was a mishmash of old and new. Doing shows that seemed genuinely interesting to them and they had the passion to create.

That breathe of fresh air contrasted so heavily to GBWest at the time which is what contributed to the large divide that I saw in the communities I frequented, which was a shame."
dndnext,A bit of a miner yourself
Games,Was waiting for this to drop to see if I should pick TLOU2 or Tsushima. The criticisms make it sound like the open world elements get repetitive. Might spring for TLOU2 instead.
dndnext,D&D Beyond used to (still might) do an awful job separating the information and delineating what the sources are. Specifically the Elves - anything regarding Elves from any setting are just tossed into one huge pile that is impossible to navigate. You have lore from two or three different settings melding together and if a new player were to look at that they would be insanely confused.

Roll20,"Yeah to follow up what the other guy said: AFOW + Dynamic Lighting on a huge map will run the risk of crashing your browser. If you aren't careful you can be stuck in an infinite loop, like me! I had to go through a really roundabout solution when I accidentally put AFOW on in a SKT dungeon and the tab constantly died."

northernlion,Ugh can't get my controller to work with the game. It drifts left and also tanks my framerate for some reason. I had to play with keyboard and just barely scraped a gold.
DescentintoAvernus,"Check out a DND channel called the High Rollers, they did a short series using their old characters from their first campaign. I wouldn’t use any of the Baldur’s Gate stuff and just send them straight into Avernus, either being in Elturel for its fall or some other method. Then just run it from there replacing the low CR devils with the much higher ones"
highrollersdnd,"But Mark stated that it doesn't matter who draws the card, an upright Broken One means the Challengers (the party and Thalia) win, while a reverse Broken One means the Challengers lose. So if there is a reversed Broken One, which seems to be the case because the Eye would have likely pointed to an Upright Broken One since Quill asked, ""Which card will win us the game?"" and not something like, which card will give us the most points or something.

I don't know what counterplay Quill has left even with another eye charge?"
dungeondraft,Beautiful! Did you use Sploot’s time lapse video as inspiration? Looks like a fantastic spin off of it.
stormkingsthunder,"Yeah like the previous poster said the two aerial encounters are really the only things provided. You can allow your party to do limited downtime activities, one member attempted to teach the rest of the party Giant and while it isn't as simple as a couple day's and a check, it at least became a plot point we've referred back to through the dozens of sessions since.

Other than that, I had a NPC be on the castle with Zephyros as the giant isn't that talkative aside from the exposition he gives at the start. It gave them someone to bounce of off at least. But if you don't like the two encounters you can also just skip ahead, you don't have to play out every day if nothing happens."
Games,"I smashed the game with Linda, but Lucy was my favourite. Linda’s style was boring and a bit tedious but was also the absolute safest out of all of them. I could clear entire floors without getting hit or whole dungeons without too much damage. Great game though, can’t wait to jump back in

Edit: just looked up which one Mark was, and yeah, he’s definitely my least favourite."
dndnext,"I think it's mostly the fear at the fragility of the PCs at that level. With only a single hit dice + CON worth of HP, some characters will and can go down from a single swing of a goblin's scimitar. Even d10 or d12 hit die classes can easily go down after two swings, so you suddenly come up against the length and extent of how much a 1st level adventurer can handle. 

Of course if you aren't hitting them with combat every session and your campaign is more about intrigue or urban escapades that don't involve a fight in an alley every 5 minutes, then I can see how you might spend a while at the lower levels. 

But I think the main point is that for DMs, it saves them the worry of instantly killing a player's fresh character with a lucky crit, and for the players it gets more tools and class features into their hands so that they have a bit more identity and options to deal with the scenarios their DM throws at them."
giantbomb,PM'd with key!
giantbomb,"Related to Humble but not this specific bundle, I still have 3 choices left from both the May and April Humble Bundle. I'll only list the choices available as I have claimed/given away the other games.

* ~~Neoverse~~

~~April 2020~~:

stormkingsthunder,"I would just make a new thread and maybe edit a link to that in your original post in case anyone stumbles on that! And PMing, thank you"
stormkingsthunder,"Would you mind posting the aftermath? My party are likely heading there this week so I won't get to see how you ran it, but I like it a lot! I always thought it was kind of lame that this huge complex just gets trashed by an ambush by 4 giants. Could I PM you with my campaign specifics for some thoughts on how to adjust for my campaign?"
stormkingsthunder,"Don't think the orcs would be able to use their Aggressive trait as they are mounted, right?

But depending on how you play out Triboar it doesn't *really* matter. I would recommend a theatre of the mind style play or break it out into several 'scenario' style maps depending on where your PCs decide to go. I tried playing it on the huge town map as that was provided on Roll20 and it was a pretty big mistake. I wouldn't recommend it."
stormkingsthunder,"I meant even if the rem misses their attacks, the party will still be taking pretty significant damage per round"
stormkingsthunder,"Notably the Heated Body will be a big leveller, regardless of if they miss the bite/swallow. Just being able to deal guaranteed damage to attackers is going to be so much damage for low levels."
Games,"Syndicate is the peak of that style before they refreshed it completely with Origins. It’s super solid and reminded me of Brotherhood and Victorian London is a great romp. Evie is a fun character and luckily you can limit your play with Jacob. Definitely recommend if you want a blast back to OHKO counters and more assassin-y gameplay, but Origins and Odyssey are good too."
giantbomb,the English VA put me off so much that I might s.link Yukiko instead.

giantbomb,"god thank you, I couldn't continue playing after meeting those guys"
giantbomb,Steal my Sunshine! Specifically the episodes where they had to do those platforming challenges in a demiplane. Burgle didn’t capture my attention as much - there was something special with such a wild concept and a terrible but kind of bearable game
MMA,"He never went back after beating TJ, and he only had the FlyW belt then."
giantbomb,"Depends on what you like - the Resistance: Avalon games are probably worth it, though they aren’t all 100% on the same page. The Pathfinder/DND stuff is hit or miss but can be fun if you aren’t expecting anything amazing."
dndnext,"I believe so, you get a single cast of the spell once per long(?) rest. Not sure if it’s short or long as I didn’t read through every God but you get the idea."
dndnext,"Similar to the Renown system in Ravnica or the factions in SCAG/Adventurer’s League.

You gain 1 piety for acting within your god’s tenets and wishes, with DM discretion for more for doing more significant acts. There are 4 breakpoints of Piety where you gain new traits or ability to cast a spell without material component cost at 3/10/25/50."

giantbomb,"Awful - 31%. I just couldn't remember anything! I also typed >!GTA IV/4 and Wolfenstein: New Colossus!< and those didn't work, but I guess I should've kept trying."
stormkingsthunder,"They’re certainly usable but your party needs to swing through Everlund and that could take a while. In my campaign that’s exactly what they did and after unlocking the circles they did get an airship, and it was one they could continually use rather than a single time like the module.

It gave a nice ramp up of abilities to eventual overland travel soaring through the skies."
stormkingsthunder,"You'll find the campaign to be much more linear in structure, and perhaps shorter if you end up squishing travel times as well.

Chapter 3 is tough but necessary, and has the potential to be some of the best parts of the game."
giantbomb,I was skeptical but I've had one for over a year at this point and it's been great the entire time! I have a little fraying on the arm rests but no real complaints.
malaysia,Do you guys have any good websites for buying PC parts? Like a Newegg or Amazon style website where the vendors are all in one place?
Games,"Giant Bomb did a similar series called Exquisite Corps, though I think it was with XCOM 1. They had 3 players and each player took charge of a single mission and the strategy layer leading up to a mission. It led to some hilarious results and prioritization from a certain player while the other two scrambled to try and salvage what they could."
highrollersdnd,Just to add - I’m 99% sure he also uses Dungeondraft to create the custom battle maps during the Aerois sessions.
totalwar,Unfortunately I wasn’t able to fend off Marathi and lost Caledor shortly after confederation. I’m now staring down the pike at an endless wave of Greenskins as they’ve just killed Karaz-a-Karak. Hopefully I’ll make my way to Caledor but I’m just going to try and hold onto my 3 provinces for the time being.
totalwar,"Ooh I never actually played another High Elf faction after I picked up Queen & Crone. That makes sense, thanks!"
totalwar,"I also am finding the Dragon Princes to be pretty bad even against normal Clanrats - but maybe it's because I'm not using them great. The Sun Dragon is awesome though, I just don't really know what I want to outfit my stack with. When did they change Handmaiden's Gallery to Tier 4? I could've sworn they're Tier 3 in Alarielle's campaign."
totalwar,Same except she destroyed Caledor coz I was too poor trying to chase down Sniktch
dndnext,"It really depends on how drained your party is when tackling it. I used an “Action-Oriented” monster version of Nezznar and removed two spiders. I had 3 PCs but 2 NPCs (one was a PC that had dropped out) and they went into it fairly drained and hurt. They just barely lost but it was enough to take them out and capture them. 

If your PCs are beefed up and they have a full rest, they will likely destroy the encounter, even with the initiate as is. If they are half HP with most of their spells, which is likely the intended scenario having walked through that big bugbear encounter prior, then it will be challenging."
giantbomb,Restaurants must be hell for you
dndnext,"That’d make it more in line with it, especially with 11 AC. It just changes the fight dynamic though so be sure that’s what you want"
dndnext,"Short answer: No it’d be much tougher.

The initiate has twice Nezznar’s HP and more damage per round. He doesn’t output a ton of damage, it’s mostly to aid his minions through Faerie Fire or Darkness.

If you want a tough singular enemy this can work but you’d probably do well to remove the additional enemies in his lair."
totalwar,It’s a reference to “Nobody puts Baby in the corner” from Dirty Dancing
northernlion,"Yooo what a sick addition, thank you for the hard work! It's been less of an issue since Chapters but I used to come to the subreddit and check the megathread to see what games they played so I wouldn't have to scrub through the VOD - super useful to have a bot!"
giantbomb,"No they've been 1080p, guessing its the speed of the upload or slowness on youtube's end?"
stormkingsthunder,"This is incredible, thank you! I especially appreciate the Roll20 notes and the location labels as well."
giantbomb,Yeah it's been mostly bug-free for me too! I had two bugreport/crashes but it was mid-level and autosaved just as the turn started so I didn't lose anything. Just beat the game yesterday and I'm keen to jump back in at a harder difficulty/custom starter squad.
highrollersdnd,"Yeah that's true, I hadn't fully considered that reality. Unfortunately for the players they can only hope Mark is a benevolent DM that won't unnecessarily advance time on Aerois 100 years in the future just for the laughs."
highrollersdnd,"That’s pretty much up to Mark/DM fiat. The only plane I know that has timey-wimey stuff is the Feywild but even that is mostly up to the DM to handle. It’ll depend how long and how much Mark wants to build out Elysium, as well as where they head after!"
stormkingsthunder,"I've run it once and it was a huge mess, mostly due to my own making. I swapped out some Orcs/Orogs in exchange for Hill Giants and a custom group of Orcs for a player's backstory. The plan was for the Fire Giants to stomp straight through the town and beeline for the fragment, only attacking characters if they stood in their way or attacked them while they dug. I'd then have the Hill Giants and raiding magmins/orogs be side battles that were very possible to win, and eventually have a showdown with the Fire Giants when their resources were depleted.

I think the concept can work, but my execution dragged the battle down completely and it felt bad all around for my players and myself. I've mostly a Roll20 GM, so I figured I would run the whole thing on the Triboar town map, why not right? I had not considered breaking up the fights in a narrative manner or how the fights should start. Roll20 estimated the scale and I should've just used Theatre of the Mind or made things more videogamey (like your scenario picking suggestion) but instead I plonked the invading force on the top left of the map, and then had everyone roll initiative.

What followed were 10 - 20 rounds of PCs and NPCs just dashing around, since it would take forever to get somewhere. My orc group was ignored until everything was taken care off, while I had to manage 20-30 some NPCs fighting other NPCs/burning buildings. It was super exhausting and I definitely have ideas on how to run bigger battles should they arise."
MMA,I remember watching him on RM with people like Hong-man Choi. The highlight reels they'd play were fucking awesome

NLSSCircleJerk,"The Crew, co-op trick taking game they played today"
dndnext,"I wholeheartedly recommend starting with published. Do not feel like you have to adhere 100% to the adventure, but it gives you an incredible base that you can start with and reflavor/tweak as you see fit. It's kind of like training wheels (depending on the module) and it gives you a really solid foundation where you can build on if you wish to."
stormkingsthunder,"Ooh, like a play by post? Nice!"

dndmemes,DNDBeyond already sells their sourcebooks at a discount to hard copies
stormkingsthunder,"It's... tough. This is the part of the book where they kind of turn it over to you and say, ""Do what you want!"" There are a multitude of hooks in place for different locations around the Sword Coast, and you're essentially free to structure it however you want up til the point where you think it is time to introduce Harshnag. 

Now what does that exactly mean? Well it means looking at both your player's motivations and your own. Are your players enjoying having a romp through the Sword Coast, or are they chomping at the bit really wanting to move forward with the giant business? If the former, then you can take your time - work in their backgrounds, leave some clues foreshadowing the future villains, and overall take it slow. If the latter, then you may want to start leaving bigger more blatant clues, clear areas where they will find concrete information.

For your own part, you'll have to look at how much work you're willing to put in against what the book provides. The chapter is basically providing you with a handful of raw ingredients, and you can take the time to buy some additional spices and toppings to make a fantastic dish, or take what was given and make a satisfying but not delicious meal. Harshnag can be thrown in at various locations, ranging from specific: Waterdeep or its surrounding region, to broad: The vast Spine of the World to the North. He's a huge frost giant with a reputation, so you can use that to your advantage by having him be unique in that he could conceivably travel through towns/cities without issue. But generally, since the next step after finding Harshnag is to head to the Temple, it makes sense to try and filter your party towards the North, and have him be encountered there in some form."
stormkingsthunder,Mostly because the Dwarves are on the side of “good” and after more than a couple rounds your PCs might think it’s a full combat and fight to the death. The module also makes it harder and harder to persuade the dwarves if they keep fighting.
stormkingsthunder,"Sounds interesting! Do you have any specific questions about rules or just looking for cool tips or things to throw into the encounter? Since they are two intelligent mounts, they act on their own initiative and the PCs/NPCs on board are pretty much simply along for the ride rather than actually mounting anything. 

If the PC *doesn't* have a consistent ranged attack, you can make checks for them to stay on, maybe taking some splash damage from the breath weapons, or an acrobatic check to jump onto Clarion and fight the Dwarf on board. 

The combat shouldn't last too long, anything past 2 or 3 rounds and things start to get dicey imo - but you can of course kill all the dwarves and clarion, Felgolos and Zephyros are very powerful."
dndmemes,I love set items! Are there any more that require 2 attunement items (like hammer of thunderbolts)? Was thinking of making a set for each PHB race
Dimension20,"No you're right - they are free to watch live and for about a week afterwards on VOD, but after that get put behind the subscriber paywall. Unfortunately there's nothing you can do at the moment to get them free, you'll just have to wait and hope they put them out if/when Junior year spins up again."
northernlion,"Still not sure why they ever switched off boardgames - it's some of the most perfect content, there are hundreds of games that are lighter and don't require full concentration or even co-op games where everyone is together. You're literally just hanging out and bantering while playing a game with mostly the same perspective."
northernlion,"Thanks, I think I’ll try thievery then since it sounds relatively straight forward? Not a huge fan of killing vendors since I like to play a good guy, though my origin character doesn’t seem scrupulous, so maybe a bit of killing is fine."
northernlion,did malf not follow instructions
northernlion,"> Focus on gear, as without level appropriate gear your characters will die too soon to kill any enemies. For gear, stealing and killing NPCs is not a bad option.

Is it doable for a new solo player to get gear without stealing or killing NPCs? Like, is it feasible or is the expected behavior to kill vendors and yoink their gear?"
DungeonWorld,Yes I believe when you add +bonds you see how many active bonds you have with the relevant person/creature. Typically I’ve  found it to be one or two but I haven’t played that much DW.
dungeondraft,Twitch.tv/highrollersdnd
boardgames,"I'm confused - are your nonbasic lands still mountains after your Magus of the Moon is a 3/3? If so, what's the point of turning that creature into a 3/3 if the ability still goes off?"
northernlion,"Nice! Is it playable for 3? My friends and I have started doing a TUTTY tournament on the weekends with TTS, would love to include this"
stormkingsthunder,"Quite difficult in my opinion. I don't believe there's anything in the book that gives that info to the players until perhaps the Eye of the All Father or the Maelstrom itself. Your players can possibly discover more information before that of course, but it would have to be through their own volition and want to search out more information.

By right most players won't really know that the Storm Giants control or command the other giants or hold court until very late. If you want to give them more information, I would suggest using Giant NPCs, scholars about GIantkin or have the players themselves research it in a library. It will be difficult to not have it be a full lore dump, but you can tease it out over several sessions as there is a fair bit of information about Giants then Storm Giants and then finally Hekaton and his family.

Others have posted about having Iymrith bring news to Zephyros about Hekaton's disappearance, and other ways to introduce/foreshadow Iymrith and the Kraken Society."
Dimension20,I love this show so god damn much
Dimension20,Fucking Adaine & Aelwyn scenes are so good
northernlion,"Might be the wrong place to ask but since you seem to know a lot about D:OS2 I figured I'd try

How do you approach the game single-player? I picked an origin character but the rest of my party are also origin characters, am I meant to look at it as a main character + sidekicks kind of deal or is the entire party equal?

I get huge analysis paralysis in these games, get overwhelmed and then stop because there are too many options or I want to optimise (poorly) without experiencing the game normally. Do you have any tips to avoid that? All I read are ways to pickpocket or barter to get the most gold so I can combine X and Y and get Z skill, which makes me just want to not play at all."
Diablo,If possible it would be awesome to use on Youtube for my DND sessions. Thank you!
boardgames,We did the same thing! 3+ board games a week on Tabletop Simulator. At first it was just to get some playtime on TTS and learn some new games but it ended up being super fun and we just wrapped up the first “season” yesterday!
northernlion,Malf is a god gamer
stormkingsthunder,"Can't give anything concrete as I'm only just about to run Grudd Haug, however those seem like solid ideas. Keep in mind that they can typically assault the structure in a variety of ways, so keep an open mind with how your players decide to approach each lair. 

Also, depending on your party and your decisions, the party only need to go to *one* lair, so spending time thinking of  specific mechanics and actions for the lairs could go to waste. You can always change it or the players may have other hooks to go to the different lairs, but by the book, once they grab the Conch from one lair, they won't need to go to the others.

You can also swap out some of the monsters/giants for environment appropriate things if you feel like plowing through 10 Hill Giants or whatever is too boring."
highrollersdnd,"Yes that is true - I was operating under the assumption they used something like Zoom or Google Meet which doesn't, I believe, allow for individual audio attenuation like Discord/Mumble. They also had issues with Katie's mic which they couldn't seem to fix on Trott's end."
highrollersdnd,"He said in chat during stream he was using vMix which I believe is a broadcasting/production tool to handle multiple feeds and allows for built in transitions like the DNDBeyond ad. I don’t know what they used to video conference however, and I don’t know if he could adjust individual audio feeds on the fly either."
Roll20,Thank you for making it gridless! Do you have the intended dimensions for each map?
boardgames,It's so good! I've always played it privately with friends but I decided to branch out into open games and i've learnt quite a few new games. People are *mostly* quite friendly and welcoming.

LivestreamFail,"I mean that’s really my aim with Diablo anyway, if I get a solid week of mind numbing mob smashing insanity and the numbers keep going up then I’m satisfied. I have so many other games to play that jumping back into D3 once every 3 months is fun."
stormkingsthunder,"Is the campaign ending after the final battle? Why make your players work so hard (and potentially get downed/die?) after the entire campaign? I guess if you are continuing after and want them to really work for some hard-earned treasure, but if the campaign is literally ending right after I don't see why you can't just shower them in gold and magic items and then call it a day."
malaysia,Absolutely do not go or plan for this happening. The situation can escalate drastically within the next few weeks and even if it stays the same it would not be a good idea. The fact that the quarantine *doesnt*apply makes it an even worse idea since you risk spreading it once you’re home.
dndnext,"That was my impression as well. Not necessarily ""slogs"", but gruelling battles that you never come out of unscathed. I watch some Adam Koebel stuff and that while I don't have the most experience with DW, I was under the impression he likes his combat to be very deadly and difficult, so it would be strange to me if his own RPG was a walk in the park as far as combat is concerned."
dndnext,Is immortal heroes breezing through battles really the concept for DW/PBTA? I thought all combat is deadly and you risk death at every corner - the opposite of being legendary heroes crushing through their enemies
northernlion,NL slinging heat at the start of the week
DescentintoAvernus,"Was looking forward to this! I got really disheartened after reading the Alexandrian’s latest set of tweets. My party isn’t even in Elturel yet and I feel like I have so much work cut out for me. Hopefully I can transform this module into something fun and enjoyable. 

The set pieces, characters and environments are awesome it’s just tying everything together and having a core conceit that isn’t just the players along for the ride.

Thanks for putting this out!"
highrollersdnd,"Crazy fight! Those are easily some of the hardest battles to run as a DM but I think Mark pulled it off flawlessly. Rhi was awesome with her inspiring speeches and I can’t wait to see her encounter new/old guardians. 

The escape was nailbiting and both anti-climactic and exhilarating at the same time. What a bummer if they had succeeded in getting the Prime Matrix only for Sentry to just die right there lmao"

DescentintoAvernus,"That’s funny since I’m running SKT as well! I suppose you’re right though, without more padding or side quest stuff SKT really blows by once you start clearing a Giant Lair"

dndnext,"This seems like a huge oversight - I think the $8 discount is only meant to apply to a singular item. That being said, I hope they honor the orders!"
DescentintoAvernus,How have you found the pacing to be from 7-11? Do they blow past quickly in relation to a normal material plane adventure?

DnD,Most published campaigns take you to around 11th level. They typically take about a year or year and a half to get through. Just in time for your group to pick up the next one!
dndnext,"I can recommend [World Forge](https://allmylinks.com/worldforgepodcast) and [Filling in the Gaps](https://open.spotify.com/show/20TaA7LilQWHSiDLskNw8x?si=jdk0KitgTGmm83ObrJi6wA) though I'm not sure in FITG is still on-going. They are both shows that are mostly for DMs and build off prompts either through a table or a listener. They then create a scenario or come up with various NPCs or monsters, and talk about different concepts DMs can use to enhance their game.

Thanks for the thread, discovered several really cool podcasts I didn't know existed!"
DescentintoAvernus,Dungeondraft?
HadesTheGame,Pretty sure they’ve done that multiple times
videos,"Forgotten Realms, or Faerun specifically, though with the Gith involved perhaps it spreads outside of Toril. A lot of D&D monsters and races have a strong connection to the Forgotten Realms but not all of them, so it would be a mistake to label this as entirely D&D lore. It’s just one hugely popular, and default, setting for D&D"
criticalrole,hope he takes on a texan accent
Games,"Totally in the same boat! I can’t wait, this looks amazing"
DMAcademy,"Hey man, it’s going to be rough mostly because it seems like you and your players, or just the paladin, have different expectations about what you are getting together to do. It’s good that you didn’t double down and force them down the content you had prepped, so great start! 

A session 0 is good, but only if you know the questions you want to ask, and your own answers. If they are dead set on just having a romp around a fantasy world and don’t want consequences, then that’s the game they want to play. It’s a lot more light-hearted, comedic and can get insane really fast, but it’s not unlike some improv podcasts out there. If you are adamant you want to play your module and have a more structured game, then you will either have to compromise or get a new group.

Jumping into DND and DMing for the first time is incredibly and will take time and maybe some hard lessons before you find your feet. Keep trying and you’ll definitely find the right group for you!"
northernlion,"Obviously all speculation but I think NL has cultivated a very unique community through his stream format. Most streamers are either variety or a single competitive game, but neither typically have set formats. They usually just spin up the stream, maybe at a specific schedule, and play the games they play. NLSS viewers have dockets and a very strict schedule of ~3 hours. I think this cultivates a much more engaged audience as we are anticipating new games and actively looking for information regarding it.

I can only speak for myself when I say I look for the megathread to see the games that were played, or his twitter to see if he is starting up a new series on YouTube. This probably translated into CoF where he actively promoted it leading up to it. I don't really watch the other streamers aside from Hafu so I don't know how much promoting they did or didn't, but my assumption would be their community was simply unaware of what was happening, they just thought the streamer was offline for that day."
northernlion,Let’s *actually* go
stormkingsthunder,"About 8-10 sessions before I introduced Harshnag and they headed off to the Temple. Keep in mind however that Chapter 3 represents more than just an interstitial between the first giant attack and the introduction of Harshnag. You'll very likely be jumping back to those locations for the rest of the adventure. While the airship and teleportation circles help speed up travel, there will still be a couple days where you'll have to go on horseback.

Don't feel the need to stretch it out to a few dozen sessions for the sake of it, especially if you're struggling to think up your own quests to get them to different locations."
boardgames,"Thanks for the recs! Arboretum looks perfect and right down our alley, thanks 🙏"
boardgames,"Do you guys have any suggestions for games best suited for 3 players? Looking mostly competitive or anything that can determine placements as we’ve been having a lot of fun with a mini-tournament style boardgame session every week. It’s been a ton of fun just learning new boardgames and finding which types we prefer. 

Just played Splendor and love games like Machi Koro or Sushi Go!"
DescentintoAvernus,"Ah that’s awesome! Yeah I don’t think I’d ever play that module from start to finish, but the singular dungeons seem fun. Were they all related to each other or would I be able to pull them out without any issue?"
DescentintoAvernus,Did you guys do the entirety of Mad Mage? I’ve heard it’s quite a slog without anything else in between
DnD,"There's also a similar section in Xanathar's Guide to Everything! Giving this a skim, it looks like this was the preview for it, so I'm not sure if there's a whole lot of new information. But if you already have the book, check it out!"
dndnext,"I agree. If anything, low level fights are some of the most dangerous. It might feel silly but your characters are fighting for their life here! Their hearts would be pounding and ears ringing at the sound of battle.

That being said, there are plenty of generic tracks available with a lower tempo or ambient music that doesn’t have a big “drop” or developing sequence of sound. Kevin Macleod and Midnight Syndicate are good places to start."
northernlion,what the fuck stop
dndnext,"Wholeheartedly agree. 5E's trickle of sourcebooks and adventures has ultimately been a great boon for them because it makes almost any official content devoured by a voracious player base. I wasn't a RPG player back in 3/3.5 or AD&D but from what I've read around the subreddit/twitter, it sounds like an official book was being churned out nearly every month. Now you have a wealth of 3rd party creators that are propped up by this release schedule, getting more attention as players look for more content.

The only downside to it is that any major book released that isn't spectacular will be a big disappointment and could fuel resentment towards future products. Bad or mediocre adventures are one thing but if the next Xanathar's isn't as good as the first one, I think you'll see a lot of people start to grow restless and look elsewhere.

But that's not really a bad thing. D&D is great and 5E is still my primary system but thanks to it I have been exposed to a number of wonderful RPG systems that I can play if I ever get bored of what WOTC releases. It would suck if 5E declines and they can't recover the same popularity, but I will always be a RPG player thanks to D&D."
dndnext,"Not for a long, long time anyway. If the game is still growing and gaining new blood, why bother? It only makes sense to do a refresh when the market is stagnant and players want something new."
lfg,Are you looking to join a group or have a solo session along with running meta commentary and things like that?
monsteraday,"Oh baby yes! This is exactly what I need for my next session. I had an idea of having the Dragon Cult Airship from SKT be an encounter rather than a transportation device, and while the human cultists man the ballistae, they also have several flying kobolds and kobold inventors on board as well, since they all serve an Ancient Red Dragon!

This will be handy as a lieutenant type to throw in there and try and grapple some casters off their own ship."
stormkingsthunder,"Oddly enough my group totally defended Triboar fairly easily as well. In hindsight I played it a little poorly, I think the smart thing to do would be to narrate the action up til the characters decide where to place themselves and then set up different combat encounters based on that. 

Instead I used the large map on roll20 and had placed the tokens down and rolled initiative. What followed was an extremely long and drawn out combat of dashes as both forces had to cross over 500 ft on roads. I also had the orcs and mephits mostly distracted and attacking buildings and setting fire to things, as well as fighting NPCs.

The giants themselves were strong, and could probably have taken on the party by themselves, but I made the priority the vonindod fragment, so they only attacked when a party member blocked their way. They managed to kill one and the other fled along with the rest of the remaining orcs."
DnD,"Depends what you want to get out of the adventures. 

Tomb is probably the most 'complete' adventure in that it features a wholly new area and is mostly about the adventure itself without much supplemental content. 

Mad Mage is a huge dungeon crawl that can be handy to pull from as a DM, but maybe not the most exciting adventure to go from beginning to end with. 

Dragon Heist is a short 1st - 5th level adventure but features several different paths/villains to replay the second half of the adventure with, along with supplemental information about Waterdeep and some ideas on how to run encounters within a City.

I would also caution against SCAG but if you're set on it then go for it!"
DMAcademy,"That’s awesome! RIP Tree bro.

Harper agent leading to Inner circles is smart. I wanted the teleportation circles to be significant so I had to come up with travel and road encounters up to that point. The book doesn’t give nearly as many random encounters as you want so that was the most prep on my end.

Others have already mentioned Kraken’s Gambit, which I only heard of after, but I read through Power Score’s guide and they mentioned the need to foreshadow it since as you say the book pulls both groups out of thin air. When they arrived in Yartar I seeded some rumours and they actually met Khesper Drylund through a gladiatorial victory. 

For Klauth, I mentioned his roar saved Bryan Shander from pure destruction and the frost giants peaced out. I also had a character spot him and his airship flying alongside each other. At the end of this session I swapped out the dragon cultist encounter for a NPC and ex-PC who both had proclivities for exploration and tinkering - they had been recruited by Silverymoon to patrol the skies and protect from giant attacks. I’ll have one of the encounters wherever they head to next be against the dragon cultists!"
DMAcademy,"Ah right! I did not give my players the Goldenfields quest and then fortuitously had the NPCs at Triboar lead them through a ‘connect-the-dots’ style quest through Yartar to Everlund. That took a good 5-6 sessions and I managed to sprinkle in some foreshadowing here and there. 

We’ve just left the temple and are hurtling towards a Giant’s Laid in the next 4 sessions!"
DMAcademy,"Getting sidetracked is half the point of Chapter 3! The giant threat is not written as a time crunch, although you can certainly narrate it that way, so if your players are having fun doing random tasks along the Sword Coast then have at it! There really isn’t too much plot critical things until Harshnag and they even say you can plop that down pretty much anytime/anywhere"
HeyRiddleRiddle,"Baby, baby




Crab Rangoon"
dndmaps,"Thank you for providing a gridless map! I had to convert it to JPG as it was too large for free Roll20, but this saved me a huge chunk of time, thanks!"
stormkingsthunder,"Ah well at least there's a happy ending! SKT definitely has some problems with overall layout and the way they present the information, but I think with a little bit of work it can be a really great adventure.

Saltmarsh seems awesome too, so I hope you have a lot of fun with that!"
stormkingsthunder,"Wow, that's really surprising to hear. Was the group having fun up til then? Did you guys just move on to another module or break up after?"
stormkingsthunder,"Wow, the detail on both of them is incredible! What printer did you use?"
totalwar,As in 2020.
Roll20,Ooh this looks so good!
MMA,hey man when you just start and some rando runs up to you on his epic mount and just dumps 100g on you... that changes a man
mobilelegends,"Thanks! I’ll checkout the ones you mentioned. Akai is pretty easy so I’ve been having a good time, but it is annoying when you initiate and no one goes in with you and you just die lol"
dndnext,Thank you!
mobilelegends,"What tanks do you recommend from a soloQ? I just picked it up again and bought Akai, mostly play him when there’s no tank in Ranked"
dndnext,Do you have a tweet/page number for that glass bit? Never knew that!
northernlion,"Thanks for the hard work! Loving the Golden Goblet series but don't really have the time to watch all three, so this is super handy."
stormkingsthunder,"The Harshnag encounter is the big dial that you as the DM can choose to adjust as you desire. The book essentially says you can let them meet Harshnag whenever you want, so if you have a bunch of ideas and want to romp in the open world after the giant attack at 5th level, then feel free!

Don’t feel beholden to sticking to 6th level either. The giant liars are huge, filled with giants and not exactly a cakewalk for 8th level characters. It’s not absurd to have the party be 9th or 10th level by that point and if you want you can always add more monsters.

Once you trigger Harshnag and the Temple, you then get one last chance to explore the open world a bit, adding in distractions or side quests along the path to the burial mounds. There are many and your players may pick one and choose to head back, or you can entice them to explore more of them."
Roll20,"That's a really good idea, thanks! 

I've used the map idea before, when I can't get the grids to line up properly in Roll20 but I really like the map. Do you have any good workshop submissions you use? I use mostly the Forgotten Adventure ones since they have a consistent style, but I'm always looking for more!"
Roll20,"Lovely! I’ve had DPS for a while but I really suck at it. I have a hard time visualising what I want and just get kind of stumped. When I finally settle on something it looks really dreadful and I feel like I wasted a bunch of time. Love the blend work, the river especially!"
NoahGetTheBoat,Original three photos are from @tamoorh
northernlion,well now i wanna know what it said!
dogswithjobs,"This is such a wholesome thread! I hope your dog’s tooth is alright and everything turns out great, they are super cute."
HadesTheGame,Rock of Ages 3
giantbomb,I emailed them about it last year and they said it was my podcast app. Haven’t found a solution trying 5 different apps so I just listen to Spotify now
giantbomb,"I mean, sure, but when Premium is consistently late for whatever reason it should be something looked into."
apolloapp,Yeah it started happening with Tweetbot as well. Restart seemed to fix for now
apolloapp,"Same, it happens to any external link that prompts the internal browser but not image viewer.

I couldn't get your fix to work though, I have to kill the app and restart and then open the link in chrome instead."
stormkingsthunder,"There is a featured encounter in Chapter 3 about a Cloud Giant Castle attack in Waterdeep. It's not too fleshed out but that would definitely be the type of giant to attack. Either that or some rogue Storms coming out of the sea, but that could have some mixed messaging in the future."
giantbomb,"I don’t think that many CRPGs have co-op like Divinity, but I’ve heard Tyranny is fairly short?"
northernlion,+1 for Piggies
MMA,The small hand motion he did to go along with it is fucking fantastic
northernlion,holy SHIT
Games,"You'll definitely get the best experience once they launch. The update prior to this worked on new player experience in preparation for their steam launch and it felt fantastic. I don't think that aspect will change much but with the amount of content that is slowly introduced through the start it was hard to tell what was intentionally obscured and what was just early access locked off. 

It's still fun to play alongside development but if you're not into that or interested in replaying to see the differing content then waiting is definitely the best option."
highrollersdnd,Episode 32
CasualUK,holy shit poor brad muir
Games,"Yes, the soundtrack is incredible! I like all of Supergiant’s OSTs but Transistor has such an ethereal sound to it. I also prefer the vocal tracks to the instrumentals, Paper Boats is fantastic."
giantbomb,"Had the same feeling. But of a shame that people don’t seem to like Malus. I had a blast with Snikch and Repanse so it was definitely money well spent on my end. 

I’m looking forward to the next pack and the WH3 announcement! It’s a daunting task but if they manage to sandwich all 3 maps in without huge compromise it will be an amazing achievement. It’ll probably be a year+ down the line after the initial games release though so I’m not holding my breath for anything groundbreaking from the start."
northernlion,Hades
HadesTheGame,No there’s no benefit to going up multiple heat levels I believe.
highrollersdnd,Was the 100 damage from a roll or flat damage? You mentioned a similar effect from artifacts in the DMG?
dndnext,Any suggestions or opinions on the bundles available?
dndnext,"They usually do a big blowout media event for their campaigns though, unless it's something like a TftYP or Saltmarsh where it's more of an anthology series than a full length campaign."
Games,"That’s insanely shortsighted since Riot paid streamers to play TFT, adding a compounding effect for other streamers to jump on the most ‘popular’ game. TFT is definitely the most popular but you can’t just look at the twitch numbers and link it 1:1."
HadesTheGame,"Yeah, I always lose em to the lava in Asphodel"
HadesTheGame,"Greater recall just means it seeks back to you, still good but they don’t instantly pop out"
highrollersdnd,"Awesome, thank you!"
highrollersdnd,I don't think there are enough posts to warrant a clamp down. It is slightly annoying when it's just post after post of the same joke but that can't really be helped.
giantbomb,his Call a Friend would be his Dad and it would cost him the million dollar question
giantbomb,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7O2EZBbkms

should be here?"
giantbomb,"This is REALLY high up there for me. Abby's face and off-mic ""DAAAAAAAAAN DANNNNNNNNN"" really seals it along with Dan thinking REALLY hard about the origins of butter."
northernlion,"This was such a fantastic and brilliant idea, so props to whoever pitched it and got everyone on board. I think it only got better and proved itself as a great idea with each week, so having another season would be super exciting.

I agree with /u/Gawr that having it be more Survivor-esque rather than Big Brother makes sense, especially if you're beholden to the idea of two teams. That, along with a few more players and it would increase the meta game layer exponentially.  I also think having another person to do rules clarification would help immensely as it felt like K8 had to run around and repeat herself multiple times.

To the season itself: I think most people predicted Baer to win if he managed to secure a Final Two spot, and it bore out. Dan did a great job in playing the moderator and stoking the fire a bit, but ultimately Austin shot himself in the foot with his reasoning to Ryan. I still don't quite understand Dan's draft, as it was more of an effort to break up a ""ride or die"" pair with MALF/Ryan that proved a much bigger negative in the long run, and having the better ball players would have at least meant he could break them up without blood on his hands. As it stood, both MALF and Rob were salty at the imbalance of power and likely wouldn't have voted for Dan if he wriggled his way to the final two so it wouldn't have benefited him anyway."
giantbomb,Times like these I wish the beastcast was filmed
giantbomb,"I’m expecting a lot less “combined” videos since they were only there a week compared to two, so even a day free isn’t really going to add much. But Vinny said there was a bunch of personal videos going up so I’m curious to know what that means."
totalwar,Anyone getting performance drops since the patch? I was generally fine except during end turn scrolls but I’ve been noticing severe drops during the menu transitions like selecting a new army or settlement. During battle it’s generally fine
Games,"Hi!

Would this be a good product to jump into the world of Vampire the Masquerade? I’ve only seen bits of the tabletop game being played online but Bloodlines 2 has gotten me interested, I’d just like to know the lore and world a bit more!"
giantbomb,"Total War: Warhammer 2. It didn’t come out this year but it’s definitely the game I’ve spent the most time with this year. The amount of content in this game is truly staggering and it’s opened up an entire genre of game for me. 

Creative Assembly have captured lightning in a bottle by combining their strategy expertise with the fantasy world. It feels like the culmination of all their experience coming to the fore and the final game in the trilogy is something I’m dearly looking forward to."
giantbomb,INCREDIBLE TEAM PLAY
giantbomb,Really? I feel like they must have loosened their restrictions drastically since a few years ago because they have a dedicated Podcasts section now and I can find almost any random podcast with like 2 episodes on there
LivestreamFail,"A phone is used for a multitude of applications, and most of these people are working part-time or are a delivery driver so they have hours of downtime but aren’t just sitting at home, so they play games on their phone while they wait for their next gig."
giantbomb,Ron’s laugh gives me life
dndnext,A Red Dragon
Roll20,"Also good to note that he has access to everything on roll20 I believe, from marketplace assets to compendium books, as well as the benefits of a Pro subscription of course. He plays it mostly by the book, so default 5E sheet and few custom macros and stuff, so it's a great look at both new DND modules as well as the dynamic lighting that gets built into them."
Dimension20,Chat was super annoying during the whole thing. I know it was mostly hyperbole but there was some really nasty shit being said even in jest
stormkingsthunder,"Grab a prep book from Valeur or Power Score so you know at least the basic summary. I found reading the entire module very taxing because there were just dozens of different interwoven threads that the players may never touch. 

I would work with your players closely when creating characters to make sure they have good motivations outside of the main plot, because having locations to visit that are of interest to the players will be extremely helpful in moving chapter 3 along organically."
giantbomb,He’s trapped in the Underlords Mines
dndnext,Has that been sunsetted? No new episodes since August
highrollersdnd,Strong eyelash game from those priestesses
totalwar,I was almost about to destroy Clan Mors before they somehow united the Dwarfs against me! I’ve spent the last 80 turns eradicating the Dawi along their mountain range and the Vampire Counts have sandwiched them up against Karaz-a-Karak now
totalwar,The best part is even within the races itself. I finished up a Tehenhauin Vortex campaign when that DLC dropped and started up a Kroq-gar ME campaign and they couldn’t be more different. I was barely scrapping by fending off three or four challengers in the jungles of Lustria but in the old world I have a nice small corner to wage war against Skaven and their Dwarven allies
formula1,Me too! Listened to a f1 podcast casually for a few years but never actually tried to watch. Caught every race and almost every quali this season.
giantbomb,Fuck you just reminded I have to finish FE...
highrollersdnd,Thank you for the hard work!
giantbomb,Melon
giantbomb,I could think of one worse thing...
highrollersdnd,So brave
dndnext,"Have you given thought to Lost Mine of Phandelver or the adventure included in the new Essentials Kit: Dragon of Icespire Peak? You could even combine those to create a larger space so you don't necessarily have your players complete every task or quest.

I'm nearing the end of LMOP and its been a blast so far, and it really gives you good guidance as a first time DM, something that you wouldn't get with any of the other modules."
giantbomb,"Super excited for this. I wasn't as into CSD 2 as the first game but the trailer for this one was absolutely wild, and the changes Chubigan s has brought to the game seem awesome. I might try it out with gamepad!"
theouterworlds,"holy fuck this saved me, thank you!"
dndnext,"Ah very cool. I was just afraid I had misunderstood something, but that makes a lot of sense, thanks!"

DescentintoAvernus,Thank you for showing off a preview of the maps and splitting up the resources into chunks rather than one big book - my party is transitioning from LMOP straight into Avernus (with a brief stop at Candlekeep) so this is going to be really useful.
DescentintoAvernus,"Highly recommend you take a look at [Highrollers' playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEFIkeOszws&list=PLHv5CBoZYv4UQVe3bX9_SmDF3QQAQmaZZ). Some  context: It's a continuation of their first campaign, 4 of the characters aren't from the Forgotten Realms and they start at 15th(I think) level. The DM is also running it off a preview copy, so things may differ from the module. Lastly, I imagine he homebrewed a lot of the interstitial encounters and plucked some key stuff, but it's a great look at what some Tier 4 play could look like in Avernus."
giantbomb,Fuck I love watching Abby and Mike get scared but I get way too tense and scared watching it
giantbomb,Truly closer to becoming his dad every day
lfg,I’m keen! I’ve played DW before for a few sessions but the group fizzled out after the GM took an extended break. I’m GMT+8 and I’m available on Mondays.
BorderlandsBuilds,Check out sin tee’s immortal hellcat build. That has a bunch in brawl along with Guardian Angel.
lfg,"Hi! I’m interested, could you tell me a little more about the campaign? Will it be homebrew or a module?

A little about myself: I’m primarily a DM with a almost 2 years of experience playing DND. I’m currently running a Storm King’s Thunder and LMOP campaign that will transition into the new Descent into Avernus module. I’ve been looking for a game to just kick back and play during the week."
highrollersdnd,To add on she also mentions later that she would have pulled out anyway because she didn’t feel it was right to use Tiangong’s power for that type of activity
stormkingsthunder,"Thank you! I think this sums up my feelings the best. I never want combat encounters to feel like filler content but at the same time it's a lot of work planning out encounters (social or otherwise) that have meaningful interactions.

My terrain descriptions are also one of my weakest points so I feel like I flounder a lot when I don't have an encounter prepped and have nothing to really do while travelling. My players are great but I can't rely on them to RP when there isn't much to talk about."
Borderlands,Off topic but do you know where the crit points are on the bigger mechs? Like the Centurion? I crit it a couple times but still couldn’t really pinpoint where it is
giantbomb,"Just finished two nights ago, going through the side quests I missed. I really hope they add an option to skip cutscenes/extraneous dialogue because I’ve already turned down the volume and just listen to music most of the time. 

It’s a good game and the gameplay is a shocking improvement from BL2, which I already really enjoyed. I struggled to play 2 solo but 3 is a blast with or without friends. Cooperation mode is a welcome addition and I’m glad they’re starting to patch things both performance and balance wise."

Roll20,"Wow, it looks awesome! Did you use the deck/card function to make those player portraits?"
giantbomb,hope you're better now buddy
stormkingsthunder,"Sounds like a great opportunity! Othovir is pretty secretive so if Garthog doesn’t hide his Margaster roots he could be dubious about the quest.

He could also just end up giving the information to another party member, with vague enough detail that Garthog would only realise when they’re in Silverymoon.

It’s a great RP moment to prep for their reunion and whether or not they unite against the larger Margaster family in Waterdeep or fight it out amongst themselves."
giantbomb,they are legit good and as someone that doesn't really keep up with GB content daily it helps me out a fair deal. I wish he could teleport to the NY office and film some there but oh well. I managed to catch some impromptu livestream Beast did with Abby opening a box of Frosted Flakes/Tonys so maybe they are doing more stuff soon!
giantbomb,Social Media intern Rorie has been killing it on the gram lately
highrollersdnd,"I think a second level dip would be good just for Portent, but his stats aren’t amazing and he’d do well to pump his main spellcasting ability to 20. I’ve never multiclassed two spellcasting classes before so I don’t know if there’s any cool/weird things you can do with spell slots. At the very least he can start collecting rituals to continue to supplement his out of combat utility."

giantbomb,"Love the Heave-Ho segment! It showcased such a different style of play compared to the QL. You can really get some insane momentum individually and get a fair distance without having to link up arms, but that method works well too!"
DnD,"Hearty recommendation for High Rollers! I fell off the early episodes of Aerois but the last two chapters drew me back in and I’m now going back through the backlog. The cast is fantastic and Rhiannon is a wonderful addition to the cast. 

Mark is a pretty underrated GM, and I’d say his greatest strength is world building. Aerois is incredible and the different lowland continents contrast beautifully, while keeping a sense of cohesion throughout. 

The groups dynamic is very fun and light, though it isn’t without its serious moments."

giantbomb,Don’t.
Dimension20,I would love for them to play a more relaxed game of DND. The setpieces are amazing but I think it’d be cool to see a less hyper-focused game.
fireemblem,Ooh now I get it! I kept getting that dialogue and was worried I had picked a bad meal. It didn’t help that the A support was locked behind the timeskip so I got it like 3-4 times.
LivestreamFail,They had 4 days of round robin Bo2 group stages to seed prior to this
DMAcademy,"It was beyond bad. 

I had no real concept of what D&D was or how it was played, and I prepped very little. I used the free module on Roll20, The Master’s Vault I think? I relied way too much on roll20’s roll system to carry me through and was basically just reading off the handouts given without any changes. 

It took me another year+ and watching some critical role and other live plays for me to try again."
highrollersdnd,Yeah but Mark was still rolling saves for him and it ended up being 2-3. They were pretty wrapped up with combat so I don’t think it was too bad.
underlords,Yeah lemme just whip one up rq
giantbomb,"Absolutely! I used to consume everything, then found myself prioritising East Coast content, and now I just catch up on select premium series or QLs that really grab me. It sucks, but at the same time our interests are always shifting, and it'd be strange to stick with something for so long especially if you aren't enjoying it."
criticalrole,"It is a ruling from Crawford, the game's designer: https://www.sageadvice.eu/2018/01/29/does-the-breath-weapon-go-through-leomunds-tiny-hut/

Tiny Hut only blocks spells, magical effects and objects. It would depend on how you rule a Dragon's breath, whether it is part of them or innately magical. He says it isn't magical, so it goes through. It can vary per DM choice, obviously."

lfg,"Oh weird, says [Removed] for me! And yes, my current campaign is fortnightly so I’d want to stick with that at the very least. It’s my first time running it and it’s pretty dense, but I think once I get to grips with it it’s a fairly customisable open world that can be run a multitude of ways"
lfg,Why’d the original post get removed? I’m currently in the middle of a SKT campaign and I’d be happy to talk more about running a bi-weekly session for your group if you’re interested
giantbomb,I wouldve had Dan as Spunky but Alex as Filburt is fucking priceless
lfg,"What modules have you played, and what happened to your last DM?"
facepalm,From illegal companies set up by Chinese businessmen who recycle or straight up burn the plastics they get in a fire pit and call it a day
giantbomb,"holy shit

there were some pretty boring episodes in the middle there but Crime Crew really delivered that patented Open World Jank^tm that I expected. The first 4 or 5 episodes and these last 2 have been amazing."
northernlion,Is it basically darkest dungeon?
Roll20,"very cool! any asset websites you pull from, or just compiled from various places?"
underlords,"Yes, you’re comparing a flat bleed vs % damage. That’s why knights, mages and warlocks are so strong and only get stronger."
Roll20,"Where did you make the factions coat of arms/banners?

It looks really sweet!"
Games,"I fell off both Awakening and Fates, putting in a couple dozen or so hours into Awakening and much less into Fates. I was still interested in this one however, but it wasn’t until it came out and I saw the effusive praise that I picked it up. 

I’ve been really enjoying it and while there are still areas where I’m scared to not be doing the optimal path, there’s just too much to worry about to really mind. The only thing that irks me at the moment is the support gating. I wanted to get Leonie on my team but I can’t B support her until I progress through the story (I assume post-timeskip). Same goes for Mercedes and Annette. It’s just slightly annoying because it makes me spend less time with them than I otherwise would so I’m not wasting support points and activity points on them, which is a shame. I wish the points would carry over through levels."
giantbomb,"Gotcha, I'm still a couple chapters from the timeskip, but I will definitely play through the other houses in NG+ or whatever new game options they have. ^^^^Black ^^^^Eagles ^^^^will ^^^^be ^^^^the ^^^^last ^^^^one ^^^^though"
giantbomb,"Aren’t the missions the same? Like when you go to quell Lonato and Miklan’s uprising, yknow... the Blue Lion-adjacent guys? 🦁"
giantbomb,BLUE LION GANG REPRESENT
criticalrole,F
giantbomb,"Vinny, Abby, Dan: *franctically dodging, driving and shooting*

Alex:"
giantbomb,Why is Dan always in completely different weather compared to the rest of the crew?
dndnext,"Ah this is so great! I liked the starter map but always had to reference the larger SKT map for nearby towns and settlements. This will make incorporating the essentials kit way easier, thanks!"
formula1,KVYATTTT
northernlion,austin lookin like a regular ol' gendo right here
giantbomb,"Nah I don't think so, you can see how bewildered Dan and Mike Mahardy were at her proficiency. She just blew through the first bits of the game without even dying let alone facing massive challenges."
giantbomb,Amazing
giantbomb,Alex selecting the Skull Raid mission and then wondering why it’s taking him into Skull Enemy territory is a fun exercise
stormkingsthunder,"Your tweaks and character inclusions are so good! My party just finished Zephyros' tower and arrived at Triboar too, let me know how the two encounters on the castle go"
stormkingsthunder,"I've been trying to find one too, but I think in general your experience with the adventure will vary wildly depending on your group and how much you incorporate their backstory. The middle section is just wide open for interpretation and can go as long or as short as you want."
northernlion,Weird username bro
northernlion,cursed
lfg,"No, EST is GMT -4 so it'd be 4am."
giantbomb,cut the mustard
conan,One of the best intros
giantbomb,"Holy shit, this guy plays fighting games"
giantbomb,I’m losing my fucking miiiiind
giantbomb,"BARKERVILLE 
HOWL TO THE MOON"
giantbomb,"I think going from 99 to Effect will be more beneficial than vice versa, since Effect was somewhat challenging near the end, but you should have honed those skills in 99. It’ll also be an amazing cleanser and meditation-type game compared to the frantic nature of 99, so I hope you really enjoy it!"
northernlion,Is your name in reference to Daigunder the anime?
giantbomb,"What a short and anti-climactic ""final"" heist! Does anyone know if the Doomsday one is any good? Kind of sad that the series is ending, but it was a good few weeks of hilarious content while it lasted!"
northernlion,GET IN THERE CARLOS
videos,Fantastic work!
giantbomb,"You should really get a flair, Bianca!"
giantbomb,Why isn’t this maniac in prison!
giantbomb,"yesss thank you! It sounded so familiar but I couldn't remember if it was something they mentioned before or I witnessed it happening.

1:27:12 is the timestamp for anyone curious"
giantbomb,"Does anyone have a clip of Dan throwing a coffee bean at Vinny, or was that off camera?"
DnD,"I was somewhat confused when I saw a dog and wolf because I thought the title said the beasts and monsters were homebrew, but I realised my mistake! I've struggled to keep up with Highrollers, but I do like the world a lot and the cast seems to have really settled in lately, so I might go back and catch up. Fantastic work!"
giantbomb,What the fucking fuck is wrong with GTA Online
underlords,"Yeah I'm getting the error too, I'm not sure if the gameplay volume reset as it became somewhat noticeable over my podcast, which is usually not the case. 695.7 MB here"
giantbomb,"Watching it for the first time now, can you tell me how unique the world building or more specifically the mecha “tech” is compared to the other content around that time or even since then? It really struck me how detailed the mech load outs and foundations around it are but I guess I don’t know if they copped a lot of that from older anime or came up with it themselves."
giantbomb,"God damnit, I thought they'd go in 5s or something like they do with MHA, so I thought I was safe with 7 episodes. Now I have to watch one more before bed!"
giantbomb,Airforce Gator Solid when
giantbomb,already dreading this night time listen
MMA,"You're right, sorry!"
MMA,"He risks a lot if he loses as well.

1) he’d be 0-2, 1 NC against a single fighter

2) his HW reign would be tarnished and plagued by the Jones loss. DC has mentioned multiple times that his HW belt was special because it wasn’t attached to Jones at all

3) He’d end his career on a loss, or worse, continue fighting. 

He already has a great set up to retire. If he left on a loss against Jones, his legacy would purely be as a Jon Jones victim."
giantbomb,"Metal Gear Scanlon was a beautiful, beautiful time. In my mind, the entire series is better than any single Endurance Run. The combination of Dan & Drew, with face cams and following the entirety of the insane Metal Gear Solid series alongside Drew was great. MGSV ended the series on a bit of a dour note and ultimately I would've been happy with it ending with 4 and/or Revengeance, but it doesn't take away from the epic nature of the series as a whole. Persona 4 is still the best Endurance Run, but MGScanlon might be the best series Giant Bomb has ever put together."
giantbomb,Was some old school Happy Hour/Tested shit and I’m all for it
giantbomb,Why would I join the jam and wait when I can go so much faster in this lane!
criticalrole,"Yeah loved the after-encounter RP there. It got heated but not to the point where people took it personally or anyone was really ""wrong"". There were sides taken and lines drawn and I can't wait for the next few episodes!"
giantbomb,But the MULTIPLAYER
lfg,Always love seeing more Sprawl games! Sadly this clashes with a DW game I’m in or else I’d sign up. Good luck!
northernlion,F1 looks weird this season
giantbomb,The Chidi of Giant Bomb
giantbomb,HeY rYo!~
stormkingsthunder,"I haven't run it with 2 PCs but like the other poster said giants will hit like a truck, which will be the main danger point for your group. There are also numerous encounters that are dangerous for a group of 4, let alone 2, so you'd at the very least need to halve those encounters as well as strongly advise your PCs that running/avoiding fights will be key."
SubredditDrama,"Me too, let's do it!"
hotones,Padma Lakshmi’s was the bomb!
dndnext,How did you handle battle maps? My big fear is that I'd be largely improvising my way through locations and as a result would come up with encounters on the fly with no resulting battle map. I play online so most players have some expectation of a battle map every few encounters.
criticalrole,It’s probably my favourite addition to the CR production. I just love subtitles and even though I’m not hearing impaired I greatly appreciate the lengths they went to incorporate closed captioning in their show!
Roll20,Wow this is wild. Great work!
giantbomb,"OK good, I was just listening while out for coffee but they went to another question so I wasn't sure. 48,000 is near stadium/arena-level capacities and I just found it extremely weird that Ben didn't stop to consider that the caller was wrong and just went with it."
giantbomb,"Combo Breaker capped attendance at 4,800 not 48,000 Ben Jesus Christ"
MMA,"Yes, he’s friends with Ige"
criticalrole,Do you recreate all the battle maps yourself? Would you mind sharing the files if so? They are incredible!
giantbomb,"Bit of a short episode but filled with good stuff! 

>!Alex slamming into the pavement was pretty good!<"
lfg,Hi Arran! Just confirming you can make the meeting time - we'd be starting around midnight for you and going for 2 or 3 hours. Is that fine?
giantbomb,"Catching up on Nite 3 content and I highly recommend the Brooke Maggs, Luis Antonio and Alex Hutchinson segment. You rarely get guests to take the initiative and ask their own questions. It was so refreshing and I think made the segment a lot more engaging to listen to. 

Jeff is a great interviewer but it's ultimately up to the guests to give compelling answers and he can also end up going around the couch which gives it a stunted flow if the guests don't really gel."
giantbomb,His voice just had that nervous crackle and it made me so scared lmfao
giantbomb,For real when Alex started talking I thought that was gonna be it
comics,I thought the second panel was going out not in
lfg,"Hi, I'm interested and own TTS! I mainly play on Roll20, but have used TTS before to play board/card games with friends. Is there a character sheet mechanic in the game or is it just used as a virtual space and to roll dice?

A little more about me:
I've played D&D for over a year, mostly DMing short-term campaigns online. I haven't played in a game that went past 5th level, and have been slowly getting into more published adventures. I haven't read HotDQ or the paired module, but I have read comments about it being railroady or cheesy, since it was somewhat outsourced and the first module for 5E. Have you run into issues there?"
giantbomb,#Verified
giantbomb,I'm honestly not with them on the S2 theme. I totally get that feeling after such a banger of the first season and have felt the same for other anime but pretty much all the MHA OPs have been fantastic.
giantbomb,YESSSSS WOOO
giantbomb,Tbf Martin talked about his From collab prior to the leak but yes knowing the name/logo was a bit of a bummer
giantbomb,They’re writers!!
MMA,"It was hilarious when Dana was just yelling, ""Do you know what they know? WHAT I TELL THEM"", as Brett sits there silently nodding."
giantbomb,This game looks dope. Reminds me so much of [EDGE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38740/EDGE/) which I highly recommend if anyone wants a cheaper alternative. 90% off this week coincidentally!
giantbomb,"Why do they quick look these games if it just devolves into griping about how it's a half decent game with no real features? Also, the bowser moment was pretty huge so just dropping it casually is kind of dickish"
giantbomb,Have him say “Metal Gear is about politics!”
dndnext,Watching more shows like Dimension 20 has taught me the value of a limited series. Having a specific goal with characters all somewhat tied to accomplishing that task within a set number of sessions can be super satisfying.
giantbomb,"I initially thought his stance was that Death Stranding wasn't political, which I mean whatever the game isn't even out yet. But to say the entirety of the Metal Gear Series is anti-nuclear but NOT political is mindboggling. 

The segment didn't benefit from anyone defining what ""politics"" meant in the larger context of consuming media and it was more of just ribbing on Dan, but at the same time, if he was really such a Kojima stan surely he would have read or seen Kojima interviews talking about MGS at some point, right?"
giantbomb,"The cutscenes are clickable so you shouldn't have to sit and wait through the animations if you want to get back into it. It also depends on how much experience you have with FPS games because it can get pretty fast-paced and you don't have health or ammo to spare.

It's hard to recommend any advice because it sounds like you aren't really enjoying the overall experience. I guess the best piece of advice at this stage of the game is to play it slow until you figure out where you want to go. The map pauses the game completely so you can always open it up to see what rooms are important or to map out a basic circuit. You can also just leave a level if things are too bad, which may be recommended if you have some good perks or a lot of ammo stashed."
