Games,"The purpose of rule 1 is to differentiate us from r/gaming. It's to prevent twitch streams and memes from being posted here. Or clips like ""FUNNY FORTNITE MONTAGE CHICKEN DINNER"". Our purpose is news, not funny video clips."
PS5,"Come on, people. This sub is meant for celebrating the launch of a new console.

Quit being dicks!"
PS5,"Reminder that doxxing, threatening to dox, and threatening violence will result in a ban."
Games,"Banjo-Tooie is one of my all time favourite games. I would have been 13ish when the game came out and I had really loved the first one so I was super hyped for it. My favourite world was Witchy World, it was a ton of fun, the mini games were great. I didn't find the worlds too difficult to explore but there were definitely some challenging jiggies. I've played it a few times since it came out on Xbox 360, and the on Xbox One on Rare Replay. The graphics are still pretty good considering the game's age. It definitely still holds up for me, I would absolutely play it again right now."
PS5,"Don't worry everyone, the scalpers get banned"

PS5,"If you want fewer shit posts, don't make shit posts, make good posts."
PS5,"If you do, modmail it to us!"
PS5,"Things will go back to normal, image posting won't be on forever, but we're just letting people have fun over the weekend and during launch. Averaging one new post every 30 seconds, it's very difficult to keep up with. But do report posts that should be taken down."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
CasualConversation,Hey OP please report comments like this so we can ban the transphobes!
PS5,Be nice.
PS5,Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
Games,"It's really fun! Definitely better with friends, not as much solo. But if you have at least one other person to play with it's totally worth it."

CasualConversation,"> I’ll add, when buying pregnancy tests I have had cashiers comment “hope it’s positive” on more than one occasion.

Oh noooooo! I used to work at a drug store and one of my coworkers said to a woman who was buying a pregnancy test ""Oh! What are you hoping for??"" and the woman looked real angry and replied ""No."" I was absolutely mortified. It's not cool to comment on what people are buying! Mind your own damn business."

**This submission makes it hard to encourage conversation.**  

[Be sure your thread opens up conversation & maintains a positive atmosphere that encourages users and yourself to participate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/wiki/encourage)

Here are some tips to help create a well rounded post

- Provide context in the submission text that directly relates to the title. Please no nonsensical ramblings.
- Open up conversation for users to comment - it helps to ask leading questions.
- A post can be as mundane or extravagant as you like but it must have enough substance to spark ongoing conversation.

If you'd like to edit your post with the above tips, please message the mods letting us know you did, so we can help you get it approved.

How does Just Cause 4 perform on PS4? I have tried many times to play it on Xbox but the performance is horrible, if I am even able to load into the game at all."
Games,"Have you played the other Kingdom Hearts games? The story is much more enjoyable when you know what's going on. I just spent 3 months playing every KH game for the first time and had an absolute blast. You should definitely play the other games, and don't skip Birth By Sleep either. Don't spoil the worlds for yourself either! It's fun to be surprised by where you're going next."

- Provide context in the submission text that directly relates to the title. Please no nonsensical ramblings.
- Open up conversation for users to comment - it helps to ask leading questions.
- A post can be as mundane or extravagant as you like but it must have enough substance to spark ongoing conversation.

If you'd like to edit your post with the above tips, please message the mods letting us know you did, so we can help you get it approved.
