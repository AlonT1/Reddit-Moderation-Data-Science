GhostRecon,"I was a big fan of Wildlands, despite its mediocre reviews. My pal and I, both working adults with busy lives, ended up playing the game for nearly a year, a few nights a week, even as ""better"" games came and went. There was something about its relaxed co-op experience that was punctuated with just enough action and variety to keep us engaged - allowing us to talk about more important life things over chat, while still enjoying a fun and sometimes challenging game.

I didn't exactly expect glowing reviews for Breakpoint, and most have been pretty brutal. Hasn't deterred me from pre-ordering the game, which arrives today (can't wait). I was, however, waiting for a review that I think captures my enthusiasm for the game, which I tried in the open beta and enjoyed immensely.

For me, this Vice review (of all places) captured my excitement, and so I wanted to share with the community.

If there's one thing I've learned in my 2 decades+ as a gamer, it's that there are games for different people. I don't want to suggest that the reviews aren't fair, and most times I actually agree with game reviewers - though not always. Sometimes a game gets great reviews, and I can't get into it due to the circumstances of my life. Bloodborne is an example. Fabulous game. Can't play it. I'm a busy guy with a career and a family, and just can't invest what it takes to play the game.

Other times, as with Breakpoint, I suspect that reviewers are looking for something completely different. They're trying to unearth the next big innovation in AAA budget games. I am fully onboard with that, and look forward to tentpole releases like The Last of Us 2 or Death Stranding.

But they don't understand that the little things that make Breakpoint dull to them makes the game great for me. Yes, it's another open world shooter - but it's built with co-op in mind. Yes, it borrows from Division - but it puts it in a truly open world with vehicles, helicopters, and tactical shooting. Yes, it doesn't have a great plot - but I don't want to be distracted by a plot when my main goal is to hang out with a friend in a videogame.

I also need a game I can play on my own time, when my friend and I are both online, and we just want something to hop into that's not too competitive, not too stressful, not too demanding - while still having great gameplay with great moments. Wildlands was that game for a year, and I hope (suspect) Breakpoint will keep us occupied for the year to come."

PS4,"I understand peoples' skepticism, but many game studios (and businesses in general) diversify their business models between games specifically to capture all monetization opportunities. I would be shocked if Rockstar was not aware that a large portion of their playerbase has no interest in microtransactions or online play, and would be much more willing to spend on single-player expansions. RDR and GTA are 2 very different franchises, with GTA being much better suited to microtransactions due to its over-the-top style. RDR is a slower and more atmospheric game, pulling in a more mature audience, and would make natural sense for singleplayer DLC. 

If I was a betting man, I'd bet that we'll see singleplayer content for RDR2."
Filmmakers,"To be honest, there's not a great central place to find unknown composers. I've tried searching places like Soundcloud and Bandcamp to minimal success. I have reached out to composers I heard on stock music sites like Audio Network and Musicbed, and had some success that way. I also listen to a lot of eclectic playlists on Spotify and have reached out to lesser known artists that I liked, but only once has that been fruitful. I'll also make sure that any artist has samples of composition work online somewhere before I reach out to them, as I consider composing to be a unique animal and not all musicians make great composers. 

My favorite way, however, is to just reach out directly to composers who I've heard in other works. Mostly that means I've heard them in films or documentaries, but recently I have started to hire composers for indie games as I've found them to be much more approachable, unique, and (frankly) affordable - largely because a lot of them produce their music digitally, so it's less expensive than composers used to working with live bands and orchestras. My favorite original score I've produced came from an indie game composer who is pretty unknown, though he did do some commercial work previously."
Filmmakers,"This is a great comment. I run a documentary film studio at a tech company and I’d also add that I not only want composers to be able to create for different moods, but I also look for composers that have a unique sound. There’s endless oceans of generic royalty free music to license, lots of which sounds identical. When I hire a composer for an original score it’s because they have a sound I can’t find on a music licensing site - or can’t find enough of to fill a film. Think of the unique sounds of some recent big hit composers like Micah Levi, Nicholas Britell, Anna Meredith and Dan Romer. Very distinct styles which ups their value tremendously. Find your voice and all that."
Games,"I find it really frustrating when people dismiss an incredibly complex problem with a reductionist ""Simple! \[Insert opinionated solution here\]."" 

Nothing about this conversation is simple. It deals with unimaginably complex challenges that companies from every industry are grappling with - such as dramatically changing consumer behaviors, a marketplace that moves exponentially faster than it did even a decade ago, and the difficulty of innovating gargantuan corporate behemoths to move in new and untested directions. 

This has nothing to do with open worlds. Open worlds are just a cosmetic manifestation of the challenge as game companies try to move away from ""boxed goods"" models that software companies in the 90s and 00s used, and instead move towards platform-like gaming experiences that are updated using continuous delivery methods that have become commonplace in virtually all modern tech companies (e.g. Facebook, Salesforce, Netflix, etc). 

Open worlds make that easier, since they can be continuously expanded on for relatively low cost. But ""open worlds"" are just a cosmetic manifestation of the underlying challenges. The big motivation driving development direction of some of these games is the desire to create games that can serve as enduring platforms that can be continuously expanded upon and monetized for relatively low cost, much like Fortnite, Rainbow Six: Siege, GTA: V, or Fifa. 

Open worlds are just a symptom of this trend. "

And for those that are curious, I use Fidelio X2s (with Vmoda Boom Mic) and an Astro Mixamp as my gaming headset with the PS4. I've tried dozens of setups and headphones, and this is by far the best I've hit on. Can't recommend the X2s enough. "

PSVR,"That's the thing about official announcements. There's never an official announcement, until there is.

I mean–look at [the logo for this fake VR-like headset](https://cdn.uploadvr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/No-Mans-Sky-Hints-2.jpg) on their marketing page. It practically spells ""VR.""

Games,"Yes! Rayman Legends is by far our favorite kids' game on PS4. Good call. Both Knack and Rayman Legends have that great mechanic where one player can die, and then rejoin a few seconds later. I think that's really the key to making these games playable with young kids. "
Games,"As a dad of a 5 year old, Knack was a godsend and made me wonder why there aren't more games like it. It's simple enough for him to get the basic mechanics, and I can play it by his side for the tougher puzzles. 

It's not a great game by any means, and I probably never would have played it if I didn't have a kid. But it is definitely a ton of fun with a little one, and fills a niche for kid-friendly couch co-op games that we need more of. There are tons of movies that are ""fun for the whole family"" but shockingly few games that meet this criteria.

Hugely recommended for parents. "
Games,"Gotcha. Finding reviews to trust is a tough one. While I don't think reviewers are in the pockets of game publishers, I've been too burned by games I didn't like but which got great reviews–likely because of some confirmation bias/herd mentality (e.g. I'm not a fan of Horizon, Dishonored, and Dragon Age:Inquisition). 

I don't know how to help you with this one, sorry. That said I wouldn't judge this game based on some social media marketing likely done by an underpaid intern.  "
Games,"Technical issues aside, if you didn't like the first you likely won't like this. Regarding your other point–the antagonists in this game aren't just labeled Nazis. They're literally Nazis. ""Actual Nazis"" in your words. Which is why I'm confused what you mean by a video review with a ""fair and balanced"" take? 

Do you not trust the normal stable of video game review sites like IGN, Destructoid, RPS, Polygon, Gamespot? Or are you looking for a game reviewer that specifically addresses the POV of Nazis? 

Legitimately curious what you mean. "
Games,"Agreed 1000%. DOOM is a great example of how good writing can elevate a game to new heights. DOOM would have been ""fun"" without its writing, but combined it makes it truly great. I don't think it would have been as successful as it was had DOOM had poor writing. 

Same thing goes for games like Portal. Great puzzle game even without its writing. But with the writing, it became something of a cult phenomenon. Can you even imagine Portal without Glados? I'm not sure I would have played to the end, let alone been so excited for a sequel.  "
Games,"While the protagonists (the rebels) are complex and flawed, I can confirm that there are no moral equivalences in this game. The Nazi villains are the face of extreme evil, and I found myself invested in the protagonists with surprising intensity. That said, there is surprising and welcome nuance with one Nazi character in particular–but I won't spoil it for you because it's awesome."
Games,"This is something I've struggled with too. As embarrassing as it is to admit, Ghost Recond Wildlands is one of the games I've had the most fun with in the past year–despite its horrendous writing–simply because sometimes I want a fun co-op game to play with friends. 

That said, I *do* think that good writing is a quality every game should strive towards. The definition of ""good writing"" may vary depending on the game and what they're trying to achieve, and some games may highlight their writing more than others in the same way that some movies do, but it should be a goal. As fun as Wildlands is, it may have been something great if the characters weren't shouting ""Shitballs"" every ten seconds. I have at least two friends who were so turned off by the terrible dialogue and lackluster plot that they traded it in the same week. 

But more to the point–I want to believe that it's in the interest of game publishers to invest in writing. Look at the TV Golden Age we're living through. TV was stagnating for a long time until a series of shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Louie, and others came along and showed that there's tremendous appetite for quality writing. I think resonant stories with compelling characters is a universal characteristic of quality entertainment regardless of the medium, and games should be no exception. "
Games,"I was referring to The Dark Knight Returns, the Frank Miller graphic novel. "
Games,"I played the first one which had similarly stellar writing. Together with the early reviews, it was clear this one continued in the same vein. "
Games,"I'm gonna assume you don't actually believe I'm related to Bethesda (I'm not), and the gist of your post is asking ""Why did you write this?"" We spend a lot of time on r/games talking about what games are doing wrong. My opinion is that if we want the games industry to change, we should also promote examples of games that get stuff right. 

I think W2:TNC gets a lot right, and represents a rare breed of game (AAA single-player story-driven game with real characters) that should be supported by others who value these things. If we can slam games with scummy practices, why can't we support games that do something right?"
truegaming,"Great point. I've always felt that Nintendo and Blizzard are two rare examples of companies that are radically customer-focused, and it's evident by how loyal their fans have been over the span of decades. "
truegaming,A game selling well now is not an indicator of future success. Nokia owned the cellphone market until iPhone and Android launched. PUBG's success should be seen as a warning shot by all major publishers that they misunderstood the market and need to correct for that. Companies can only make so many mistakes before they start to feel the consequences to their bottom line. 
truegaming,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. Much appreciated. I don't have too much time to get granular on my response, but I would just say that this line from the definition is the one that I think most qualified PUBG as a disruptor: 

>When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’ offerings in volume, disruption has occurred.

PUBG is a new game by a previously unknown studio, and it has already achieved mainstream adoption on a scale that many AAA games only dream of. All while only being on PC. In early access. 

I rarely speak to game companies in the course of my work, but if I did I would caution AAA publishers that this is a warning shot across the bow. Games are not immune to large scale disruption, and PUBG is evidence of that. "
truegaming,"Disruption is often good for the industry as a whole, just not the individual incumbents that lose market share. Uber disrupted taxi companies, but actually grew the market for taxi riders. 

The games ""industry"" could very well be fine, and even healthier, after a disruption. But the major publishers could lose out if new entrants continuously manage to capture their audience. PUBG may not pose an existential threat to major studios now. But what if it launched across consoles and sold 30 million more copies? How would that affect the COD or Assassins Creed player base? What if there were another dozen PUBG-size surprises that launched to similar success? What effect would this have on major franchises? 

My question was less about whether games will survive as a medium – I have no doubt they will grow beyond our wildest expectations. My question was more around whether the big publishers who dominate now will be the ones to shepherd games into their future, or whether there will be a changing of the guard due to disruptive new entrants (think of what Pixar did for family movies, or what Adult Swim did for TV). "
truegaming,"VR would be considered a ""disruptor"" in this context since they are a new entrant to the games industry. However, as much as I believe in VR (I own a PSVR), it is still too early to call VR a disruptor since it has not yet achieved mainstream adoption. 

For example, PSVR just sold over 10 million VR-compatible games since launch. PUBG alone sold over 10 million copies in half the amount of time, while still in early access. This is a serious indicator of disruptive potential."
truegaming,"I edited the OP to include this definition of disruption as coined by the author Clayton M Christensen. After reading the following definition, would you still argue that PUBG is not a disruptor? 

> “Disruption” describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses. Specifically, as incumbents focus on improving their products and services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin by successfully targeting those overlooked segments, gaining a foothold by delivering more-suitable functionality—frequently at a lower price. Incumbents, chasing higher profitability in more-demanding segments, tend not to respond vigorously. Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the performance that incumbents’ mainstream customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’ offerings in volume, disruption has occurred.

"
truegaming,"No worries. In the world of business, disruption has a much broader and more wide-reaching definition.

This [article](https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation) has my absolute favorite definition of disruption. It's by Clayton M Christensen who wrote the classic ""Innovator's Dilemma"" book. 

>  “Disruption” describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses.

truegaming,"It's honestly a little shocking to see somebody deny that Minecraft was a disruptive game. It spawned an entire genre and art-style of open world voxel games, became the face of gaming for an entire generation, and eventually sold to Microsoft for $2.5 billion dollars. 

For context, Star Wars – one of the oldest and most beloved franchises in entertainment history – sold to Disney for $4 bln dollars. That means that an indie game came out of nowhere and within the span of a few years became about half as valuable as the entire Star Wars franchise. 

How is that not a textbook case of disruption?"
truegaming,"> I don't think this is an either/or kind of thing. It can both be the case that there are markets that aren't fully being represented and sold to, and that large developers are tone deaf and open themselves up to missing out on significant streams of revenue because they only iterate instead of innovate.

I love the way you phrased this - too many game publishers iterate instead of innovate. 

Many companies iterate in the wrong direction or in a short-sighted way, not realizing they're iterating towards margins that are changing in the wider market. For instance, would Blockbuster have made more money by renting music too? Maybe. But it wouldn't have saved them from a market that was rapidly evolving as consumer behaviors changed.  

Activision may be iterating CoD to capture more money in the short-term through micro-transactions, loot boxes, or whatever, but missing the fact that the market conditions are shifting dramatically as consumers become fatigued with existing offerings. That lack of foresight might mean that they missed an opportunity to innovate their product line to launch another billion-dollar franchise like PUBG. And in the world of business a missed opportunity can be just as fatal as a total failure."
truegaming,"Blizzard I would say is one of the few game publishers that is radically customer-centric. They have an incredible pulse on the games industry and the gaming audience in general and are experts at delivering what customers want. Overwatch is a prime example of a remarkable product-market fit. 

I don't have experience with Tribes, but Lawbreakers seems to be a disastrous miscalculation of the market and a prime example of what's at stake for publishers who aren't paying attention to what gamers want. Did gamers really want another round-based competitive and generic-looking FPS? The product was fine, it plays well, but it failed because of a grossly incompetent miscalculation of the market. "
truegaming,"This is correct. Companies often appear monolithic and can even be hugely profitable before disruption hits. Nokia was absolutely massive before the iPhone hit. It was the #1 cellphone manufacturer in the world. Just look at the [cover of Forbes magazine](https://imgur.com/SBUxcyj) right before the iPhone hit. 

What's important in forecasting disruption are trends. Are massive AAA games consistently underperforming? While certainly not all are, many of the biggest [AAA games are not performing as well as expected.](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-25-weak-aaa-launches-are-a-precursor-to-industry-transition) How has customer loyalty to, and satisfaction with, game publishers changed in recent years? Some companies like Blizzard and Nintendo certainly continue to benefit from customer loyalty. But what about Ubisoft, or EA, or Activision? 

In general, when there is such a high level of consumer dissatisfaction, it's a big warning sign. And considering how much customers have turned against major publishers, I'd consider it a pretty scary alarm bell.

truegaming,"Thank you for such a great discussion point!

What I would counter is that disruption doesn't always come in the form of radical new innovations. More often innovation and disruption comes in the form of improved customer experiences. Amazon wasn't disruptive because it sold stuff online - that had been around forever. It was disruptive because it provided the absolute best customer experience for ordering stuff online. In fact, Amazon's official company vision statement is ""To be Earth's most customer-centric company.""

How this would apply to games is exactly in what you described – they took something others were doing poorly, or without the proper ambition, and elevated it by just creating something better. They executed on their MVP (minimum viable product) flawlessly - the game is buggy, unoptimized, imperfect, but it got the basic mechanics better than anyone else. 

This is true of most disruptive companies, whether it's Facebook, Whatsapp, Warby Parker, Slack or any other disruptive company. Rarely are disruptors doing something wholly new. More often than not, they're just doing something *better* than their competitors. And they do that by putting the customer experience first in a way that major game publishers don't seem to be doing.

truegaming,"I'm not even sure that there needs to be a major innovation in technology to disrupt the big game publishers. Even working within the confines of the existing gaming audience, there are only so many gamers and hours to go around. 

All it takes is a few more PUBG-like surprises to capture the attentions of the gaming community, and there won't be a big enough audience to support the massive budgets of existing AAA game franchises like CoD. I think this is especially true since gamers tend to now get ""hooked"" on single games, pour months or years into it, before moving on. If gamers aren't getting ""hooked"" on your franchise, you could be screwed for a long time. "
truegaming,"Well, of course I use shooters as the primary case study since shooters and action games [represent half of the games market.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189592/breakdown-of-us-video-game-sales-2009-by-genre/) There will always be innovative games, but when discussing the ""games industry"" it's not unfair to use shooters/action as the main point of discussion. "
truegaming,"I think the move towards more immersive, cinematic, and realistic depictions of war/combat was what made CoD and MW so groundbreaking. Which is why it begs the question why the trend didn't continue in this direction, but instead moved away from that immersion into more outlandish, fast-paced, arcadey gameplay. "
truegaming,"The Last of Us is a great example of a game that got us closer to what we see in movies - the movement was weighty, the action messy and chaotic, the pace often slow and deliberate and the atmosphere realistic. 

Another example is Rainbow Six: Siege.

Both of these games are huge successes, so I wonder why gamedevs don't invest more in the mechanics/immersion that made those games so remarkable. Instead, I see budgets funneled into larger and larger open worlds, faster gameplay, more over-the-top set pieces, and immersion-breaking ""game-ification."" 

I guess to me it seems so obvious that players want immersion, realism and grit that the only explanation I can understand is if these things were extra technically challenging. But maybe you're right, and gamedevs are skeptical that gamers want immersion."
Games,"Before anyone complains about the price-tag, it's important to understand a few things.

1) All operators can be unlocked without paying anything, it just requires a substantial amount of playtime. 

2) There are Siege players out there (including me) for whom the price is marginal. This game has given me and friends hundreds of hours of enjoyment and revived competitive FPS in my life. I would gladly pay twice the price just to ensure this game continues to grow and thrive. In my hyperbolic opinion, it is the most significant milestone in competitive tactical FPS since Counter-Strike. 

This is the first game in over a decade that has me coming back to it routinely almost a year after launch, so to see it getting support for a second year is a massive win in my gaming life. 

Take my money, and then some!

Games,"What about third-person games? I personally haven't tried VR in a real game yet, so I'm uninformed, but what would be the problem with controlling a character in 3rd-person and using VR simply to look in on the character as though looking into a 3D diorama? "
Games,"The reviews on Steam have been pretty encouraging, so I just picked it up. Will play after work and try to post my initial impressions. "
Games,"DMZ meets DayZ would be incredible, especially if they maintained the photojournalist aspect. Imagine trying to survive while also needing to take good photos of the conflict to sell to the media in order to gain money/reputation and buy new equipment, get to new areas, make alliances, etc. 

Brilliant. "
Games,Amnesia meets X-Files? 
Games,That is ridiculous and awesome and I would totally play the shit out of that. I imagine some dystopian (utopian?) world where everything is settled by soccer matches. Turf dispute between gangs? Play for it. Two political candidates running for mayor? Game on.
