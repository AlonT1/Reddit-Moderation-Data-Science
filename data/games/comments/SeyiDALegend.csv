assassinscreed,I stopped playing Valhalla because there were too many bugs on PS4 and it really isn't that interesting story-wise so I don't even think Valhalla is better than Odyssey at this point.
Games,"> trusted reviewers completely dodged how fucking broke then game is. 

This is why I love the Review Thread for each launch I can skim through and pick up on patterns. What stuck out for me was big names like Giant Bomb, Gamespot, PC Games dropping scathing summaries which set off alarm bells. Alongside the fact ACG hadn't dropped a review the biggest game of the year yet, why didn't he get a review code right? Then I saw SkillUp mention that console versions were not given out and footage limited to marketing material. 

All this together make very clear something was fundamentally wrong with the game."
Games,What console are you on? Isn't the issue the base consoles are in terrible shape?
Games,You think this will go down as the buggiest high profile release after AC: Unity? I don't think people will forget how bad the base console versions are considering how many pre-orders they sold even with the positive reviews...
Games,"Has anyone felt the writing throughout the trailers have been pretty bad? It feels almost too edgy with the excessive swearing, every NPC having a screw loose and complete lack of morals. I mean I get it, that's world we are in but it could do with a bit more sophisticated dialogue at certain points."
AskReddit,I thought the nose bleed thing only happened in anime
soccer,"> His injury has forced the team to take a more cautious approach

I think the team's response to the Aston Villa game is a bigger factor. Faced with Adrian having another tenure in goal and Gomez getting injured shortly afterwards, meant the super high line isn't sustainable without a CB with high recovery pace"
anime,With Zeke's power being so OP so why do they need the Founding Titan's power so bad?
soccer,"Okay hearing the way Pogba described it and this I think I had covid briefly because the same thing happened to me. I had no symptoms all year then at some point a few months back I couldn't jog more than 10 minutes. Bare in mind I was doing 25 minute 5k throughout lockdown. Then my pre season started and I was out of breath throughout games. This was extremely surprising for me because I am the midfielder who has the legs to run all day. So i thought maybe I had low iron levels but the supplements didn't help so I had blood tests and it came back normal. After a month I feel better now, I'm at the same stamina levels as before and to this day I haven't had any of the other covid symptoms."
Games,"> Even when I got around level 100, those orc berserkers scare me.

The moment you had more than 2 on you, it was curtains"
Games,Ahh I think back to the days of me and the homies from Sweden and North America running up on PK guilds in Carlin town exacting revenge for our fallen rookies only to get our asses handed to us by some lvl 200 sorcerer's with 5 backpacks of SD runes. Good times.
Games,"> It seems to be really popular, but only because of good will from the first installment.

I think good will is the wrong word to describe why people are still interested in this series even with it's decline. Dragon Age games scratch an itch - an fantasy RPG with a close knit of companions you bond with contained within a world built over multiple installments. People are now heavily invested in the world itself and the outcomes it can provide to characters within. This doesn't have to come from Bioware, nor is there any goodwill left to be coerce by. We just want that particular experience again and again."
hiphopheads,"Do you listen to the Daily Duppy's by any chance? They are like UK's freestyle section, a bit like Funk Flex sort of thing. I feel the production on Daily Duppys is a good introduction in the best of what the UK has to offer.

hiphopheads,"Dappy has been doing great features in the last year or so, I recommend you listen to anything he has done recently for sure. Hopefully we get an album from him in 2021"
Android,Every hip-hop playlist has the same 5 billboard charters liike seriously?

hiphopheads,90s babies hearing this beat getting crazy nostalgic vibes rn
soccer,Can't believe we started Mane today. Anyone who was paying attention saw he was a bit off against Leicester as well. He's clearly exhausted and we're playing him into the ground.
soccer,"He's 19 and having seen him play in other games, has bags of potential. When you're this young, you can afford to have stinkers every once in a while."
soccer,"You're definitely missing ""something"" if you couldn't see that Neco and Tsimika's performances were like night and day tonight. That was truly an horrendous performance from Williams BUT as you said he's not another generational talent like TAA so not too fussed but please don't pretend he wasn't one of the worst players tonight. It's disgenious and not necessary, the lad is young and will learn from this."
Games,"Firstly, the whole inflation argument is a scam but when everyone else is using it you can't expect the video games industry to be an exception.


Secondly, people are not ""going to lengths"" to defend corporations. It's just putting things into perspective. I see OP's point that considering how much we pay for other hobbies, gaming is a cheap hobby. I think it's naive to believe gaming companies should ignore other industries raising their prices to maintain the same price point for another decade."
Games,"We can moan all we want online but if they are able to make record sales whilst hiking the prices permanently then I don't blame them. They are a business first with shareholders to please. Every other industry increase their prices when they realise their customers are willing to spend more. It just sucks they are pretending as if they haven't already built a predatory business model to cover increasing development costs in the form of microtransactions.


What is important is that there continues to be physical versions of these games so we can combat price hikes with retail discounts months down the line. I don't mind waiting until a game drops to a affording price as I will only pay what I feel like paying for a game. But the day we go full digital and we're forced to purchase only through the Playstation store, we're in big trouble as the digital discounts are nowhere near as favourable as with physical units."
soccer,Damn you got him lol
soccer,Just respond to them directly instead of circlejerking prematurely
soccer,Can I just say the white/gold colour scheme was so sexy back then
soccer,Bobby is returning to form but I don't see how Bobby isn't droppable but you might be inferring that Mane and Salah are.
soccer,We have too much ball retention for commentors to be talk ONLY about our press and intensity. We're doing so many other things well particularly how drilled all our players are on a system level even with this many starters out injured. Our coaching team deserves so much praise man.
soccer,"I literally spat out my tea, this guy never misses ffs"
Games,"I was literally going to mention you as you tend to be one of the very few reviewers who talk about sound consistently compared to others. Nice to know you're aware of the issue, keep up the good work!"
Galaxy_S20,"Thank you for the write up! 

I really appreciate it, I just use my phone for scrolling Reddit threads, swiping the keyboard for texting and tapping between apps. So it's really the pinch to zoom and ghost touches that might ruin my day to day experience. Still my iPhone 7 still works fine so I will wait to see if this is a software or hardware issue."
Galaxy_S20,Thank you I'll be checking this thread
Galaxy_S20,When did you get your replacement?
assassinscreed,The bugs are pretty bad on PS4. The first boss fight died on his own failing to climb the wall randomly and my game crashed during my first assassination mission. It was at that point that I refuse to open the game again until there's a new patch. I've never felt seen so many bugs in the first 10 hours of a game
assassinscreed,Kotaku isn't the first to recommend turning down the assassin difficulty to at least default simply because AI recognise too quickly on maximum. I'm not sure about turning on instant assassination as you might miss out on some interesting mini boss fights.
assassinscreed,"What console are you on? My game (on PS4) crashed the other day, 10 hours in, I'll hate to find out it's corrupted also."
Galaxy_S20,If I message you in a few weeks asking whether the replacement went well don't be surprised I've been itching to upgrade from this iPhone 7 for some time lol
Galaxy_S20,"Are there any UK users who recently bought it, still having issues? I'm considering buying..."
AskReddit,Someone tell T.I. this immediately
Games,"This is a very good take on this. Someone with unpublished worked wouldn't normally get this opportunity but if she's spent over a decade analysing and reviewing game writing she will definitely have an eye for good game writing to some extent.

Using your connections and coming in just as a junior role is pretty standard in any industry. I understand the scepticism behind this but it isn't as shady as some are making it out to be."
hiphopheads,"> Future for their bars and lyrical content.

PS4,"I literally posted this the Assassin's Creed forum 5 minutes ago

 \---

This isn't the first time I've encountered bugs in a Ubisoft title but I've never encountered so many bugs and rough patches within the first 10 hours.

* The first boss fight ended with the boss dying from falling down twice
* I got stuck in the snow where my character spazzed out in Norway
* The audio has been cutting out in a lot of my conversations from the beginning
* The game just crashed on me during my first assassination attempt in England.
* The parkour is too clunky to be by design

I've been playing on base PS4 and I have seen a lot of mentions around forums around the bugginess of the game and ignored them because bugs always get mentioned in every game release but I've never had a game breaking one since Fallout New Vegas nor have encountered them in such volume so early on. I don't think I can't return until some of this is patched in."

Games,What do you think of the combat so far? I personally prefer Odyssey's weighty combat to this so far....
Games,"People say Ubisoft games lack in immersion, polish, writing, visuals and quest design but they do understand fun better than people give them credit for. When it comes to the actual gameplay loop and Quality of Life of the game experience, Ubisoft are not appreciated enough sometimes. Maybe their games never light up the world but they scratch an itch that's accessible from a gameplay perspective for the masses and deliver a suitable standard of fun consistently."
Games,Yeah. I was planning on getting Cyberpunk 2077 then it got delayed and I have a lot of company holiday to use so I just went for Valhalla instead. People say fans would have bought AC regardless but I feel casual gamers only have time to play one game at a time so it is a matter of choosing between what you have time to play at the present moment.
assassinscreed,"Okay cool, I guess I was hoping the combat would be similar enough for me to just get the hang it straight away. I'll keep playing, unlock more skills and abilities and hopefully encounter more intelligent enemies."
assassinscreed,I was thinking maybe it's because I was on Pathfinder mode but the Raven doesn't mark enemies and controlling it feels very stiff on PS4.
assassinscreed,I personally like the combat in Odyssey and Valhalla's is worst so far.
assassinscreed,"I'm 2 hours in and I prefer the combat in Odyssey. The timing is too instant, there's no weight to the attacks and the AI are dumber than usual even by Ubisoft standards. Since it's quite a big part of the playing experience I'm not sure how by the end of it I can put this game over Odyssey."
assassinscreed,"I'm 2 hours in and the audio sync is super off on base PS4, it clips out randomly in conversations I don't see how they are going patch something so sporadic and widespread anytime soon."
Games,"> I want to know what people didn't like, and decide for myself if that's a deal-breaker or not

This is how I always view game reviews combined with a few gameplay/story videos to get a feel for the game."
hiphopheads,Maybe the No Nut November is getting to me but the headline had me saying pause!
Games,"Between Uncharted Collection and Demon Souls Remake where do you think this sits? I'm reading the ""Updating the textures, shaders, models, effects and technical features"" part and I'm wondering if that's enough or if there's anything that would clearly feel dated in 2021."
Android,There's touch screen issues? I'll have to keep an eye out for this. Thank you for the heads up!
Android,"Yeah I know there are other factors outside the SD chip for example it's only 6 GB RAM but apparently this one in particular performs better than the plus and ultra (not the note). I've seen comparisons for OnePlus and Pixel so far which are the others I considered and it seemed to do well.


And yes, if the S21 drops in January then I might wait. Thank you for the heads up."
Games,"I've always seen battle passes become more and more unattainable as the seasons go by. 

They seem modelled to test the limits of the most committed players rather than tailored to the ""average"" player experience. Particularly if they are not ""whales"" i.e. high spenders. 

They will never say this directly but these battle passes are not meant to be attained through gameplay but rather to be paid for. 

Personally I just ignore the season/battle pass systems and focus on playing the game rather looking cool playing the game (skins). I know that's harder for some but these microtransactions have been a fool's errand from the get-go."
soccer,Those who believe most footballers are on PEDs explain how WADA can spot Sakho on diet pills but not everything else that's apparently swept under the rug?
soccer,Either Atalanta defenders are slower than defenders we regularly face or they are set up wrong. It's been a long time since I've seen our forwards having so much space to run into. It's worked wonders tonight!

soccer,"Coach Messi: ""Listen, dribble past those 3 defenders then top corner""

LiverpoolFC,I think his source got pissed at him so he's trying to backtrack. A bit late mate.
hiphopheads,His other albums mid and his features are fantastic. You get the meme and refusing to acknowledge it. Let's be honest lol
soccer,Weirdly enough I would like some insight into Liverpool's dressing room at half time and see how it compares.
hiphopheads,"Stormzy is one of the best but Chip is on another level, this beef gonna be crazy."
LiverpoolFC,"We played so bad that Wijnaldum registered multiple penetrative passes, one which helped set up one of the goals. Overall he had a good away game.

Salah had one of his most clinical games whereas Firmino couldn't control a TV with remote in hand.

Jota looks the real deal and needs to be less timid when he enters the final 3rd. If the pass isn't on, out your feet and shoot! You might get a deflection (or 3).

Robertson should've be lumped with the disgraceful display of the right side of the defence and the overall inability to manage high defensive line.

Then there midfielders are a mixed bag. Keita getting subbed made sense, we needed more intensity and he wasn't going to give it."
LiverpoolFC,That defensive line giving me nightmares tonight
soccer,"> our next game is against the league leaders

Referring to Everton as league leaders is very on-brand for 2020 tbh"
soccer,Kelleher....is he ready?
soccer,"We forced our own mistakes by continuing to play a high line after shipping 4 goals in 45 minutes. Just look at the last 2 goals. It's disgraceful in-game management. We really needed leadership in that second half to get a hold of the game but whether it was arrogance or intentional in order to get back into the game, we decided to continue head first into the storm that was already battering us at all costs.

Edit: grammar"
soccer,"No one talking about the 2-3 chances we had after we conceded that we didn't take which would have stop Villa's momentum. Firmino miscontrolled the ball in dangerous areas multiple times and even Jota lacked intent on two occasions in the first half (but he's new so understandable). If we're clinical, it sets the rest of the team at ease but we kept missing or trying to pass the ball into the net when we needed to be more courageous to get back into the game. We lacked intensity."
soccer,"This has been the excuse since the Watford game and we've been leaking goals ever since. At some point you have to look to other factors. It's unacceptable for a defence to need 8 months to find consistency, because that's where the alarm bells have been ringing really. I understand if we don't have the bite to score goals but why are we playing a high risk strategy with complacency? We were 6-2 down and the defensive line was on the half way line. Like really?"
soccer,"You know I think it's the presence of certain players that keep us at a high level. When you see Henderson and Mane winning their individual battles, you are spurred to win yours. When you have a calm collected Allison marshalling the box you can focus on your job. Everything went wrong in this game but Klopp is right in eluding to our mentality today. It was non-existent."
soccer,That defensive live is going to give me nightmares
soccer,"Given how we're about to hit the second wave, this season could get very chaotic if more players test positive and are forced to miss games/train away from their teammates."
LiverpoolFC,"Starboy Jones really going to light up the league this season!
Huh? Why y'all laughing? Seriously?
Look I'm talking facts here. I don't do ifs, buts and maybes. I do absolutes.
Look if you're aunt had balls, she'll be your uncle but she doesn't. You know what I mean?
Look. I'm just saying Curtis Jones is a serious prospect and you'll see for yourselves this season."
PS4,"No guns, just fists throwing wayward hooks in a game of battle royle."
PS4,I have this feeling we will be seeing Naughty Dog's multiplayer based on TLOU2 they've been working on
hiphopheads,"Big Sean fans, talk to me. Do you honestly think this is his best work? Better than Detroit 1 and Dark Sky Paradise?"
Games,Well I (kinda) defended Shadow of War too. For me microtransactions  existence isn't the worst thing ever. It's the execution. You won't find me slandering other companies for simply having microtransactions. I try to stay consistent on my personal stance. The same probably can't be said about other people.
Games,"I know we should be sceptical about this statement but at least it's not part of the single player campaign. I imagine it's it's very difficult to justify to shareholders omitting microtransactions from any multiplayer game given the amount of money Rockstar and EA make from them.


Also I'm thinking back to Shadow of War microtransactions controversy only to play it for myself within a week of release and it not really impacting my experience at all.

But still some scepticism is always healthy but it's better we wait to see it for ourselves.

Edit: Grammar"
soccer,Is there an article I can read more into this? This sounds wild but mad entertaining
hiphopheads,"I've been a Big Sean fan from day and I'll say this is one of my least favourites. His beat selection has always been top notch but these new flows he's trying to include into his verses don't do it for me. Squeezing extra syllables into punchlines, triplet flows mid-verse and varying the pace throughout songs seem too off-beat. 

Harder Than My Demons, Full Circle, Guard Your Heart are the only ones I care about and these Jhene Aiko collabs are really not that great.  

It's a shame because I've been enjoying his features this year but there's no way this is better than his previous work. I want more tracks like Single Again and No More Interviews.

But I'm a big fan so lemme listen again one more time, on my way to my football match then I'll make my final verdict. I could be wrong....."
science,So I'm about to get a steriod injection next week for a rotator cuff injury and I wanted to confirm I'm okay with the risk of catching covid from my immune system being suppressed temporarily so this makes sense.
PS4,"Wait, you can download it withour pre-ordering?"
hiphopheads,For all we know it could've been just punchline to rhyme with so I'm just gonna enjoy the song because there's way too much problematic subject matter in hip hop for me to care about this line in particular as if people are taking Big Sean's lyrics for scientific evidence to make serious health decisions on.

Android,"Why is regular OS updates such a big deal that someone would switch to iOS? Functionally what does not having the latest Android update do to your day-to-day experience?

Games,They anticipated people in your scenario not enjoying the game because you didn't die enough. See 20:40 mark in the video.
soccer,"Coutinho isn't just any Bayern players. He's on loan, he grew up wanting to play for Barcelona, I'm just thought he'll feel something for them......"
soccer,You know what I mean.... He's on loan so his contract is still Barcelona or just a loan eradicate all sentiment towards the clun you'll be going back to next season....
soccer,Well yes but firstly he's on loan and Barcelona was meant to be his childhood dream club so forgive me for thinking that a player on loan wouldn't want to celebrate against his main club....Particularly if he's going back.
soccer,Is it me or did I see Coutinho celebrating Bayern's goal?
Games,"I've mainly watched the movies and for me it's the ""grunts"" in between the big fights. Watching Superman 3-punch combo common humans on planet earth doesn't make much sense to me. I remember watching the Avengers gameplay video and thinking how silly it was seeing Thor swing his hammer at  everyday criminals. It works in Spider-Man and Batman games so I always wondered how it'll work in a Superman game. Would it just be a series of boss fights? Will the gameplay prominently be preventing casualties? How does Superman earn power ups in an open world? I admit I don't follow the comics so I'm going based on the limited movies and games I've seen."
Games,"All this time I have been saying a Superman game would suck because he'll either be too powerful from a gameplay perspective or too weak in game to reflect his abilities shown in the movies/comics.

But a game where he's the big boss fight (it seems) or the endgame to some extent makes a whole lot of sense."
hiphopheads,"Did you miss the ""fake"" part in my comment?

Focus on your comprehension instead of my IQ."
hiphopheads,All the fake gang members look understandably half-hearted about being involved in this music video lol
soccer,A truly top-tier manager holds on to a 15 point lead in most circumstances in my humble opinion.

See the way I did it was focus on Companion quests and do the bare minimum of the quests on the war table to get points. Everything else is irrelevant."
soccer,"You'll get downvoted but it's true he cannot hit a shot cleanly most of the time. He's more of a poacher that can do everything else better than 99% of players in his position. Hopefully next season he can find his end product again.

soccer,Robertson heard y'all talking shit :)
soccer,"Find me that redditor that said Tierney is better than Robertson, I just want to talk."
soccer,Robertson heard Redditors talking shit on his name after the Man City game and has been on fire since.
hiphopheads,What I find commendable is that she hasn't said one bad thing about Kanye throughout all this. That's true love and compassion.
hiphopheads,"Guys please, rapping ""off-beat"" isn't grime. Drake rapping off beat was either intentional Blueface style or UK Skippity flows (I forgot the actually term) where the MC hops in and out of pockets requires skill with using short, snappy syllables to ride the beat, [Ghetts old style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c88ShF5zg6c) is an example of this or [Skepta using it intermittently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxPF9Vl3zwM) in his freestyles but doesn't really work with Drake's cadence."

hiphopheads,"I get why you're doing this but at this point, if your fav. rapper and everyone else in the industry continues to do music with CB it's pointless to be bothering other fans for listening to their fav. artist featuring CB."
soccer,We honestly looked more like a historic side last season but that wasn't enough against Man City.
Games,"What customisation options did you enjoy utilising in the game?

Would you recommend Japanese or English Dubbed? I'm comfortable with subtitles personally.

How good are the side quests?"
soccer,Lmao the way you lads downvoted this guy into oblivion over grammar has been in stitches
soccer,"Do we want to discuss how our front 3 are consistent in everything but finishing this season or shall we tip toe around the issue by blaming VAR and the ref? 


We really need a back-up forward for games like this. Firmino actually had one of his better games but he really needs to be putting these chances away. Salah has never been too good at hitting shots cleanly, he's more of a poacher which isn't that effective when Burnley pack out the box. We need created enough chances today but we need to be braver on the edge of the area when the opposition are tightly guarding it.


I don't know what it is this season but the rest of the team perfectly timed helping out on the scoresheet whilst our front 3 have regressed in converting chances. Maybe it's fatigue and Salah goes back to his season 1 version of himself next season."
Games,"> Odyssey is a straight-up masterpiece

Kudos for being brave enough to say this because I actually agree. I really loved the game but every time it's being discussed, I see the same rehashed criticisms that I see with every Ubisoft release.

I don't mind people pointing out flaws but most of the time, it doesn't seem nuanced just regurgitated and outdated."
Games,"All I see Assassin Creed Odyssey in a different setting and I'm fine with that. If you gave me Witcher 3 in a different setting, I would be fine with that too. The way some people are responding to this, you'll think they were expecting to be impressed by the combat (which was never Ubisoft's specialist) or that it would Assassin focused (hasn't been that way since Unity). 

The RPG elements are what I'm more interested in than the play by play combat tbh."
Games,No one buys a game purely off how aligned the game title is to the gameplay so does it still matter at this point? How many years has it been since Ubisoft released an Assassin based Creed game? We all know it is purely a business decision to keep the name of the series the same so next thing to do is judge whether it's a good game in its self. To me it's such a minor inconvenience considering how deep into the series we are at this point.
hiphopheads,Drake has blood on his hands if he really stopped Maybach 6 verse being released. That shit was hard as fuck.
hiphopheads,Thug isn't above Drake lol
soccer,Shouting at each other is fair game but getting physical is a bit far. I've played in different Sunday league teams and the scrapping is left for the opposition not your teammates lol
soccer,Mane's outburst over Salah's selfishness that one time is an example of that. And you can hear Van Dijk shouting at Trent all the time so you can see it here and there at times. But it rarely spills onto the pitch like the incident last night...
soccer,If Lloris was the opposition everyone would be brawling/throwing hands so yeah it's man-handling.
soccer,Where the anti-bodies at?
soccer,"A captain getting pushing his teammate about in front of others is bad leadership. I don't care if you're wearing the armband, shout at me if I make a mistake but don't lay hands as if we're going to have it out. Not cool at all man."

soccer,Okay can someone explain what's going on?
Games,"> ""everyone I cared for either left me or died. everyone except f*cking you!

That scene gets me every time.

But the rest of what you said would work but Abby would also be 30 years older. By that point the character potential is gone but maybe Abby's sidekick could carry on the story?

Anyways I don't see Naughty Dog touching this IP for another 5 years at least. The dust needs to settle and they got a Factions multiplayer to work on."
Games,"Abby is having a fresh start away from everything in her past, the fireflies, her family ties, her friends, WLF. She can choose to keep searching for fireflies or she can encounter unfinished from her WLF days. Think about her last interaction with WLF - imagine someone survived..... Plus her new companion is still discovering themselves after also severing all their ties of their previous life.

Ellie on the otherhand comes across as spent. She ruined all her previous relationships. She's broken and quite an irredeemable character in my eyes. All she has is her immunity which could everything on a world building level but little in the context of forming intimate relationships and that's what ND games are all about. I have no appetite to see Ellie form new bonds in her current state."
Games,A 3rd game should (in my own opinion) be based on Abby but the public perception of her may be too negative to sanction her own game.
Games,"> I'm more curious as to what their next move is.

LiverpoolFC,We were worse against Watford tbh. We've just been very unproductive with our chances in the first half.
soccer,Anyone else really bothered by the fact we haven't scored at all today? Robertson and Gomez has sold us down the river but a goal would have slowed down City's momentum at least
TheLastOfUs2,"You're right, that in itself isn't a bad thing but I feel this is one time NB should have made an exception.

I have played all the Uncharted games and the previous TLOU so I know delivering a specific story is NB's M.O but you're essentially a villain twice over in TLOU2 which for many would be too much to handle. This isn't a movie where you're simply seeing the other perspective, here you're acting out every evil act."
TheLastOfUs2,"Technically it is a masterclass of high stakes stealth gameplay and raw, realistic tense environmental game design.

In terms of story, it makes a lot of bold storytelling decisions that are unconventional but not really innovative.

Making the player hate Abby in hopes of redeeming her character arc is something that works better in a movie. Not a game where there is no player agency.

On the topic of player agency, this is what makes games different to other mediums and Naughty Dog didn't bother to explore it. Why force the hand of every move and decision in the game knowing the player won't enjoy it? Where's the innovation in that?

One big missed opportunity is not letting the player decide when to end the cycle of revenge. Give the player a decision, do you want more story or do we end the violence here in return for a story ending? 

Why are WLF letting a pregnant doctore out on patrol to climb walls and engage in gun fights? It wasn't like they were low on soldiers at the time. Just seemed non-sensical to prove some point.

What's the deal with putting all the important story beats after the fact? Telling us Ellie knew all along after she's killed countless ppl. Giving context to Dina and Ellie's relationship once the relationship is over. Giving context to Abby after she does the deed.

Reverse storytelling with no player agency just caused unnecessary controversy for little impact."

PS4,"The mods are human-beings working for free and would like a weekend off constantly checking into this subreddit. That's okay.

PS4,"Just watch some YouTube videos. Honestly, I rather you experience UC4 than burn yourself out playing the previous 3. 

I think overexaggerate the character arcs. Only the Nathan and his wife's relationship holds any significance in 4 because the story is about a new character (his bro). Oh maybe Sully but you spend very little time with Sully in 4. 

The writers wrote UC4 with new players in mind so I wouldn't worry too much. But I do think you're underestimating how well UC2 and UC3 has aged."
Games,"So the Playstation store is doing a sale on some good games. I will most likely get Days Gone at £15.99 then I can't decide between Death Stranding or Red Dead Redemption. 


Both are considered very long, laboursome games with great stories. I really like the soundtrack of DS but I've never played a Kojima game before besides Phantom Pain for 2 hours before I got tired of the credit screens after every mission. Plus the desert is boring to look at. 


I've also never been too big on Rockstar GTA games but maybe thats more to do with the settings. But it's not like I have a particular appetite for cowboy games nor am I against it.


I tend to enjoy open world RPGs my favourites from recent memory are AC: Odyssey and Nier Automata. God of War and HZD were both decent but I foudn their stories not as captivating as everyone else. Also I'm the opposite of a trophy hunter, I will only do quests I have to do so whichever game lets me push the story forward without the side quests would be nice.


Any thoughts would be appreciated."
Games,"Yo, I think you're missing the point.

We can protest against police brutality. It's fully in our control to implement policies. We can't protest against a mindless virus.

Also this is about timing. And I'm sure the delay won't be longer than a couple of weeks so it's important and good morals (and PR) to acknowledge in injustice in society when it's being talked about alot.

Even if Sony hasn't acknowledged other serious issues like HK protests, corporations showing support for ANY cause is nice thing to do. 

A reveal delay on a product that doesn't even have a release date isn't going to ruin anyone's lives but using your platform to spread a positive message may save lives."
Games,"I think you're missing the point in this case. Lots of people die from flu, car accidents, drug addictions, mental health issues and we have awareness days/ events to represent all these.

This delay is because the issue is on everyone's radar. It's happening RIGHT NOW. It is important we use the momentum to address the issue and hopefully move towards change while it is fresh in our minds.

The coronavirus is another major issue being addressed in other ways. It's possible acknowledge multiple serious issues at the same time."

And for that, he should be remembered."
soccer,"> As a Liverpool fan he's literally one of only three ex players I strongly dislike along with Diouf and Owen 

Are you serious? Balotelli was ass on the field but he was a good professional overall and he actually made an effort when he came on, just didn't have the right system to play in. Hate is a strong word for his time at Liverpool and calling them extremely lazy is hyperbole."
Games,"Can't people just enjoy the trailer and not rush to get in their criticisms before there's even a release date? 

""Hidden blade is fan service"" - It's a cinematic trailer, that's the point.

""No gameplay"" - Like pretty much every other entry, gameplay will be shown closer to release date.

""He's not an assassin"" - Well the assassin ship has sailed a long time ago, let's be honest.

""Vikings were bad guys"" - The setting may be historically accurate to a certain extent but the narrative is fiction. 

""Why didn't they kill the women and children in the trailer"" - Please most of us don't want to see a child's head get cut off in a story driven trailer. It's not exactly marketable either.


Without a release date, I'm sure we will get our opportunity to shit on the filler quests, the tired Ubisoft formula, the lack of stealth gameplay, the butchering of the Assassin Creed franchise's name and the selective historical inaccuracies but this is just a ""get hyped up"" trailer to tell us the world we'll be living in."

hiphopheads,"So I've been a MGK fan since Lace Up. He has released several albums and mixtapes and a couple EPs. Most of this sub only discovered him during the Em beef which is unfortunate because you see comments like ""he's not even a rapper, he acts"" or their first time hearing him was ""your beard is weird"" bar and that horrible BINGE EP. When his best music was all before that.

If you're only discovering him now, please visit his Black Flag mixtape and Lace Up to make a fair judgement. General Admission is still nice but I'll put his ""Fuck it"" mixtape over that and his EST 4 Life has a few Hotel Diablo type songs like Halo, Her Song in particular. 

Most fans will agree that Bloom is too poppy but it probably got MGK his biggest cheque considering the numbers the singles did. Hotel Diablo is probably a good blend of his rock star inspired style, aggressive rapping skills and preference to have a pop singer do his hooks. He's just another evolution in his rap career and dialogue but just remember he's a good rapper technically, most definitely above average if you consider what gets upvoted on here sometimes whether you like his personality or not."

There's a difference between complaining about individual games and complaining about a whole season."
soccer,"> luckily Henderson is back in a week or two

Nothing lucky about Henderson being available after the Atletico game. We can win league without him at this point."
soccer,"This is not true before his injury. The issue is the tactical changes Klopp makes to accomodate Fabinho. When he's not on the field, we have two holding midfielders but just him when he starts. When our full backs are always pushing up field, it stretches his responsbilities  across the whole pitch. It's only materialising now because he's not yet ready to shoulder the burden of our players overcommiting."
LiverpoolFC,"Let's talk tactics and theorise why we are in such bad form of recent.


BUT FIRST, just so we're clear, we will win the league comfortably and Atletico at Anfield is pretty much touch-n-go. There's no need to panic (but never unclench).

Now let's talk about our performances...

We're become pretty predictable towards in this final third of this season and in response, teams no longer give us space in-behind to play balls over the top and across the box.
Then they will absorb our attacks and hit us on the counter. Without Wijnaldum and Henderson simulteously covering our full backs, this leaves us unprotected when Fabinho is playing (post-injury).

Something else has also become apparent that's not talked about as much. Our front 3 are no longer linking up. It wouldn't be too wayward to say their chemistry has dried up completely. 
From my perspective, this is what I tend to see each game (I'm generalising so forgive the lack of nuance).

Mane gets the ball, runs to the edge of the box and waits for Robertsont overlap.
Salah gets pinned towards the sideline and releases it to Trent. 
Firmino gets the ball in the middle and tries to 1-2 with a teammate under pressure and the attack crumbles. 

Again, on repeat with slight variations.

Most of the time we prioritise waiting for our fullbacks to join the attack over attacking while the space is available. 
This results in a cross into a congested penalty area followed by a counter attack against our 2 sole defenders. 
Normally Gomez/VVD/Alisson will save us but we've been less lucky in 2020.


Where do we go from here? Ideally our midfielders step up and diversify our attack but suddenly all our bad luck has decided to hit us at once.
Our most in-form midfielder gets injured when 2 Cup competitions are on the line. 
Our most talented defensive midfielder is still feeling the effects of an 8-week injury.
Our most talented attacking midfielder is stuck in a constant cycle of injuries. 
This leaves us with one work horse/ball retention specialist.
One long range specialist who isn't a natural midfielder and 2 aging midfielders who concede fouls in dangerous positions.
Oh, and Minamino.


The optimistic in me says, Fabinho gets over his hump, Ox shows us he can be a consistent midfielder and Firmino is able to fill the creative midfielder void and orchestrate attacks from the middle.

The pragmatic in me says, Fabinho gets dropped with Gini and Milner as a two with Ox slightly ahead. And we do just enough to beat the mid-table teams but lose (on aggregate) to Atletico.

The pessemistic in me says, Fabinho continues to struggle, Keita injuries persist and Minamino never gets a chance to prove his worth until next season. Thus instead of wrapping up the league in March, we leave it a bit later than expected.


God knows why I wrote all this. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk"

The rest is karma whoring."
LiverpoolFC,"I don't think we will count the FA Cup because we know it isn't our strongest line-up. The fanbase will probably save the ""meltdown"" for the Atletico game if we manage to lose that with our main starting 11."
LiverpoolFC,"I wanted to move away from the Lovren blame and Hendo's absence and bring up other issues I've picked up on since the winter break.

Firstly, I rewatched the highlights and realised that Fabinho was very poor for the first 2 goals. 1st one, he lets the player run across him. 2nd failed to block the pass which set up the through ball that led to the goal. Since he's been back in the line-up, he's probably operating at 70% of his abilities which is exposing us defensively. Hopefully he finds his form by the Atletico game.


Another thing is I feel our midfielders have been passing off too much responsibility of creating chances on to TAA? I've seen Gini and Ox on multiple occassions be on the edge of the area and opt for a 5 yard to TAA instead of doing it themselves. Henderson on the other hand has been willing to put the cross in himself. It's a small thing that's been frustrating me because it's predictable given our reputation, puts Trent under pressure as the defender has more time to close him and allows oppositions defence to settle and block the cross. We need to diversify our attacks and stop treating TAA as a get out of jail card."
LiverpoolFC,"I would like to see Lallana, Minamino and Keita (if he isn't injured) get game time in midfield to see who looks capable of stepping up in Henderson's absence. 

Also if Curtis Jones starts and puts in another great performance could be our go-to forward sub alongside Origi as Shaqiri seems pretty much lost to the shadow realm at this point."

Secondly, what's the point of being rich and young if you can't have fun (without taking the piss of course)? He doesn't have to binge drink like an British uni student when he goes out. Just drink soda, dance to music and be home by midnight. Saying he can't go out and party during the season is essentially a 9 month night curfew.

Maybe the Ballon d'or clause is ridiculous but I see nothing wrong with the unlikely CL clause even if United has little chance of securing a spot. If you're in-charge of making transfers why would you sanction a player transfer over £70M that didn't have CL related clauses because if you're spending that much then competing in Europe is the end goal no? On the flipside I can understand that one player cannot turn an average team into a top tier but is that individual transfer worth that price if you don't become a top tier team competing in Europe? This all means nothing if Bruno is worth the £80M Sporting Lisbon is claiming without add-ons but that isn't the case though is it?"

Most fans expected Origi to be non-existent for the first 85 minutes but didn't expect him also not turn up in ""Origi time"" to secure us a win. At least Klopp threw on Salah, Firmino and Ox to try force a victory so he cares a little.

Secondly, senior players playing in the FA Cup means we risk not just tiredness but injuries that may not completely derail our season with the gap we have secured but will affect our CL chances if a key player rolls his ankle in a FA Cup game. So for all those wanting to risk a prestigous double to brag about securing a treble understand we need our players in full health to win the CL games first before we think about getting the treble."

LiverpoolFC,"> He’s never been an avid passer 

He has become more selfish overtime, that's the issue. No problem with him being selfish but he has become mroe selfish than in previous seasons. The change has been progressive but the change is evident.

> this is the mentality that consistently creates chance after chance

If he converted more of these chances where he is being selfish, then we wouldn't get on to him. Also this mentality isn't why he racks up goal contributions, it's his off-ball movement and agility, not his selfish acts to take on players and shoot in unfavourable positions.

> Mane was selfish the previous game and people said fuck all. 

You're better than that. We all know Salah has become more selfish than team mates. As I said, being selfish is fine if it's justifiable but he picks bad times to shoot, whether he's off balance, multiple players blocking the goal, teammate in a better position and his shooting technique isn't exactly top 5 in the world (being a world class goalscorer isn't the same as shooting technique/range).


Where there's smoke, there's fire so I understand defending Salah but don't pretend some criticism isn't justified. Let's be more nuanced than that. We are all watching the same games. Happy to discuss this further."

Everytime I watch Messi, his ability is alien. Technically I think Messi is a huge margin above everyone else. I don't know how I would be able to dribble past players the way he does. How he makes everything seem so effortless. Whereas I can see a path towards achieving all of Ronaldo's attributes > smart runs, positioning, shooting. Also Ronaldo always looks like he's busting a gut, always psyching himself up. It's all very in your face, how he goes about achieving what he does on the pitch. But Messi? I see him work magic and I'm left confused, it's all a mystery. Yes, Ronaldo is tall but you see average players winning headers all the time."
soccer,Last season I used to be skeptical of seeing Wijnaldum and Henderson on the same team sheet because their roles would overlap too much. This season they are my favourites as they seem to have ironed out their responsibilities a lot more clearly and their 2019 CL form is materialising in our recent league games after a milding patchy start. I wouldn't be surprised to see Fabinho back in the line-up on Thursday so we can rest players but getting those on the team sheet as much as possible is key to maintain our current form.

LiverpoolFC,"Our forwards taking turns tracking back. Last game Mane did most of it, in other cases it's Firmino which he is known for and everyone remembers Origi's last minute track back to cut out a goal scoring opportunity.

The actual reason is that he doesn't pick players on form and if he does, he doesn't play them enough. We need a manager who is willing to pick ANY player that fits their system unfortunately Southgate will do as every other manager and rely on media favourites.

2. Usain Bolt and Traore have completely different builds, Usain benefits from having very long legs for a sprinter.

3. Usain Bolt isn't a juicer. Sorry but that's a wild unfounded claim to make of a guy of his stature. You might as well say every sprinter is doping which is a whole different discussion.

soccer,People saying it's impossible for a defender to win Ballon d'Or while Messi exists. Can someone quantify what a defender must do to win Ballon d'Or?
LiverpoolFC,Firmino hasn't been playing well at all lately but I do think Salah has been carrying an injury.
LiverpoolFC,"> ""For example, in training a rule can be that a goal counts only when all the players have crossed the halfway line""

High line forever baby"
Android,"In the UK , where?"
hiphopheads,This album slapping multiple times harder than Born 2 Rap
LiverpoolFC,"Klopp please, give my boy Ox a starting spot in midfield. 

Also Lallana Redemption Arc incoming?"
LiverpoolFC,"constructive criticism = fraud fans? Got it. 

You do know fans can enjoy tactical analysis of a performance whilst being happy the team got the result?"
soccer,"""The evil you have done is enough"""
soccer,"We also tend to put it poor performances against Napoli, I don't think I've agreed with any of Klopp's tactics each time we face them. Not mitigating the absence of Trent with a creative midfielder really cost us because Ox changed the game once he came on."
soccer,"> Liverpool are relentless.

We really wasn't on Wednesday, the intensity was off by a lot without TAA pinging those crosses in."
soccer,"> I can absolutely see why some people would think Premier League players dope.

Yeah but I'm asking if he has any evidence.

> And Ox pumping steroids wouldnt help his cruciate ligament.

But OP is trying to say, doping helps with injuries.

I'm trying to piece together how OP feels a squad of injury-free and injury prone players are all doping. Why would the starting line up all dope and not the rest of the squad if the claim is ""Liverpool are doping"" or ""every club in the PL are doping""."
hiphopheads,Holy shit this guitar riffs on this
soccer,"Got any evidence? Hard to imagine players like Milner and Salah agreeing to dope. 

Also explain how Matip, Lovren, Gomez, Keita, Ox, Lallana, Shaqiri are doping and still pick up more injuries than everyone else?"
soccer,From a business point of value I find it interesting how a club can pay millions for a player and not demand heavy restrictions around the player's lifestyle to ensure a good return on their investment.
soccer,I love Robbo but habits die hard and it's shitty behaviour that doesn't fit our team's personality.
soccer,"Considering our away form (before last 16), how ugly we've been playing this season, Fabinho's injury, our stacked December schedule, their current form then yeah the odds are better than anyone will give them credit for."
soccer,If you're a professional athlete most likely unless your nutritionist says otherwise or you're intermittent fasting. Us normal folks can skip it.
LiverpoolFC,"> All complaints about performance could have gone out of the window if two massive calls went our way.

This idea you can't constructively criticise the performance because you got the result you wanted is bullshit. Winning ugly isn't sustainable nor is it fun to watch guys."
soccer,He did it against Kyle Walker and our fans lapped it up. A bit ironic aye.
hiphopheads,"Corbyn was close but she still won.....might not have been a conservative majority but it was enough to beat Corybn. People hate the guy, it's insane how the media has sabotaged his image"
soccer,"Our team performance was just as bad, I rather focus on that tbh."
soccer,"Our fans are not ready for that conversation yet. Gotta wait to lose a few games so fans don't hit you with ""we still won"" rebuttals."
soccer,"Same unnecessary shithousery our fans praise Robertson for gets him in trouble with the red. He just needs to cut it out, I personally don't find it endearing at all man."
Games,"""Buy"" -ACG - My boy getting the respect he deserves. 

Also I've only 5 hours in and it has a lot of potential and mystery. Hopefully I come across characters with a bit more personality than the ones I've encountered thus far though.

fitbit,"> If you tell it you’re going on a run, it will show you a map of where you ran (might even improve your soccer awareness!)

So I can wear it during a football match and it can tell me how many miles I ran in during my time on the pitch?"
hiphopheads,"Tory probably gonna clean up this election due to how Jeremy Corbyn is misrepresented by the media. I have never seen such a persistent smear campaign like the one the British media has brought upon this guy over the last 4 years. No matter what he does, he's an anti-semite, traitor to his country and incompetent leader even though there's no direct evidence to support any of this. Whereas the bluddering Boris is seen as a charismatic leader inspite of his track record of writing racist newspaper articles, phone calls asking for a journalist to be assaulted and political accolades even given his time as Mayor of London. 

To be fair to both sides, neither candidate are good candidates, both lack any sort of self-awareness of how they are perceived and fail to counter the arguments to make the opposition hate them so much. 

The difference is Boris offers clarity in he will deliver Brexit with or without a deal, the status quo and isn't making million promises which seem unrealistic whereas Corbyn's stance is unclear and is promising everything under the moon. 


Strategically, Boris has the upper hand because they both feed into the public perception and Boris is the safe bet.

soccer,"We could honestly field Lallana and Milner in this line-up if Ox, Keita, Shaqiri are all fit tbh"
soccer,MENTALITY MONSTERS
soccer,"Our players will be in a better position to cross the ball but will prioritise passing to Trent, giving the opposition time to read the cross :/"
soccer,"Hat-trick hero Wijnaldum has had 16 touches this half, another typical away game performance without his lucky orange shirt :( 

On the flip side, tactically we've been all wrong. Ox isn't effective on the wing, our front 3 are being under-utilised and relying on TAA is making us too predictable. I smell a Keita cameo coming on."
Android,"Hi all, I got a few questions.

**1. S10(+) or OnePlus 7 (Pro)**

I'm stuck between S10 and OnePlus7 and here are the factors affecting my decision:

* I hear the UK version of S10s Exynos is laggy and slow whilst the OnePlus OS is fast.

* But I hear the One UI 2.0 beta is getting positive reception, does this fix Samsung's slow UI?

* OnePlus' support/customer service isn't as reliable as say bigger manufacturers like Samsung. There are also Samsung shops where I work in London that would be helpful if I did have issues

* Build quality? I always use a phone case so I don't think it's a big issue right?

* A friend has a OP7 Pro and says the battery life is getting worst after 7 months. Thoughts?

* Price isn't a factor because I'm getting it on contract

* I try to avoid the biggest phones - my previous phones were iPhone 7 (current) and Sony Xperia Compact - Hence why I haven't been looking too closely at S10+/OP7Pro unless I'm seriously missing out. Is the difference in performance that big between the normal and the plus/pro versions?

* Are there any other Androids I should be seriously looking at? I only want the best.

* If you're wondering why I'm moving away from Apple, it's because I don't like using iTunes to transfer files and I only use Google services not even iCloud.

* If there's no good Black Friday deals, when's the best time to upgrade?

* Main apps I use - Google Maps, Google Keep, Camera, Social Media, Google Chrome


**2. I know it's an android forum but thoughts on iPad Mini compared to other small tablets?**

I think I'm ready to invest in a good tablet after buying cheap ones that die after 1-2 years and get laggy real fast.

Important factors to consider for my purchase:

* I commute everyday to work and want a device I can write on Google Doc/Google Sheet/make notes on PDF.

* I will be transfering videos, images and text files a lot between my laptop and iPad. Are there any roadblocks I should be aware of considering I don't like using iTunes/iCloud?

* I stand up for 40 minutes on my journey home hence why I've leaned to iPad Mini, I can fit it more easily in one hand if I'm squeezed up against other passengers.

* I will be investing in a keyboard+pen to accompany my tablet/iPad - any recommendations?

* (potential) Main apps I will be using - PDF editing app, Manga reading app, Google Suite, Python programming (might just use web browser or Google Colab), Social Media scheduling, Google Chrome

LiverpoolFC,I think it's just that Alisson gets complacent very easily. I doubt he would be making errors  in important games because he would switched on due to the occasion.
soccer,Have you negotiated salary for a new job role before? That's one of hooks you can use. I guess the world of football is no different.
soccer,"Are we talking throughout a whole season because then we gotta take into consideration his away form in the league. Don't get me wrong, he's a big game player and unstoppable at Anfield but he's invisible in a lot of away fixtures. He's clutch because he's scored a lot of vital goals for us but he's consistency is frustrating."
Games,DA:I came out fine compared to Andromeda and Anthem though.
soccer,I find it hard to believe players like Milner are doping.
LiverpoolFC,Trent defensively has been fantastic this season. Anytime he's out of position is because we're hit on a counter from an attack he's instigated. We can't expect him to be at both sides of the field at the same time.
hiphopheads,Someone iron Pusha's jacket
