subreddit,body
boardgames,"I get your concern, but the issue is, if they allow recommendation posts on the general subreddit, it would be FLOODED with them. It's not ideal, but i think as is, is the best solution.

Similarly, with underrated games, the point is to ensure its not just a list. EX: ""what are some underrated games of 2020?"" Answers: Lists. Instead, ""what are some underrated games of 2020, going into detail on them, with me, OP, explaining why i think XYZ is underrated"", ok. because its discussion based."
askgaybros,"I dunno. A few, maybe 3 so far? It realy depends. The last guy I just sucked wanted me to go down on it, seemingly hard, which I tried but I got tired. I liked it but it's hard to continously gag on a cock. Maybe I should ask them to be more vocal on what they like. I just worry it may be a requirement to deep throat it"
askgaybros,"Yeah, though if it helps at all, I do it anon, so they sometimes just dissaper after. I'll try to get more feedback from the future.

As with the other guy though, jerking confuses me. Half the guys I blow get upset if I jerk too much, but I also want them to cum. I dunno. Should I ask them to be more verbal in what they want? Ie, suck my balls, now jerk me, now suck my cock, now jeke me?"
askgaybros,"It's a possibility for sure. I've made some guys cum, others give up. I don't mind if they can't cum, or take a while but I'm not gonna suck them that long in thay case. I love blowjobs but I personally get bored after 5-10 mins, in addition to being tired. Is it ok to tell a guy I'll only suck him that long?"
askgaybros,"See, that confuses me. I try to add hand jobs into it but guys tell me to stop and just use my mouth. Is it that they don't wanna cum yet?"
askgaybros,"No one has, but I guess there's a possibility that's part of it. The issue comes down to if I'm trying to get it all down its hard to pay attention to teeth as well. No ones ever said it, but I guess that may be part of it. But I don't think that's it fully."
askgaybros,Yeah because I'm totally jusy chomping down on a guys cock.
Games,"The original I, think, is single player only but a bit unsure. 

For some more detail as well, It's from a top down perspective and you basically pick characters to open rooms, with each room usually containing a few enemies to bash, along with power, resources, loot, etc. The more rooms you open, the more stuff you get, but you need the lights on or else enemies continously spawn. There's nowhere near enough power to light up every room, and when you go to the next floor, basically the enemies turn into an endless swarm, and any dark room spawns a lot ofem. It's tough but fantastic. And cheap as hell on sale."
Games,I'd argue endless dungeon is not l4D. It's more of a dungeon crawling rogue like with tower defense and rogue like elements.
Games,"If it's anything like the original, it's a mix of dungeon crawler with tower defense and resource management (power for turrets, resources to make turrets, etc). The original was very good."
boardgames,"For curiosities sake, is the ""certain point"" part something you can add on with a rule? IE, tainted grail and the >!mini traveling menhir!< or is it something that MUST be unlocked through progression that would break the game if you didnt?"
boardgames,"I played the base game, and i liked it, but felt like the deckbuilding was a bit samey. I ended up selling it, though i absolutely loved how it felt like the videogame. Should i have gotten the ""special edition"" and royalty expansions?"
askgaybros,"For the ones i linked, they do have PDF and (some) physical versions on the website, classcomics.com. But i'm looking for some of their out of print ones."
askgaybros,Sadly they only have physical versions of some. I was looking for more. But they are super hot.
boardgames,"The lack of mitigation was a super turn off for me. The rest of the game, especially theme, was great, but when it came down to it, it was just ""roll two dice, add +x, MAYBE reroll (for a hefty cost) oops, you failed, sucks. It's all very boring ""+X stat"" and rerolls were a pain in the butt to get. If you (OP) are ok with that, i'd highly recommend it, but be wary if youre unsure.

Also, and this is neither positive/negative per se, it's best solo. Im happy to only play solo, but for others, it may depend."
comicbooks,"Nope. Iv'e honestly not heard of it.

Fair. It's pretty graphic so I was wary of posting it. It's the Porky series by Logan Kowalsky. I'm honestly interested in all of his comics (his art style is fantastic), i just cannot for the life of me find half of his stuff."
comicbooks,"I'd rather not say the name of it tbh, but it's very graphic, so i'm not surprised i'm not finding it many places."
comicbooks,"Theres a series, and then some others by the same person/company, but all either 15, or less, years old. It's more graphic then sunstone, and i sadly could not find it on instocktrades, checking just now."
boardgames,"Its interesting because iv'e heard really mixed reviews on it, though i do wonder if its just that its ""multiplayer solitaire""."
boardgames,"Game first for sure, but not always.

For me, it kinda depends. Am I hanging out with friends, who may or may not be boardgamers? Sure I'll play something light (I have exceptions like social deduction but still). Theres no focus on the activity, it's just the people. 

Am I doing a game night? Game first. If I'm coming to play boardgames, in particular, I'm not gonna play something I dislike. That includes a lot of lighter games (not all). For me, I do care about the people, and I'm happy to talk, I can multi-task, but at the end of the day, if I wanted to talk with said people, I'd hangout and do a random activity or make it known I jusy wanna hangout, vs 'I wanna play a boardgame'. 

That said, I would argue there can be an issue of game first, especially at flgs. The people there are very focused on the game. And it may be a game I enjoy, but if I want to make friends, or join their group, it can be a lot harder due to the lack of talking. 

On the other hand, if it's a 'boardgame event' at a bar or something, typically it's people first, which is great for friends, but not great for the games. They're typically, light, party, or social deduction which, for me at least, doesn't work out. I'm happy to go to make a friend, but I won't neccesarily expect them to be a friend I play boardgames with since they're typically, similarly, people first vs game first. 

I think a lot of people are both, but I always think it's fascinating seeing others see this idea of people, or game, first, and how they discuss it."
Games,"Agreed. I mean, hell, last year was far better to me."
Games,"Something, anything on Bayonetta 3. It's been what, two years since it got announced? And not a peep since."
askgaybros,I'm jealous.
askgaybros,"Yeah thats a good point. I think something to maybe force myself to do, is to continue to be in the mood, or try to. I cum with porn, why not finish the porn i was watching, try and pull it a bit longer i guess?"
askgaybros,"Yeah that's for me. It's a switch flipped. I'm instantly not into it. It's frustrating, but i think the best way is to just, well, not cum until the guy does."
askgaybros,"For that ""cum and continue"", how does that work? Is it just kinda forcing it at first, and as the refractory period goes away, it gets better?"
askgaybros,What if you're topping? Is it the same idea?
askgaybros,"I love sucking dick, but my God. More then 10, maybe 15 mins, and I'm good. For an hour? My throat would be so sore. And I'd be bored. But I'm jealous of you guys who are into that."
boardgames,"Same, except i'm bad at them. I'll say coup is the only one i actually like and would play, and its on the edge of being a no go. Anything else, no sir.

Now REGULAR deduction (IE, cryptid) im happy with."
boardgames,"I'm very happy they still have the lcg going.... But I also am very aware ffg is getting chopped off, slowly but surely, and am gonna be watching for any signs of arkham lcg being next. I feel bad for xwing and such minis people. This must suck."
boardgames,"How is replay ability? One person seemed to mention it being like the AHLCG: IE, you ""know"" how the scenario works, but different paths are available and its still a puzzle of surviving the scenario/accomplishing your goal."
askgaybros,"Are you open? No problem at all.

Not open and 100% monogamous? That's 100% cheating in my book."
boardgames,"Does it make it more recommendable? The biggest part of cloudspire i heard was the rulebook stuff. Though, having played a round of it, i didnt love some of the stuff (like you must, always, more forward, and the random event stuff)"
boardgames,Ooooo. I wanted to get cloudspire but was turned off by that. Do you think I should look into the updated version?
boardgames,"What do you mean by the difference? Like, has cloudspire changed with his input and made it a bit better?"
boardgames,"Dunno how no ones posted a link, but here it is: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chiptheorygames/burncycle"
PiercedCock,Supposedly the original piercer made the hole too close to the outside or something.
askgaybros,"Did you ever send your face/body/anything to guys?

Did you typically use grindr, scruff, or others?

I also have one ive used (wooden one in a one bedroom basement suite). It's fun but can be frustrating at times."
piercing,"That's what I was afraid of, but i'll be checking it out. Do you know how I should broach the subject? Like, something in the sense of wounds taking a while to heal?"
piercing,"Thats the issue, it didn't heal quickly. I got initial piercing in January, took it out end of may, it's now November, and it's still not healed."
piercing,"The hole itself. The TLDR is that the original piercer made the hole too big, or too close to the outside, or something, so it needs to ""heal"" so i can repierce it. 

Right now, I don't have one. It ""was"" a barbell, unsure on the gauge and such. The main question is more so if i should A. Wait for it to heal and go back (unsure when) B. Ask about stitches (really would feel weird in a lot of ways) or C. Leave it be and not bother with the piercing."
boardgames,"I really don't understand everyone trying to stop their legacy games from being permanently altered. That's... Literally the point of it. If you don't want to permanently alter the game, get a different one."
Games,"It looks absolutely adorable and I love it. And the gameplay seems solid too, with a bunch of various goals and scenarios (picking up fruit from a crane, pulling out levers to fill a lake, swinging around on vines, etc)"
boardgames,"It depends for me. It's a mixture of mechanics (does it have stuff I like, IE, bidding, or stuff I dont like, IE, lots of dice) what do ""general"" reviewers think (Space Biff, SUSD, Boardgame Barrage being some of my preferred reviewers) and finally, what do people who have PLAYED it think? BGG reviews, but honestly, more so discord communities i'm in (""what does everyone think on X""), which helps when I play, talk, and learn what others are into. I'd argue though, its mostly the last one. Everyone may rave about game A, but if i have friends who are similar in game interests to me, and they HATE game A, i probably wont like it either."
SexToys,"This is really good info, thank you."
SexToys,"If you dont mind me asking, how long is ""temporary""? Like, iv'e seen some guys go multiple (3+ months) without it. Would it take a while to ""unshrink"" or would it depend?"
boardgames,"If youre in canada, they have it at boardgame bliss, but besides that, the only place iv'e seen it (in the US) is on their website, as Xylus 1985 linked."
Games,"Id recommend Sea, hesitantly. It's gameplay has some major issues, but its story is great. I'd recommend skies over Sea, though both if you like the story, though skies gameplay is a LOT better."
askgaybros,"Appreciated. Sadly, I think i'll have to pass on making my own then. Thank you."
Games,"It's probably my second favorite game this year (albeit, this year is fairly weak imo... but still). It's aesthetic and theme is nuts, its mystery is genuinely interesting, its music is unlike anything iv'e heard before, it's world is just fucking nuts, and its gameplay, well, its rough but it has a LOT of heart and that makes up for the issues for me."
askgaybros,"I do try to mix it up (suck the balls, focus on the tip, deepthroat a bit) and it helps, but at the end of the day, its still sucking dick and i just kinda want him to cum and go."
askgaybros,"That may be it, partially at least. These are anonymous hookups."
askgaybros,"Yeah this is basically me. I love sucking dick, but eventually i'm just like ""ok, im kinda ready for you to cum now...""."
vancouver,"East Vancouver, but if there's a really great one further out, I'm happy to travel."
boardgames,"Vastly prefer option A vs B (less luck, higher difficulty) but it can depend. If theres a good bit of luck, i want ways to mitigate it. For example, too many bones has a lot of luck in its dice rolls at times, but the reason i like it is A. theres ways to mitigate it (items, other dice to affect other dice) and b. you can, typically, use SOME result in some regard. EX: I roll die A. I get bones (0). They get put into my 'back up plan' which, after i get X bones, i can use as a free ability (testless damage, heal, etc). Or, maybe i really wanted to roll a 5 on damage but i rolled a 4. That's ok, i can still USE the 4 for damage (vs games like eldritch horror or darkest night where its ""get result A/B or FAIL"" which drives me bonkers). Also, stuff like spirit island and gloomhaven, card based with a biiit of luck (spirit islands event deck/invaders random invasion deck) or gloomhavens +/- damage is generally ok because i need to anticipate that and it's not (excluding gloomhavens null damage, which i do dislike) just ""oh you drew X, you fail automatically.

OR, the arkham horror card game. The chaos bag (Draw token, vs roll die) gives you a lot more options then just ""i need to roll an X or i lose"" its more ""well i can afford ABC to draw, but EF are bad, and G id win, but id have bad thing happen"" PLUS it gives you ways to mess with the chaos bag and ADD to your value in a lot more ways then, typically, just +stat though it does have that.  All of these im ok with rough difficulty because i A. have lots of options iv'e picked for myself (too many bones skill die, gloomhavens cards, arkhams premade deck) and B. ways to mitigate said luck even if theres still the chance i draw ""the bad thing that causes me to fail"" (and at that point, i probably should've prepared better)."
Games,"It's an incredibly weird game. It's a mix of open world exploration and visual novel talking. It's a mystery game, but you can figure it out by just ""finding everything"" and its pretty (IMO) open and close. It's a little janky, and not super long (took me maybe 8 hours?)... But, it's incredible. It's aesthetic is insane, its music is fantastic, its world is kooky and fascinating, and it's easily one of my favorite games this year despite its flaws. I'd highly recommend it, keeping in mind its weirdness."
boardgames,"You can jump onto someone elses pledge once the pledge manager opens again, but overall, yeah, KS only."
boardgames,"Maybe i'm just being ""that guy"" but i feel kinda weird with how they're HEAVY on ""it's unpolticial"" but they have basically ""Democrats vs Republicans"" in image (donkey and elephant) and color (red+blue). It doesn't affect me buying/not buying it, just seems a bit off."
truegaming,"Giants deep gives me legitimate... Dread. Like, dark bramble is spooky for sure, and leaves me on edge, and what's inside brittle hollow also gives me anxiety... But giants deep, the tornadoes, the water, it just gives me this immense dread that few other games have given me."
askgaybros,"Yeah it really comes down to, do i want to take that additional risk, X times a week, on top of what i normally do? 3 times a week is a lot, some people go to the gym 5 times. Thats even more. Even if the risk isnt as much as other activities, its still really tough for me to justify. And god knows if they'll just shut down again in a month due to cases rising."
boardgames,"Surprised you didn't say the, basically, spiritual successor to it: cthulhu wars. Yes its got big honking chunks of plastic you push across a ginormous map and roll a ton of dice for, but it's also got immense asymmetry thats super fun."
boardgames,"There's a small one, but its not very active, and iv'e always had more luck with ""US wide"" (when i lived there) over ""my state"" groups."
boardgames,Oh awesome. Would you be able to send me the link for that?
Games,"Also on PC game pass and, i think, xbox as well."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"It does make it easier to justify the cost, but at the end of the day, I'd like to say Im still willfully paying for it, and am happy to do so. I mean, honestly, I don't love how expensive it is, but I accept it due to how much I enjoy the game. I've spent a ton of money on splotter games, chip theory games, out of print games. I'm happy to pay the cost if I enioy it enough.

In the rarity aspect, I'm pretty positive it's a problem ffg doesn't like to have and is very much exacerbated by covid and such. They get nothing out of rarity of packs, unlike say magic."
sex,Yeah i suspect there may be something here but unsure. I talked to a therapist about it but it never really came to anything.
Games,"For sure, and I did as well, but i'd argue skies is the better game mechanically, and if someones gonna play one, id recommend skies. But seas is very good."
Games,"Id hesitate to recommend sunless sea, due to its gameplay being kinda flawed. I had a great time, with cheat engine (AKA, giving myself max stats+double speed) but i love the world/lore. I'd recommend skies over sea a lot more due to that, and sea works a lot better if youve played fallen london. Skies is kinda its own thing more than seas is. TLDR: hesitantly recommend seas, highly recommend skies."
vancouver,How much do you make OP? Because im doing just fine at easily HALF 150K...
boardgames,"I think this is honestly it. I wanted to play nemos war one time and after weeks of just staring at it, finally did it. While i ultimately didn't enjoy nemos war itself, i did enjoy the fact of playing something."
sex,"I appreciate all of this help. I'm in Canada so things should be ""easier"" but we'll see. Thank you."
sex,I havent. Iv'e heard this occasionally but never really thought about it. Should i ask my doctor about it? And would they be ok just running a test on it?
sex,I don't take any.
sex,"It wasnt too high when i checked last, its always been like this. The period i guess, and the ""bleh"" after."
sex,"I don't, though it isnt always a whole day, it really kinda depends I guess. But yeah, the food stuff may be hurting things."
rpg,"Appreciated, I'll delete this and check out that thread, thank you."
gainit,"If you dont mind me asking, for deadlifts and the bar, what did you do to replace not being able to lift it?"
askgaybros,I'll try that out. Thanks man.
askgaybros,"Do you just push it back until you gag, then stop, or do you ""hold it"" for a few seconds after you gag?"
askgaybros,Do you just keep pushing further back everyday?
boardgames,"It's not going to break the bank but I'm still gonna be pretty ticked off that . Putting a drink on a side table is ridiculously easy. I literally have these two little foot and a half by foot and a half tables I just put by players. 4 players, two tables. If more, I break out more. Put drink on table, easy."
boardgames,"For all these stories... Why not just have a, side table with drinks? There's no way I'm letting anyone put a drink near my 50, 60+ dollar game, though most do understand the cost and are careful."
Games,"Sure. I'm going to post the top ""negative"" review that has me wary.

/quote:

Quoted: ""I love this game, I really do. I have had many good moments with this game, however I honesty don't know if I can recommend it. I might change this at a later date, but this game has sent me into an uncomfortable rage one too many times.

The problem with this game is that much of the time, it's impossible. I don't mean ""it's difficult"", I mean at times it is literally impossible. The difficulty rating is more like a chance meter, as in, it shows how likely you are to run into bad RNG which makes the hours you've played pointless. The problem with this game comes from it's main gimmick, everything is decided with dice. You can do everything perfectly, and still lose because the enemy rolled two sixes three times in a row.

RNG in games can be good, but that sort of thing, where your perfect run is halted by some lucky slime, happens a lot. I've lost on the first floor, even though every one of my moves were the best they could have been, because of factors entirely outside of my control. This is the most infuriating thing in any game, losing because of things the player has no say over. It makes it feel so unfair, like you have no reason to try, like you've learned nothing out of your failure to not roll high (or low) enough, like you've been cheated out of what you deserve, and like you've wasted your time playing the game. If you come out of a game feeling like you've wasted your time, then there is something wrong with that game.

This is a game where you need to feel like you're progressing. Having to restart over, and over, is so demotivating in a game like this; where the pickups you find in the first couple floors are so weak and repetitive. There are a lot of different moves and plays you can do in this game, but most of the time you will end up doing exactly the same thing everytime you play the same die. There is variety, but the game doesn't give you it. Each dice has a very small selection of different items that appear in chests on the first couple of floors. Meaning when you have to restart for the 5th time because you played as best as you possibly could've, with no room to improve, you are going to be given the exact same weak items you know inside and out how to use. This makes the game incredibly repetitive and boring.

It almost feels like this game is purposely engineered to force you into despair, as repetition, boredom, feeling like there's no point in progressing, feeling like every second of my time is being wasted, and having no control over the things that defeat me are the whole reason I need to distract myself by playing games.""

This concerns me i guess, of not enough control. I like dice in my games, but mitigation is key, and it sounds like there isn't enough of it?"
Games,Iv'e been really wary on this one. It seems great but the top review mentions it being iffy. Any thoughts on it?
arkhamhorrorlcg,This feels a loooot like a R relationships problem and not something to be discussed here...
vancouver,I can link you their facebook page as well. The guy who owns it responds fairly quickly.
vancouver,"Core Games in Brentwood mall. They have the best prices, close to online ones, and a lot lower than msrp like others do."
Fitness,"I'm sure this has been asked a loooot but i cant seem to find it so i'll ask here;

What if i'm too weak to lift the bar in stuff such as deadlifts? Iv'e tried in the past but the 40 pound bar is just too much for me. What can i do instead? And potentially more broadly speaking, what if im too weak to do say a pull up, a chin up, a push up? The beginner routines don't really go over what to do in that case. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
askgaybros,"This is a very hard lesson to drill into my thick skull. It's immensely frustrating, especially if hes my type. But at the end of the day, for me, its about effort. I dont mind if he doesnt respond when i say hi, and i get it if hes busy, but if i CONSTANTLY ask to hangout and keep trying and just... dont? Why bother? Drop it, delete the number, and move on."
LifeAfterSchool,"Agreed. Stuff like that helps a lot, but it also feels like im kinda wasting time ""now""."
LifeAfterSchool,Yeah that's the current goal.
LifeAfterSchool,"For sure. I think this is my biggest thing. What to do. There's so many hobbies to try, places to travel. I just need ideas sometimes, ya know?"
LifeAfterSchool,"In a lot of ways, its great. I have money for stuff, i have a job, i have a place to live on my own... But it also feels weird. Like, ok, now what? Whats my goal, what do i do now? I dont even mean a legacy per se, i just want something to work towards."
Games,"As someone who just beat it, i can agree with all of this immensely. It's fucking weird, it's aesthetic is insane, and it's utterly fantastic."
LifeAfterSchool,"I've seen it, on reddit. Id have to Google it, but I know exactly what you mean. It fits what I am to a T right now. And how I've been after graduation."
askgaybros,"Sure. I dunno if its just a bad pic or if its just guys arent into ""stocky"" guys."
askgaybros,"Its a possibility. Or, maybe i'm just ""stocky"" and not realizing it. No idea tbh."
askgaybros,"Huh. Fair enough. I guess i'd be considered 'stocky"" then. The thing is though, when i had it, i had a guy tell me ""youre not stocky"". So its kinda confusing..."
boardgames,"My concern is how good the gameplay will be of the surviving part. The puzzles were cool, exploring the island was cool, even restarting was fine, with the knowledge of where to go and how to do it...

BUT, I felt like the actual survival gameplay was weak. It turned into a milling game of keeping a few tutor cards (aka, find X card in stack or discard pile to deal with obstacle ABC) which was... Fine but not great. I like the idea a lot, and I hope they do well with it, but they need to add more depth imo."
Games,"Unsure how you can review it considering it's early access. I mean, you can of course, but it should be stated in the title that it's early access iko."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I know it's a joke, but I think they're going for mind, for knowledge (not neccesarily strong willed, which id attribute to willpower) and agility for body (sneaky, vs punchy)"
Games,"I'm not surprised, the gameplay didn't look great... But the music, the graphics, the dialogue, and the diversity overall ALL look great."
vancouver,Easy. Smooth. No problems. Same with Lyft.
vancouver,Why's that?
UNCCharlotte,"I'd expect the entire semester for fall, MAYBE spring, to be online. While i'm not in college anymore, graduated like, a year and a half ago, i still follow along. And honestly, it sucks. It really does. But its best to be safe and be online then not."
UNCCharlotte,"Again, I really don't see why anyone thinks uncc isn't getting shut down in, maybe, the first week if not less. It's happening and you all really should plan for it."
askgaybros,"I feel ya buddy. Im in vancouver and absolutely loved going to steamworks, i went at least twice a month, sometimes more. It suuuucks not being able to go :("
vancouver,"As a tenant, Jesus christ this is overkill. Definintely protect yourself op, but the things I've been asked for generally speaking are landlord references, proof of employment (pay stubs or call my employer, potentially both), credit check (do not ask for SIN, that's illegal) and general 'how many people will live here' 'do you have pets' etc. Definintely ask for a small paragraph on the person, but don't ask for a whole fucking letter."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"For what its worth, I completely agree on the chaos bag... In theory. Id argue that the reason I love it though is that, yes theres always a chance for the game to tell you ""no"" and auto fail, or a horrible draw... But you have so many ways to affect the outcome before you draw a token. Committing stuff such as last chance, where you can get +5 if you have 0 cards left in your hand, using mystic spells to boost your willpower, using survivor cards that are ok if you fail by X. It gives you so much more choice and decision making, even if it is still possible for luck to screw you over."
vancouver,Whats the west end considered?
vancouver,"I've been checking ah a lot. Like, hourly if not sooner due to my time crunch. So hopefully I'll just happen upon something great. Unfortunately, timing wise, it's not looking good for me, but it's good advice for others/for next month."
vancouver,"My main thing is enforcement. Lets say kids dont have one on. Or, one takes it off during the class. What does the teacher do? Send them to the office? what if the parents throw a fit? In THEORY, BC will back the teachers, but im wary of believing that, going off the stories i read in r/teachers and professors."
vancouver,"Maybe i'm reading too much into it, but i feel like downtown is a bit sketchy, and noisy, from everything iv'e heard."
vancouver,"Damn. I didn't realize it was that intense. Iv'e never had an issue before, all of my 3 previous places were pretty easy... I guess this is just how it ""normally"" is."
vancouver,Yeah.
vancouver,"Understandable, as frustrating as it may be. 

Oh yeah, references are all great. Like, iv'e got literally anything they need; pay stubs, references from multiple places ive lived before, work contact number. I say i have it in the initial email. The issue is, im just being delayed i guess. Like, im down to send it all, send application, and sign today, but its just not happening for anywhere it seems. I expect ill have to move in with family because my options are either A. sign a year lease in somewhere i DONT want or B. move in, wait (hopefully) there, and then move into a new place..."
vancouver,"One I preferred it to be in PDF vs paper. And the other, I dont have a BCID but offered alternatives. I guess thats on me though, frustrating as it may be."
vancouver,"I do that, i think. Im quiet, i have a job (i say which field) etc etc. I mention providing any references required, etc. But yeah, dunno."
vancouver,"Yeah, I realize its pretty late. I tried in the begining, found a place, it fell through, now i'm scrambling to find something and it's just slow. Like, two places, iv'e seen them, ive got the application, i need to ask for clarification on one thing for both, silence. I need an answer. Grah."
vancouver,"As someone looking for housing, it's hilarious seeing this stuff. ""everything is private... Also, kitchen/bathroom/living room/all of them are shared"". That's... Not how that works."
boardgames,"Wouldn't that feel a bit on rails then? If there's only one ""right"" move?"
boardgames,"In regards to your optimal strategy point, would you say it's more 'if I go strategy A, the best move is to do XYZ' or is it kinda 'if I do strategy A, I can do moves 123 OR 456 OR 789' . Aka, is there a locked in best turn?"
Games,"I mean, you don't even do anything. You just press the button. At least the thousand fold arms is a cute Lil thing you do. That's just 'press X for cutscene'"
Games,"Agreed. It just felt weird. I liked the bosses so far but the other stuff, eh. Also, is it just me, or do you like, rarely use the elemental powers?"
Games,"A friend of mine said this which sums up how i feel (halfway through world 3/5); ""I beat Paper Mario Origami King. It was... hmmmm... I enjoyed it but I would have been fine not playing it."" 

It's a good game, its combat is... solid, its music is great, its world is gorgeous, its dialogue is fantastic and it all around has oodles of charm.. But it also doesnt live up to TTYDs charm imo (yeah yeah yeah TTYD is better, etc), its plot is 'paper thin', its combat can get tedious and is ridiculously samey, and the partners, well, what partners? Oh and customization is low to basically not even there. It's fine, but i wish Nintendo would give us a TTYD sequel. This just feels like a halfway point."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Oh of course. I meant if anyone posted supply explanations on here, not tagging this actual ""reddit post"" as spoilers.

Thats understandable. I guess it could help with certain decks, to make it ""harder"" or ""easier"" on yourself."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"As someone whos played through halfish of FA, and is not gonna check so please spoiler tag stuff... Why would you want to check what supplies you take? Wouldnt that be a bit too ""map out the game?"" Or is it more for people who've played through it a few times and wanna focus on the gameplay aspects more?"

boardgames,"[WTB] Too many Bones (anything but undertow) in Canada

careerguidance,"Honestly, I completely agree with this and strongly suggest OP follow the advice here, at least for why you were ""fired"". The job market is fucking tough. In an ideal world, your honestly would be appreciated and not negatively affect your chances. In reality, the minute you say you're fired, or something negative, im positive your chances of being hired will drop substantially. They don't need to know. Do whats best for you."
vancouver,"Option A. Studio/1 bedroom. The main thing iv'e run into problems with is really location. I'd like to be within 10 mins walk from expo line and its tough to find that, in addition to a place i'd like."
vancouver,Do you have any suggestions on groups to join?
vancouver,"Appreciated. Iv'e always had (well, in the two places ive moved into here) luck with craigslist ads. But now, with single bedroom, the options are slimmer so i think this'll help. Thank you."
vancouver,"For facebook marketplace, is there a way to filter them?"

socialskills,"Id like to say i tryu and be interested in other peoples experiences. Ask questions, finish thoughts (maybe this is an issue, hmm) show i AM listening and AM interested..."
socialskills,I think the second point is a big one. I try to be enthusiastic but i dont really know if i do the best job.
socialskills,"Why not just say I'm busy, in regards to let me get back to you??"
askgaybros,"Its not so much them ghosting me. If we havent met, yeah it hurts but we never met so i understand. It's the ""YEAH I WANNA HANGOUT"" then crickets, then ""yeah sorry ive been busy ok lets do next week"" and again crickets. Its just like, ghost me, or say no, but dont keep spooling me along. Its not rocket science."
askgaybros,"Yeah but isnt that shitty? To me, flaking on the first meetup, and neither one of you messaging each other, that just seems kinda crappy."
askgaybros,"Agreed, thats probably helpful. But i still dont get what to do with the second part. Guys i want not being into me, it is what it is, thats their decision and i have to suck it up... But not putting in the effort is something ive constantly been reminded of and i dont know what to do about it."
askgaybros,"Thank you for this. I think thats my issue, and describes me in a lot of ways. Not that exact example and decision, but in a lot of ways, i feel like that 18 year old guy (im 24 but still). I get all the messages and oh god im so hot, oh my, lets meet now. And it turns into being stood up or they dont wanna do anything after. Or, lord, fresh meat syndrome (new guy on the block, everyone says hi, youre the hot commodity) wears off. Its tough though, to not assume its me. Ive heard it happens to other guys, even the hottest men i can think of, but its tough to put that into actual thoughts."
askgaybros,"I completely agree but this isnt ""oh we hungout, fucked, and he wasnt interested after"". Its ""oh well weve hooked up, it was great, HE wants to do it again, but apparently is too busy/silent?"""
askgaybros,"And God forbid you confront him and ask about it. Hell throw the entire book of excuses at you. And if you come off as frustrated, hell get pissed off. Like, whew dude, excuse me for being upset you won't be honest."
askgaybros,"I think my issue isn't so much that I want that, but that guys lie about it. I'm perfectly fine being 'just a hole' to them, but if they outright say they wanna hangout as friends more, or go on a date, or whatever, then I expect them to follow through with that."
askgaybros,"Ahhh. Yeah. Thats frustrating. The 'I want more but all I'm going to actually do is sex.'wbich makes no sense. If you wanna date, let's go on a date. If you just wanna fuck, don't say you wanna date. And things change I get it, but you can't have it both ways."
askgaybros,"I mean I kinda get it in regards to dates, I want to fuck guys I don't wanna date... It's more the hidden motive of what they truly want. Them saying theyre intersted in a date with me, then never actually, ya know, plan for it despite me outright asking when they're free. It's these outright lies and it's frustrating that I have to either accept it, or call them out and have them throw a fit becsuse I didn't accept their wishy washy answer."
Games,"The simplest and, easy answer, is complexity. League is great but it's a lot easier to comprehend. Items aren't as nuts, and there's not as many things going in.

Dota has more going on. Heroes are, imo, more powerful and more nuts abilities, there's more going on (runes in the river, dewarding with wards vs red lens, invisibility can play a bigger part, now there's apparently shrines and map control) and items are a lot more powerful and varied."
askgaybros,"Do i do kegals while im being sucked/fucking, or is this just something to do overall?"
Games,"Is the game out yet? I thought it was gonna come out next month. Tbh, from what ive seen of the gameplay, it seems ""fine"" but youre in it for the style and music seemingly."
askgaybros,"It's more that i feel icky and bad, but within a bit of time, am ready to go after. Though i guess the solution is pushing past it."
askgaybros,My issue is cumming more then once. My refractory period can be nasty and put me out of it for a solid 15+ mins.
askgaybros,I have a tenga flip hole but It feels too good to stop usually. And clean up is a bit annoying.
Games,"The issue is also that TTYD has reasons for doing what it did. For example, battles. If all battles do is get you coins, and your equipment decays, then why bother fighting? Ill just save my best weapons and fight the boss, avoiding battles."
Games,"The issue is the, seemingly, lack of partners (they exist but dont seem to do much if they do), lack of experience (you get coins, maybe?) and ""sticker items"" (shiny hammer, dull hammer, and after you use them after X times, they get used up) instead of say FP from TTYD. Oh and lack of badges (they also seem to exist but in very light ""heres more hp"" ""heres a little more time to spin the wheel"" vs abilities like in TTYD)"
socialskills,"I really appreciate this and it resonates a lot with me. Id say my only comment is, can you elaborate more on the solution? Like, being yourself. Is it just speaking your mind or being maybe a bit more ""selfish"" and strict and not just having your entire schedule open? If that makes sense."

LifeAfterSchool,"I agree with snek a lot. It's just kinda a part of life. Iv'e struggled a lot with what youre feeling but i think at the end of the day, the best, and only, thing to do is to treasure the memories. Things will never be the same, but youll always have the memories. And theres so much more to see, meet, and do."
Games,"Honestly, I feel like stuff with the Raymond and 'I NEED THIS SPECIFIC ANIMAL' the turnip stocks, the island stuff for money, has made AC feel a little less wholesome. It's not the games fault, it's the players, but it feels, slightly, tainted in a way. A bit more 'I'm gonna game the system' vs 'I'm gonna plant a peach tree right here because I like peaches and that's all'."
boardgames,"Simple answer: everything is dictated by dice. Wanna go to spot A? Dice roll. Use an item? Dice roll. Go to location? Dice roll. I cant remember if there are ways to mitigate said dice, but if there are, there a few ways to do so."
askgaybros,Any advice on how to give a good rim job?
socialskills,I think my issue is getting to that point. I want to do all of that but even meeting people more than once can be tough.
sex,Sure but ive met and talked to plenty of guys who don't have problems with it/can just move right along. How do they do so?
askgaybros,"Theres sites selling premade ones? Really? And no, i like hookups, but sometimes a gloryhole has a hotness to it."
askgaybros,Nail some footers? How so?
socialskills,"Its not so much that, its that hanging out with new people can feel like pulling teeth sometimes. They just dont put in any effort. Its frustrating."
socialskills,So would you say you almost had a list of stuff to do for each friend that corresponded to interests you liked/wanted to explore more too?
socialskills,"I do try, but it feels like for a lot of people, theyre hesitant to be open with me so soon. It's tough to make connection and give them what they want when they dont."
sex,"Yeah iv'e heard of other people who deal with the same situation, and i understand its probably just a chemical thing... But im unsure of how to deal with it. Its frustrating that if i get off first, i have 0 desire to get the other guy off, despite wanting nothing less than to do that just a minute ago."
Games,"I see your point but i think it's enough of a gameplay mechanism, plus is talked about on even the games main page blurb, that its ok to mention."
Games,An open world exploration game with a timeloop. Open world but... compact is a good word. Its small but dense.
askgaybros,Ah ok. I guess for me it makes me feel weird when i cant/dont want to go for that long.
askgaybros,"I supoose for stamina it's more so just, fucking and not getting sore or cumming. How could someone fuck that long and not have their dick be sore, and have came or something?

Fair. Honestly, I want to try it. Its just foreign to me becsuee I've not done it."
askgaybros,"I dunno, maybe its just me, but that seems like a lot. Even if its easy to keep going, id struggle to, well, not cum. And sex is great and all, but for a solid hour of just fucking? I'd get bored."
askgaybros,"What kind of foreplay? I usually just kinda make out, suck him off, fuck him and im good... Which i suspect is not great."
Games,"It's not the cost thats the issue, its getting burned out and never actually beating it when it hits 1.0"
Games,Do they have an ETA on 1.0? I'd love to grab this but I wait to get it when it's offically out.
Games,"It is pretty weird, to me, that a game like this, which has its whole ideal being the real time aspect, is now turning into this weird... Market stock thing. But hey, at the end of the day, you can play it the market stock way, or the way Nintendo intended and either way works. It doesn't affect me by playing one way or another and shouldn't affect anyone else. It's just fascinating seeing it happen."
Games,"I was so excited for this, but nervous about the combat and experience...

Unfortunately this locks down my decision to completely pass on it. Nintendo STILL hasnt learned what we want (actual experience, points to, ya know, fighting stuff)."
Fitness,"So basically, its ok to use the beginner routine on the wiki, even if its ""easier"", and then, eventually, i can do the standard version and so on?"
Fitness,"Has anyone struggled with even ""beginner"" routines? Even the ones on the wiki iv'e struggled with. Is it just a matter of starting even smaller (if it says do it 10 times, do it 5, etc?)? And if so, how can i do it if say the bar for a bench press is too heavy or i cant do a situp/pushup/pull up?"
Fitness,"I'm unsure what routine to do. Iv'e tried the beginner (on the wiki) and general ""beginner"" routines but i just, well, cant do them. The bar, for bench presses, is too heavy for example, chinups, even ""easy"" ones i struggle with. In addition, i struggle with ensuring my form is right. I did have a personal trainer but since corona hit, ive not been able to use him past one session. Any advice on what to do? I want to do something but even the ""beginner"" routines feel way above me."
Fitness,"Unsure where to ask this so im asking in moronic monday and here just in case.

boardgames,"You hit the nail on the head with the gameplay flaw of resetting. I can compare it to a roguelike: I die, i reset and know more about the world, enemies, and challenges. In theory, it means i can go through the game faster and encounter new challenges, quickly bypassing the stuff iv'e done. In execution, for 7th continent, i still have to go ""ok im at point X, i need to find item 1, ok now im at point Y, i need to find item 2"". And its... Fine, but the puzzle of that, and the randomness of the encounters (oops, the bees hurt me because i didnt have a *insert bee repellent*) are frustrating. I love their idea, and i can see what they WANT 7th continent to be, but my god it just fell flat for me and i hate that."
boardgames,"Wasnt massive darkness a HUMONGOUS flop? I saw ""all of it"" being listed for big bucks and few of it selling."
jobs,Where should I post instead?
askgaybros,"This in particular. Ill message god knows how many guys, they hem and haw over meeting, i just end up cumming. Not even 10 minutes later, they ALL seem to respond and it makes me very sad."
Games,"That makes sense, I mean, there's not much indication that it has been. But... We haven't heard a prep about it. All we know is that little  15 second teaser of Bayonetta fighting something, not even in game. And something about it being 'different' (more open?). It was announced over a year ago with nothing else. It's a bit weird for them to announce it and then not say anything else. My guess, and hope, is it'll be a big blow out event during e3... Sorry, during whatever thing nintendo may or may not do for what should've been e3"
arkhamhorrorlcg,What about canada?
sex,"From what iv'e read, there's not a ton on it other then ""it happens, just kinda accept it""."
Games,"Advertising. Kickstarter is really good about advertising your game. Boardgame companies do this all the time. Why make it yourself when you can have people not only pay in advance, possibly a lot of money, but they'll talk to their friends, post about it on reddit, engage with it in the Kickstarter, have updates etc et"
princealbertpiercings,"Just to clarify, a month AFTER the infection has been dealt with? Iv'e had the piercing since mid January to be clear."
princealbertpiercings,"Sorry, yeah. How long until I don't have to use a condom though?"
boardgames,"The one shots are not easy and guardians is said to be two of the hardest scenarios in the game. With just two core sets, you're gonna be struggling a lot."
boardgames,"Agree on a lot but not all of it. 

Their thoughts on core, completely agree, though core cards are still very useful.

Dunwich... I mean, it's great but it's not amazing. It's solidly good imo. I'd gladly play it but i think i prefer the other campaigns so far.

Carcosa, hard? It's not easy but idk if i'd particularly call it that hard. It's challenging imo. Now TCU and TFA are hard imo. But iv'e enjoyed both. Also, tbh, idk if i love their whole ""whats the best cycle"" because eventually, you'll be getting all of it.

Oh, also, for carcosa, yeah theres two paths. being annoyed about one being locked off just is... Weird. If it was just experiencing it all, it would be a bit boring in some ways, like dunwich (can) be."
Games,"Oh yeah, I don't mean it's the exact same situation. It just seems to me that iv'e heard multiple, different, glitches making people lose items. This is just yet another one."
Games,"Haven't there been, if im correct, multiple times this has happened? Not this exact scenario, but people losing god knows what items and resources multiple times due to ""glitches""? I mean good lord Bethesda, FO76 isnt even that old."
vancouver,"Is your app showing them? Mine just shows all of them as ""grey""."
vancouver,Weird. Yeah i may just redownload it. It shows EVERY store as grey for some reason.
askgaybros,Is there? I don't know honestly.
askgaybros,"Yeah that's my thing, I can later that day, but the amount of cum i have is... minimal. It's always bothered me."
Games,"??? What is this? All its saying is that this ""ValueAct"" is investing in Nintendo."
boardgames,"It's OOP.

it's co-op and theres a zillion co-ops out there now so competition is tough.

Its got a traitor and those are hit or miss."
boardgames,"You could buy from the secondary market. It wont be cheap, but depends on the game."
boardgames,A lot of these ideas have been thrown around. The issue i think really comes down to getting people to use it.
askgaybros,"Are you following the two rules? (also, luck plays a role in it)."
princealbertpiercings,"It's hard to tell because that entire part of my body is, generally, warm."
princealbertpiercings,"Will do. The most i'd do is go to a doctor. That's my main concern. Iv'e been lax on the sea salt stuff, so i'll be upping those again. Iv'e not noticed any pus, just the ""white stuff"" which is in the hole itself, and seems fine (?) no bleeding, but a weird smell and some redness above the hole."
princealbertpiercings,"Wouldn't they, potentially, recommend a doctor if it was infected?"
princealbertpiercings,I can't because of Corona. No ones open.
askgaybros,"I haven't lately, but yeah, even in the past. I cum and i feel revolted by being around them for a bit."
askgaybros,"I haven't. Looking into them, it seems the best/only solution is therapy though?"
askgaybros,"It's more emotional guilt/shame I suppose. It takes some time for me to be back to ""able to get horny/not want to run away screaming from my hookup/close fuck buddy/FWB""."
askgaybros,I wouldn't be surprised. Been trying to talk to a therapist but unable to money wise right now.
askgaybros,"I guess it's a combination of horniness dropping to negative and being 'disgusted' at what I'm doing. If I'm using a dildo, I want it OUT. if I'm inside a guy, Im getting dressed and leaving. Even if it's a guy I care about,i feel this way."
askgaybros,Really? I thought a lot of/most guys did. May just be some of us.
boardgames,"I dunno about that. I'd argue they just fill different niches. Star realms is pretty fast, ascension is slower but not as in your face about things like star realms, or hero realms, can be."
vancouver,"Seems they don't have delivery available, or at least not close to me :( but great suggestion."
princealbertpiercings,"Thanks, will do. How much salt should I put into each cup though?"
princealbertpiercings,"Ah ok. I'll have to ask when I go in if it's too thin. Yeah, I may be having sex and or masturbatig too quickly. I haven't done the saline soaks since my piercer said I didn't need to and from what I saw the soaks were pretty expensive. Is there any you'd recommend? Also, if it helps, I suspect I may have a UTI due to symptoms that match and a weird smell, but it could also be infection so I have no idea."
princealbertpiercings,"Glad to hear it, thanks."
askgaybros,"Ah ok. So for that one, you pour it into some water and chug it twice a day? And it works fine?"
askgaybros,"Yeah I don't love how much sugar is in the orange juice, especially how much I have to chug, but is water ok? The taste seems disgusting and I'm afraid it would be tough to get down. Have a hard time with pills too or I'd just go with them."
princealbertpiercings,We're you able to have sex with it before the 6 months were over?
askgaybros,"It really depends for me. I don't care about 'fancy preseents' and 'going to bars all the time'... But, i do care if they can get around (ex: if i live in a place where a car is required and he doesn't have one and needs rides) or, if he works so much that i dont get to spend enough time with him. Like naything in life, its a bit grey."
arkhamhorrorlcg,You should have 3 turns to do so due to his special thing.
boardgames,"I'm fine with them making it more robust and demanding, but yeah, as is, it just feels annoying and tedious. ""oh i need to get food"". Ok, iv'e milled through the deck using memory, gotten a weapon. Ok, time to go forward. Oh, i need a rope. Time to do the same thing. It's got somethig there, but it needs more."
boardgames,"Just a quick note in general. When a game goes out of stock, it can be back quickly, a few weeks or months... Or longer (years). Not saying to buy a game now or never, but keep in mind it may be a month or more before it's back in stock and getting it will take scrounging around online stores (Amazon, coolstuff Inc, miniature market, etc) or local game stores."
boardgames,"Ah ok. I never got super far into it, so I wouldn't neccesarily know but I get the idea. Oh yeah, something like mage knight would be amazing. I love 7th continent in theory, it just needs to have a more compelling puzzle. I've not heard much on the gameplay of citadel but I think, and hope, they can fix my issues with continent. I can see the bones of a great system. They just need to have more there, and have more to learn to get better at the game."
boardgames,"Yes and no. From what I've played, maybe 5 hours of voracious goddess, yes the exploration deck is different (usually) but the items deck isn't. It feels limited and the puzzle is just not good enough, imo. I wish it had more variety. I liked the puzzle, I liked what it was doing but man oh man it could've been better (also, the card sorting got tedious really fast)"
piercing,"Will do, thanks."
piercing,"I'm honestly unsure. The piercer, i learned later, wasn't the best. I suspect 8 gauge on size though."
piercing,"It can be painful/annoying, but it's never been as bad, or anywhere near as much, as when I first got it. The skin around the lower hole is kinda a weird color, It's almost prune like, but I don't know if that's a sign of an issue or if it's something entirely different."
Games,"I was so excited for this... And then it hit and reviews just were not good. Super disapointing. I'd love to grab it, but it seems all the criticisms, especially ones in this thread, are still valid."
askgaybros,"I would too. But at the end of the day, I don't blame you and you owe no one your time."
askgaybros,"Well, no. Unlike everyone here, I disagree. Is it a bit rude? Sure. But you either subscribe to the 'every guy deserves a response' which can be overwhelming and cause issues, or you block them if not interested."
Games,"It will for 1.0. The ""final stage""."
arkhamhorrorlcg,I'm in a similar situation and considering it. Anyone else have any input on it?
vancouver,"Sorry, I should've been clearer. I am staying at home, but i'd like to do delivery."
Games,"It's not the exact same, but it's a bit similar in the idea of constantly moving and doing attacks for Eden. For what its worth, i love necrodancer and i havent gotten past the second world. Its tough. But very good."
Games,"From what I've played, yes and no. It seems to be, from reading steam reviews and comments here, a big mix of them. The analogy I think may be apt is crypt of the necrodancer; you have to always be thinking a few steps ahead on spells, mana, cards (for eden) and for crypt, health, beat, coins, and weapons overall. I hope that helps."
Games,"It almost reminds me of crypt of the necrodancer in some ways, with its planning a few steps ahead and constantly moving."
Games,"I just bought it for curiosities sake and played a run on my switch. Wow, there is a lot going on. Iv'e never played much of Megaman battle network so i have no strong feelings on the 'genre' but it's very cool. A mix of slay the spire deck building/map, along with (googling some videos) MMBN gameplay (possibly more fast paced, those bosses hit HARD and fast) with a bunch of unlockable characters (i think i counted 7) costumes AND a few different load outs. Pretty tough but quite cool."
vancouver,"So, if i'm fired from my job, this would not work for me, correct? Likewise, if I quit."
jobs,"The main thing is, should I even bother? No one's hiring right now and I'm not even supposed to leave my house."
college,"Not the exact same, but kinda similar. I graduated about a year and change ago so take this with a grain of salt but... I get where you're coming from OP. I did clubs, i met friends, i did a lot. But, even then, i spent a lot of it holed up in my room alone, or regretting not doing things.

My advice? I guess, as hard as it may be, be happy for the experiences you have. If you look back at it and keep regretting it, you'll go crazy (iv'e gone slightly crazy). At the end of the day, college is just another part of your life, for better or worse. I think the main lesson learned is live your life fuller. You realize now how yes academics is important but a social life, parties (if youre into them) boyfriend/girlfriends, friends, just hanging out with friends are SO important and what you'll remember when you look back. Dont neglect work or studies, but if anything, put relationships first imo. Also, i saw someone mention doing a ""victory lap"" of an extra semester. Financially, it may be tough, and idk if i can recommend it. But, if you have the funds/are ok with it, i'd say go for it. You do only have these things (college) once. Once it's over, that book is shut.

TLDR: don't waste it, live your life fully, focus on work and studies but make (imo) a bigger focus on relationships and memories."
piercing,"Good to know. It's mostly just sore. Some piercing pain but more sore if I mess with it much. But ty, I'll consider it."
piercing,"Good to know. Though for right now, I don't think I can take it out until it's healed, can I? And my main concern is if I can use it. Can I even touch it? Have sex, safe or not? When can I if not?"
piercing,I don't.
piercing,A u shape. 8 gauge I think. I don't.
boardgames,"It's messy, it's heavy, it's long, it's got a ton of interaction for better or worse (I think mostly better) and it's best with 4-5. I think it's great but I acknowledge it's flaws. I actually played it for the first time with the meeple mentor and, for me at least, it went fine. A lot? Yes. Did I forget to do things? You betcha. Do I think it deserves to be praised even with its flaws? Also yes."
Games,"Wait, really? I swear it was last month... Huh."
Games,"Didn't Anodyne two come out like, a month ago? Same with Mutaizone. I'm not against it, just feels a little weird to have them free so fast"
arkhamhorrorlcg,There's three paths? I thought there was only two.
boardgames,"In regards to buying arkham, you can possibly pick up someones collection for cheaper, but it depends on where you look.

Buying it besides that... You really just have to bite the bullet and buy it all. It'll suck, and trust me my wallet hates me, but no other game matches what arkham does with its theme and mechanics. 

Also, you really shouldn't just buy the deluxe expansion. With arkham, past core, you should (and i cant think of anyone who doesnt) play it in campaign mode. So, deluxe (first two scenarios) then 6 mythos packs (scenarios 3-8)."
Games,"My main question is, is Ori a good game, or a good metroidvania? Because the original Ori is a great game but a garbage metroidvania. Idk if that was just games journalists calling it that or what though."

It seems that, for me, it'll be ok as long as it only happens very sparingly according to what you're saying. My main concern is, honestly, getting to the interview part. I can easily explain it away, but if ATS catches it instantly, i'm more concerned."

And, once i get an RRSP (retirement fund basically) it'll still be ok. If I get a TFSA (no idea what it is tbh) itll get a bit more complicated. And if i invest money somewhere, it'll be a bit more complicated too (which i currently dont have)."

boardgames,"I feel the exact same but its getting a ton of positive buzz for how ""good the theme is"". Which is fine, but at the end of the day, gameplay/mechanics trump all. My favorite game of all time is the arkham horror card game and the only reason it is, is because it has both in spades. If it had JUST solid theme but dice rolling for everything else, it would be nowhere near my top. Nemesis deserves praise yes, but only for its theme and art, not for its gameplay."

boardgames,"I'm kinda crap as well but honestly, you just have to play them and play them a lot. A lot of mechanics like resource management and risk assessment (will player A get resource 1 before me) is something that comes with time. As long as you're having fun, thats what matters and what makes me, personally, ok with losing even if it's annoying."
boardgames,"I played it at shux with one of the SVWAG guys. He actually proceeded to bash it at the podcast which was fun.

It just feels... Weird. It's a bit euroey, where you're choosing actions and upgrading things and it's got some nameless army youre fighting and then you go fight (maybe, but only if someone picked fight as an action) and you get vp and yay? It felt like they threw a bunch of mechanics on, slapped a generic theme, and called it a day. It was ""fine""/boring."
boardgames,"Disagree on that note. There's multiple resolutions to scenarios, branching paths, different scenarios and investigators to play as, return to boxes..."

arkhamhorrorlcg,"Minh isn't great for dunwich imo, due to a really nasty encounter card that negates her card draw stuff."

college,"It's tough, it really is, but it'll be worth it. I'd recommend toastmasters if your school has it, for public speaking, a club or organization for your degree, or something close to it, and somr sort of leadership stuff. Lots of outgoing people join those and they can lift you up, and get connections."
college,"Communicate with your roommate. I'll repeat it: communicate with your roommate (or roommates) they're too loud in the morning? Have soaking wet towels in the bathroom? Whatever it is, communicate. And if it breaks down, if they're nasty or have an attitude and you've tried your best, go to an RA. They are there to help even if they sometimes just act like another dorm student. Room changes aren't easy, but if they're needed they're possible.

And general transfer tip as a whole: get involved. Being a transfer student is tough. The colllege assumes you already know everything but if it's say community colllege, you may know classes but not how to meet people. Join clubs, hangout with people, try to make it all last becsuse it's grsat and once it's done it's done"

boardgames,"Have you tried 1303 and if so, do you have any thoughts on it?"
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Have you added the exp for the standalone exp stuff? I don't think I did for my first scenario and got obliterated, but id consider it ""stand alone"" and with it, exp rules applying."
boardgames,"Completely fair. In that case, I understand.

Eh, it's kinda a thing we just deal with. Rumor has it FFG didnt even mean to have the marvel cardgame just have one core, someone accidently put 1-4 players on it and they had to stick with it. But it is extremely frustrating even if i bought it."
boardgames,"It's great it worked for you, but the majority of people who play, play campaign. I'd recommend core as a one or maybe two player time for the core campaign, but you at least need a full cycle to start making decent decks, and two cores are pretty important for some stuff like extra emergency caches. But, one core is great for dipping your toe in to decide on if you wanna dive in or not."
boardgames,"I love these lists. It's always fun seeing peoples top 5, 10, 100, etc, and more importantly, WHY they like it so much."
boardgames,"I can completely understand why people hate Feudum. It's long, messy and best at 5. But, even with a 4+ hour game, including teaching, I really enjoyed it. It has a lot of moving parts but it all comes back to the guild system and the level of interactivity with it, in addition to general play, is fantastic. Yes its messy long and could've used a chunk of it taken out, but it's unique in a time where I feel like we're getting a bit too ""its like X mechanic, but with a small twist""."
college,"In my experience, not so much this stuff but social experiences, people can be really fucking weird about going to a higher authority rather than talking to you about it. The toilet thing shouldn't be hard, ""hey im in here, pls turn on the lights"". Ok no problem. In execution, it turns into a ""hey Chapstick was a horrible person and turned off the lights and im upset"" which is absurd. But, people are weird."

boardgames,"There is WAY too little Argent: The consortium on this list. 

**Argent: The consortium** is a worker placement. It's gorgeous and has you all as chancellors at a wizardy school trying to become the next big arch chancellor. You do this by having the most of specific resources based on secret voters. You start out knowing one, and can find out more, but you'll probably never know all of them.



The twist on the worker placement is twofold: First, you DONT get the resources until after the round is over. And second, you're all wizards and have a lot of sneaky wizard stuff to do. You can blow up a room, sending all wizards there to the infirmary. You can lock it down, making no one else enter/leave. You can sit on the side lines, making it so no one can touch you. You can boot people off spots but ""not"" kill them. All the while you have to be watching what people are hoarding. ""hey paul has 20 gold, i wonder if he knows a win condition"". It's long, it's a pain to set up but theres nothing else like it."
boardgames,"Question: How does the federalist win? It sounds pretty simple to avoid. If the game is X points from everyone losing (i think it's 25 for federalist, so lets say there's 3 points until end of game), wouldn't people say ""oh hey guys, it's 3 points away, we cant let this happen so lets avoid it""?"
boardgames,"Way too vague of a question buddy, and belongs in the rec thread."
boardgames,"You have to first buy the core. It's the rules, a small 3 scenario campaign, and pieces like health and clues. 

After, you pick a cycle. You ""should"" go chronologically but it's not explcitly required. You buy the deluxe box to start, which includes 5 new investigators (one for each class, excluding carcosa which has a special one) and the first two scenarios in the campaign. You ""could"" play them all individually but the best (basically only) way to play is a campaign. You then buy, after a deluxe box, 6 ""mythos"" packs, all containing a scenario+player cards to slot into your deck. Once you have deluxe+6 mythos packs, you can play through the 8 scenario campaign for whatever it may be."
boardgames,"I'm not sure if you've played 7th continent, but it sounds like it's like that. Yes the story/mystery/puzzles are great but that's the reward for being good at the FIRST half, the resource management (in 7th conitnents case, the deck manipulation)."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I mean, if you want to play dunwich at all, you can't just skip a scenario. You could, but thats not the best way to play it. You'll have to play through it if you wanna play through the campaign. And considering how OOP it is, id say go for it."

Me saying I wanted a better opportunity and not saying I was fired is what I'd say. Saying I was fired is a sure way to get your chances of getting hired go from positive, to 0%."
jobs,"Take what I say with a grain of salt, I'm newish to the job world but lol at some of these comments. Be honest about being fired? Don't put it on your resume? Fuck that. Lie. 'I decided the company didn't have enough upward momentum and wanted to find a place to grow and learn'. Something fluffy and nice. Saying something like 'yeah I got fired for breaking company policy on accident' or even just 'yeah I got fired' in any respect is a horrible idea. What's important is youre notc a bad employee. And you shouldn't get punished for a bullshit policy. No employer will care you got fired for something like that unless you tell them."
Games,"Maybe I'm the outlier but the hex did not live up to the hype. It was a nice twist at the end, but getting there it was way too vague and the gameplay was, honestly, kinda boring. Undertale succeeded, imo, because it had good gameplay. The combat, dodging different enemies and rpg elements, was always unique with good quirky humor. The hex did not have that."

Yet i always am pulled into a game despite being shit at it because ""we need one more player, spader pls"". And then i suck.

Captain Sonar: Now it's a great game, its cool etc but every time ive played it or seen people play it (played once, seen twice) it ends in arguments of ""well you cheated because you didnt announce X"" ""but i wasnt supposed to and our *insert officer* was supposed to"". It's dumb."

arkhamhorrorlcg,Ah ok. Iv'e ran through only half of carcosa so ive not realized that.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I suppose the ""unfair advantage"" is the idea of ""i know exactly what i have, i have lucky, i have magnifying glass"" as opposed to saying, because of rules, ""i can survive a bad chaos bag draw and have some extra lore"" for vagueness."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"My issue honestly is that i cant seem to get a consistent campaign game for it. Spirit Island I like a lot, but i can easily get a game if i need to and then its done. Arkham has the campaign aspect and i want to play continously because thats how its supposed to be. 

Why 2 vs 3?"
boardgames,"My issue is, honestly, and this may be a 'damn youth' thing but i wanna play once a week. Or, at least consistently. I don't want to somtimes play thursday at 6, and hopefully get through a scenario and then two weeks go by and then we play saturday at 3 for two scenarios but just barely and then we play monday at 4 but get through half of one. It's too much for how long the games are."
boardgames,"Oh yeah, i'm aware. I love the LCG, but idk if i'd want to do it solo, especially since some mechanics rely on the multiplayer stuff (EX: in carcosa, some cards are hidden so your teammates dont know you have XYZ)."
boardgames,Surprised arkham is solo vs multiplayer. I love arkham but i'm unsure if id want to do solo tbh.
boardgames,I'm shocked no one's mentioned the actual game that's been said to be a better monopoly: lords of Vegas. It still has dice and property but it's far less 'roll the dice get fucked for landing on spot A over B' and has a focus on area control and heavy player interaction.

I'm reading up comments on COTD for Devils Luck (which im like, 90% slotting into my minh deck) and all of the comments say ""oh yeah its not worth it unless youre dealing with A. ""blah blah blah"" B. ""blah blah blah"" or C. Beyond the veil as minh... Seems I should've slotted this in earlier. Iv'e also solved my problem, i suspect. I'm gonna slot in devils luck, to negate beyond the veil. I'm gonna slot in two ""ive got a hunch"" for fast clue generation, and something to do with my overabundance of resources, and i'm gonna slot in one ""in the know"" so i can investigate from a distance. Thanks guys."
piercing,"On a side note, the piercing still hurts. Not all the time but sometimes it's very annoying. Maybe medium pain. Idk if it's concerning if I only got it last Saturday, like 8 days ago."

arkhamhorrorlcg,"I don't think I own it, but the main issue is I have lucky and look what I found for 4/5 of my survivor cards I can have. My last one is cherished keepsake but I'm gonna replace it."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I'm thinking of going for them. The issue is, if I get beyond the veil, half of my strategy seems gone. So I yhink having just one of them would be fine. I have two books of lore so I can, probably, mill through my deck and find them if needed."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I have two forewarned, which are nice for avoiding treacheries. The issue with the last time I used it though was, beyond the veil, the card that eventually would've killed me, had surge on it. And the rules say it ONLY negates revelation. And it turned out that the next card was another beyond the veil..."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Really? It caused some issues last scenario and the third scenario, miskatonic, outright killed me. Yeah, I mean, i can handle myself if I need to in terms of avoiding combat, even if I can't fight myself, it's just annoying when I cant do 2 clues a turn or something."
Games,Pathologic 2 is said to be a stunning example of this. It's brutal and weird and kinda clunky but I've heard nothing but praise for its moral choices.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Ah ok. Yeah, for whatever reason, dumb luck or otherwise, I'm the one who gets stuck with beyond the veil. Unfortunately this also means that me, a seeker, who wants to mill through their deck fast, loses faster. I'm probably going to slot in one of those 3 cards for the next scenario. I still think I could be a bit faster, and my partner needs more clue generation (for example, last scenario was literally just skill tests and one reoccurring monster) but the main issue so far has, honestly, been that stupid card."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I may need to go for those. An issue can definintely be movement.

It's me and the zealot lady. I forgot her name but she's the guardian with a knife. Minus is the physical one, where I need to spend 2 actions or else I take a damage each turn. Not a ton. I used to, but now I have hiding spot that I've been using to avoid getting smacked. The issue in particular so far seems to be that I run through my deck too fast and trigger the treachery that kills me for it."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Not sure, I've never heard of it."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Just two. But the other investigator has maybe one clue card, drawn to the flame, and that's about it."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The issue has been, so far, i get those ""if you draw through your deck, you lose"" so i'm wary of card draws."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The issue isnt lore books. I ""could"" use more, but i'm ok on it. The issue is i can only generate 1 clue per, most, actions. Archaic Glyphs ive not seen much on, fingerprint kit i dont have circle undone.

Whats shovel do? 

I have both of those two red cards: LWIF and Lucky, but unfortunantely, both LWIF were at the BOTTOM of my entire deck :( and i had the hex so i died. 

Ty for the help, ill look into Archaic glyphs. I think another issue though is, tbh, ive just gotten nasty nasty card draws in Dunwich, combined with nasty treachery cards."

jobs,"That's the thing. I've heard a lot of people say I need IT experience, and others say I can be ok with customer service to start."
jobs,"It's a little hard to explain but it's a mix of customer service, finance and data entry.

It's stressful at times with stuff having to be edited and sent out fast, and more importantly, it's a very very narrow field. The skills could transfer to other stuff, but I never wanted to be in this job tbh.

The work itself? Eh. It's not hard?"
jobs,"Not much if any tbh. I'm hoping that my years of customer service experience will help get me into an entry level role where I can work my way up from there, getting ceritifcations and such."
boardgames,"My main issue with co-op games, and one that's only rarely solved, is quarterbacking. The two co-op games that I know that avoid it are Spirit island, due to the complexity of spirits and too much going on as well as your own powers and such

And, the arkham horror card game due to not being able to say what your cards are, and not knowing other characters as well as your own."
Games,"I'm concerned this won't fund, but i'm excited for it. It looks very good and has that subtle cosmic horror tint to it."
boardgames,As someone who loves agricola... Is Agricola: ACB&S good?
boardgames,"Would you say someone wanting to get Age of Steam should go for the base original, or deluxe?"
boardgames,"Bargain Quest also surprised me in how ok to meh it was. All i'd heard was positivity from SUSD and reviewers but playing it? It's bland, boring and really simple. It just felt like there was few decisions and a focus on a right one."
Games,"I liked death stranding a lot, it's solidly in my top 5 but GOTY? For so many people? Really? That just seems pretty weird."
boardgames,That's adorable and i may go for it wheni get some more TMB stuff.
boardgames,"Do you think it would work as well in a ""hey, i'm loooking to play pret a porter, high society and the estates, in that order (depending on time), whos interested? We need 4 max, first come first serve"")"
vancouver,"Sorry, I should've clarified, i can take the skytrain alllll the way in."
vancouver,So... Should I expect to go to work tomorrow if i work downtown in the morning?
boardgames,"Science is interesting in that its a little similar to war: you dont neccesarily need to get enough to win, just enough to make your opponent pick the science card, which may not help vs another such as war or points which may still work for you."
IWantOut,"As someone not currently in, but want to be in IT and eventually move to germany, do you have any advice on how to start? It's gonna be at least a few years of course, but i'd like to see about getting into the IT industry first and going from there."
malehairadvice,"Sounds good. The sides are something iv'e always thought about changing. It grows back damn fast too. I'll probably go for that, thanks."
boardgames,"Idk if that's a bad trade tbh. It's not amazing, but it's not pure garbage. Chinatown is still weirdly in/out of print for 50 ish dollars, T+E is about 30. It's not a good trade but i could've seen it plausible if you really wanted both."
malehairadvice,That's kinda what i do currently. I mostly slick it back and up. So it's like a _) design? I'd have to find a pic of it somewhere.
Games,This has been announced for months now hasnt it?
malehairadvice,"Yeah for sure. The only major concern is that it can be hard to replicate. Usually i like to uh ""slick it back"". Having that point at the end, somehow i sometimes cant replicate it."
malehairadvice,"https://imgur.com/a/7RNAq0T

Ignoring the atrocious picture, this is how I usually style it when I cut it. Should I continue as is, slicked back and kinda upward, or switch it up?"
boardgames,"This is a really interesting one. It seems like it'll work really well. You have to avoid the cops, grab the cash, get gear to help you navigate the streets... But it ends up jusy feeling way too complex for how simple it ends up being. And it's also completely turned me off to his games after playing it and vinhos. They just feel like complexity for complexitys sake with no point to all of that. I'd rather play other heavy games rather than his."
boardgames,"It was... Fine. It reminded me a lot of lacerda games, which isn't a good thing for me. I love heavy economic games but for whatever reason, both lacerdas iv'e tried (Vinhos and Escape plan) have been ok and not good for me. I can't put my finger on what exactly it is, but for whatever reason, they don't gel with me. Pipeline is basically a lacerda game and because of that, i think it's solidly ok and that's it."
Games,"Strongly disagree. Hollow knight has like, 16 distinct areas. Sundered is a rogue like and because of that you must run through the same randomly generated areas a lot and honestly they're not the best."
Games,"I strongly disagree. Sundered has some cool ideas such as the horde idea but it has some issues with just having to run through the same, kinda samey, areas. Its pretty flawed though I liked it, didn't love it."
discordapp,"It's a possibility, it mostly happens at my work computer, but why would it have only started as of a couple weeks ago, versus happening day one."
Games,What's the new patch add?
Games,"Outer Wilds taught me that I need to live in the moment, because you never know when your life will end."
boardgames,"There's one, mace, but it's not great. It's more rpg and tabletop focused. There's SOME boardgames but not a ton."
Games,"I mean, it took MONTHS for it to come to pc. If I wanted RDR2, and I mean really wanted it, I'd buy it on console because I wanna play it now. Yes, i may have a beefy pc and it'll look and play better but at the end of the day, personally at least, I just wanna play it. And I'm sure a lot of others are the same. Delaying the pc release for months is not a good idea."
bapccanada,"I don't but i'm considering those as seperate. For this, i'm considering the cost as just the PC itself, excluding monitor, keyboard, etc."
college,"I mean, you can always email and ask. Whether they'll let you or not, well, who knows."
askgaybros,"Fair. It's an issue I suppose. I'm worried i'm bad at it, so i don't do it, and dont get better and worry im bad. But i need tojust, well, do it."
askgaybros,"It's not even so much that people AREN'T into me. It's the concern that people are. Or, that i won't be good at sex. Or something."
Games,"NieR Automata
Pyre/transistor
FF14 (shadowbringers is amazing)
Persona 5.

Theres more but im blanking on them. There's so many good ones."
Games,"Somehow, Death Stranding is one of the only open world games i, personally, like and I think that's a big part of it. It's not ""heres a billion things to do"", the content IS the world itself. In addition, the social aspects make the world feel far more lived in then something like *insert random open world*"
Games,"Agreed completely. So many companies are boasting of how their world is ""bigger than planet earth"" or something crazy. The issue is, that's not a positive because they typically shove a lot of fetch quest and minor meh quests and activites into said world. I'd prefer a smaller, more detailed world (outer wilds does this tremendously) that's got more meaningful content."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Is the 19 or 29 exp dependent on scenario, or deck they make?"
boardgames,"This sounds really good with three questions.

A. iv'e not heard much on the Kickstarter. How... bad was it/what happened?

B. Is it coming to retail?

And C. My main concern with these games is binding agreemenets. Especially near the end of the game, if john and daniel agree john will help daniel, and theres just one more round, and john is a dick, john doesnt get ""that"" much negativity for himself. I like siderelal confleunce because ALL deals are binding or you lose a good bit of VP. I also think john company sorta does this too."
boardgames,"From what iv'e played (2-3 times of VCK, 1-2 of space base) space base is tighter and a bit more euroeyer, while VCK is a bit more loose and ameristyley. I think both are really good and i'd recommend both."
askgaybros,That helps a lot. Idk about the shorter hair thing but the rest of it is definintely helpful. Thank you. This is what I needed to hear
askgaybros,"At the end of the day, it's a risk you take. You can ask for his status, and judge him based on how he's acting, and of course if he comes off as a slut (not a negative just a fact) or not... But at the end of the day, he may give you one he may not. You just have to accept that risk or not do it."
askgaybros,"Good question. Im not sure. I mean, I have a picture that's a bit blurry that shows me with a shirt on, but I don't put that I'm fit or toned or whatever, I put that I'm average in my profile."
askgaybros,"Any ideas on how? Like, I'm not sure where, and lighting and such."
askgaybros,How do you find a gym buddy? I've looked all over and seemed to not find anyone.
askgaybros,So it's not a good picture? I've wondered that tbh.
askgaybros,"That's the thing. I go to bathhouses and easily get dick from some hot dudes. On grindr though, it can be a different story."
askgaybros,"I think it's a mix of expecting to meet the hottest hot guys but not having the body to match it. I'm not happy with it, but I'm working on going to the gym soon, once my life gets less messy"
askgaybros,"https://m.imgur.com/a/FNqWTI5

For anyone interested in my picture. This is what I've been using for body."
boardgames,"I mean, at the end of the day luck plays a part in it, but you can commit cards, have cards that ""guarantee"" the action will succeed, or have cards that, on failure, they actually succeed."
Games,"My concern is, there's been literally not a peep on this game. I'm happy there's a preview, sure, but it should have at least a few reviews, right?"
boardgames,"Utterly fantastic. But, also a huge money sink. You do only need 2, not 4, cores, but it's still gonna be a lot of money for each campaign. But my god, it's got such a superb mix of themey cthulhu tentacles, while having some of the best arkham files mechanics with the chaos bag push your luck aspect but also having a TON of ways to mitigate said luck. Every card feels meaningful, rather then just ""+1 whenever i shoot my gun, that i can use as much as i'd like"" like eldritch horror and co seem to be at times."
diabetes,"In that case, is there a way to prevent it, or know it ""will"" turn into type 2/1, or is it just ""it's gonna happen, regardless, so talk to doctor soon""."
diabetes,"That's concerning but not surprising. Iv'e had pee problems for a while now. It kinda comes and goes. So idk. But ive got some other concerns ill probably lump into one big ""visit""."
boardgames,"I'd actually assume you do need the base game. There's ""some"" canine specific cards, like the monocole, and the investigators overall, but theres too many cards you'd need for a decent deck, and this scenario pack only has 78 total."
boardgames,I wish I could grab that but it's oop and expensive as hell even for a solotter.
boardgames,"If I'm looking to get into cube rails, which should I get? Of the two, chichago express and Irish gsuge"
Games,"While I don't think the BT's are ""as much"" horror after you learn to deal with them, they still pose a fun little horror tense threat throughout the game (up until where I am, halfway ish through). I can see him expanding upon that tenseness a lot for horror aspects. I'm excited for whatever it ends up being."
Games,"Yeah, I mean, the other two don't seem bad or anything. I'm sure they're great games. Just, nothings really made me want to play them. But lovecraftian horror, time travel, and murders at a secluded manor? Hell yeah."
Games,"That... Sounds kinda amazing. And despite not playing to the moon 1 or 2,i really wanna play this one."
boardgames,"Comissioned is good.

Pillars of the Earth is also good.

Besides that, dunno. There's not a ""ton""."
Games,"I dunno about the future, but it is a type of open world exploration game I hope gets focused on more in the future. You don't ""gain"" anything physical. No level ups, no skill points, no items. You just gain knowledge. ""oh, if i go here at X time, and press Y button, i can do Z"" ""oh, this thing reacts poorly to X, so if i do X, i can scare it away."" It's fantastic, organic, and you can, basically, go anywhere in the solar system. It's also got a fantastic story that made me really think about my life and some more metaphysical thoughts. My game of the year and definitely a top game for the decade imo."
jobs,"I did and got two responses that seemed like jokes. Decided to repost. If I still get nothing, i'll accept it's too niche and leave it be."
boardgames,"Wait, so you can, for ANY die, choose to not keep it, unless it specifically says you must, such as boomers grenade skill?"
AmItheAsshole,Yeah this is definitely a learning experience.
AmItheAsshole,"Fair. And it's why i'm considering not saying that, or at least coming from a ""hey i feel hurt/betrayed"" rather than ""yeah youre kinda shit buddy""."
AmItheAsshole,"I don't think he'd particularly stop me if i threatened legal action, but it's more of a ""hey, my friends A and B are struggling financially and friend A has garbo roommates. I want you, Spader+ Spaders roommate to move out because you both have support while friends A and B don't as much"". So technically, I could fight it. But it would absolutely ruin the friendship."
AmItheAsshole,"After I go off on him, or after this situation is resolved? I'm not gonna rip into him per se, but I feel like he's ignoring my feelings over the feelings of his other, closer, friends."
arkhamhorrorlcg,My main thing is using hyper awareness to boost agility if i deal with nasty encounter cards.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Fair. I'd like to play the guy who can redraw an encounter, but without crack the case, i think i need to stick with milan."
boardgames,"I think my question is, how do you handle these situations when deciding whether to continue to buy their stuff? If *insert famous/great/cool designer* does something really shitty, do you still buy their song/boardgame/videogame/thing?"
Games,"My main concern right now is if I just don't like star wars. Not dislike, just neutral on it. I've never seen the movies, read the comics, played much of the games besides Lego star wars. Is it still good? Will I still enjoy it or is it best for star wars fans? Also, I'm a litttttle worried it may be too much uncharted and not enough dark souls. I'm hoping it's more option B than A."
boardgames,"It's good but it is a bit light and I worry it may not have much replayability for more in depth boardgamers. And its definintely MP Solitaire, for better or worse."
boardgames,Any suggestion on teaching? Iv'e always struggled with it. What I currently do is read the rulebook and watch a playthrough AND have a summary of stuff i go down (lots of bullet points and stuff)
boardgames,"Oh jesus christ, i'm so sorry. I'd probably leave too tbh. And it can be annoying when its that peer pressure of ""heyyyyyy spader, come play *game you dont like such as cards against humanity* itll be fun"" and inwardly im thinking ""oh fuck i hate this please no"" but outwardly i cant just say ""nah im gonna leave"" because i come off as a dick? But yeah, its rough."
boardgames,"I think it's a mix of how I say it (i could definintely be a bit more finesse about it) and just saying it (if i say i think paladins is bland due to XYZ, i think some people would drop their jaws at me)."
boardgames,My tastes are weirdly varied. EX: I'm a predominantly euro guy but i love coup and the arkham horror card game. And I think paladins is too samey with other worker placement games versus say agricola or argent the consortium.
boardgames,"That's an idea tbh. I like to host but when i do, i usually let the group decide. It may be better to say ""hey i wanna play XYZ and im hosting, anyone interested can join but were gonna play (For example) Gaia project, bohnanza, and finally love letter for this night""."
boardgames,"Basically, yeah. I like to put it as this: I like playing boardgames for the social and hobby aspect, but if i had to say, i'd pick the hobby over the social aspect. If I wanna hangout with friends, i'd rather do other activities if its not games i enjoy."
boardgames,"Wow, the sandwich method seems great. I'll try for that."
boardgames,"I do try to emphasize why i dont like it. EX: I dont like nemesis. Some of the reasons i dislike it are the theme seems kinda half assed, the game is bloated (why have crafting), the deck milling is annoying... It may come off as being a dick i guess. I should elaborate on it more i suppose."
boardgames,"I think it's out of print so it's not gonnna be cheap, wherever you get it."
boardgames,"I'm a humongous euro guy. But i like some ameristyle. I'm just really picky. My issue with dungeon crawlers is, i think, that theres not a ton of diverse options. I haven't played many so maybe im wrong but say eldritch horror or mansions of madness didnt give that diverse stuff, and the luck mitigation wasnt great."
boardgames,I considered machina arcana but ultimately passed. Worried I just wouldn't enjoy it.
boardgames,"Completely agree. It's frustrating how much you have to spend, especially if it's a KS exclusive, to get all of the actual CONTENT of the game, or risk not getting it at all. I get why they do it, FOMO, but i dislike it strongly."
Games,"I'm really happy for it, i just wonder how it'll do in the coming months. If they can keep up the quality and low price."
boardgames,"That's my concern. I read up on it. It looks nice, it seems good, but it also didn't really stand out. Yes it's got dice drafting and combos and powers and whatever, but other games have that. What makes you stand out?"
boardgames,"Really? I thought everything you didn't get there you couldn't get period. In that case, i could care less. It's not a big deal. I thought it was CMON's ""oh buy it now or good luck getting it)"
boardgames,"What do you mean by native aliens? And i'm perfectly fine is the rest is available through the publisher/designer. It's just when a lot of it is locked behind KS, forever gone unless youre lucky enough to get on a potential reprint, (im looking at you cmon) it sucks."
boardgames,"Not at all. After all the Kickstarter exclusive garbage, i'm good. I love cthulhu wars but i just cant justify so much KS exclusivity."
boardgames,"Not listening to the rules and getting mad when it takes too long, or annoyed when it's shorter but less rules said."
boardgames,"More critical opinions. Svwag and BGB, so very wrong about games and boardgame barrage, do this well but In general the new hotness or whatever can sometimes overcome any flaws."
boardgames,"Im gonna be that guy and say it: why play this? Liking monopoly, sure whatever it's a bad game etc etc. But you're purposefully, and in the game rules, cheating? Why not play say cheating moth or something like that? Cheaper, easier to play and more fun. And you can call each other out on it"
Games,That's... Not the way to get goodwill from the fan base.
