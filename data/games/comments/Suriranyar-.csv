I've not had a single crash. It also has TES3MP support which is 99% working multiplayer. Unlike skyrim multiplayer this is very polished as the openmw engine is more supportive towards these things.

And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.""

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it.""

First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, ""Nah, forget it.""
– ""Yo, home to Bel-Air.""

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo home smell ya later.""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air

CircleofTrust,Without any bias I got someone else who does not use reddit to pick a word for me.
CircleofTrust,Because you have to find out the word 
DotA2,You have to spell dota minus with techies mines in a ranked game. Trust me i'm a flair mod
DotA2,Your art style is super cute. Really great stuff!
DotA2,"I believe this is the rule free/safe bet to go to. I may be wrong though

DotA2,"dunno why someone downvoted you. You're not wrong, there's actually some complex shit when it comes to mods in that game from the limited time ive played "
DotA2,Man this minecraft mod looks sick
DotA2,"Alright I want this as the map skin. Radiant side can be almost like rivendell from lotr but in the form of underground ruins, while dire side can be a volcanic obsidian jagged cave like area. With obelisks and stony almost hand made looking black trees.   "
DotA2,Very happy to see kotlguy to be at an event:)
me_irl,"Got a good laugh from your comment. They pretty much abandoned all the social and economical pros and cons of being small half way in the movie, so I much prefer your idea tbh"
DotA2,okay sure :)
DotA2,I think you will need the sub reddits theme then :/
DotA2,"yeah I don't know why, I did the thread so it has both the image and text. But its not working on mobile, I will ask around for next time and do testing in advance :p"
DotA2,Did I do something wrong? I got told adding hovertext to the images makes it so mobile users see that instead. And that's what I did :|
DotA2,":\ I made it so the images have hover text, does that not work?"
DotA2,Its like Kills Assists per Life :p
DotA2,"https://puu.sh/zqSTX/aea4a233d2.png This is why I credited aplus in the bottom of the thread :p

DotA2,And done!
DotA2,"Yeah sorry, I had limit time to make the thread since the qualifier games were going on as I was making the thread and the stick space is being used in 10? hours. 100% be a much better thread with more ban information next time "
DotA2,Gonna edit all that now :)
DotA2,"Please let me know how I can make these threads better next time too. On the small chance they would task me with doing another. Let me know if there are any stats you want to know too, there's probably 10x the thread in stuff I dug up, but could not include it all :|

edit: No idea why hero names are not showing on mobile, I got told to add hovertext to the heroes to make it work. 100% next time it will be fixed"
DotA2,Fixing grammar and naming hero icons now also :|
DotA2,"I had to flair your post, that'll be 15% of your karma thanks"
DotA2,"haha yeah, I wish aghs worked with it too, something about the tiny tiny chance of orge doing a 3k damage fireblast combo seems fun :D"
DotA2,As intended it was mentioned in patch notes a while back. I think this was when ogres normal fireblast didnt work but aghs one did. They fixed the normal one and changed the aghs one so it no longer works with the talent
speedrun,"Ah okay, i'm quite uninformed when it comes to this run, thanks for your answer :)"
speedrun,"Yeah he probably did 1 minute of mess ups in the last 5-10 mins alone, could it mean a 1:37 is possible in the next year or so?"
DotA2,i'm sure this post won't give people the idea;/
DotA2,"Sorry, forgot to change it. But someone fixed it for me"
DotA2,I had no idea what to put because they've provided no info so I just assumed it was gonna be lots 
DotA2,"replying to both you and /u/kOmega_ I think i'm fine for now, i got lots of messages helping me what im stuck on though, thanks though :p"
DotA2,"Hello sing mod here, firstly gon and anu7 are idiots, but they are friendly idiots operating inside the law. Sings chat literally did not have rules until myself wrote them (based on stuff sing said in the past) It's like the wildwest like you said, but spam is 100% fine as long as its not racist, nsfw ascii etc. 

Sorry if you feel like this is stupid or crazy but this is how it is and sings chat has made giant leaps to not be a racist cesspit over the last 12 months because of people like gon and anu7, since the core mod team is only myself, gonfr, anu7, knoxeh,meeps and emin (with his bot). So that's good progress from only 6 people in the last year.

Any false bans or crazy stuff or if you wanna ask me question i'm reachable on discord on sings server or the reddit dota server. Or you can whisper me"
DotA2,"yeah guide review is the hardest and the last big part I need to do for the faq, so any help is welcome :3"
Overwatch,"When I watch dota (and I watch a lot) even if its for understandable reasons the pacing of the lans are much slower compared to this so far and the overwatch world cup, I love how on schedule everything is and even how fast the first match was when they first went live. 

Loving the casting and the areana and the level of audio of gameplay compared to the crowd (good crowd hype audio makes me happy). Awesome time watching so far!"
DotA2,Really really like your art style! Looks great:)
DotA2,I hope the mods give you a techies flair now
DotA2,"I helped lili think of ideas for the banner and I said something like ""maybe tusk can be owned by a snowball"" and when I saw the WIP I was like ""yay you did it"":) and it took me until the next day to notice he got hit by a rock "
DotA2,"I will probably change it to the pudge arcana when its out, jealous?;)"
DotA2,"The mods helped lili fit the banner and sort it out because of the strict specifications for a banner, and the mods did all the side bar work on the right! "
DotA2,"Bristle threw a rock covered in snow at tusk and then cm froze bristle. 

Source: I helped lili think of idea for banner and got the mods to agree to it"
DotA2,Thanks :)

DotA2,"copying my comment replying to someone else, iirc its not from a university but its from a college like the ones you get from uk or netherlands, above school but not uni level. I asked about it a year ish ago so take what im saying with a grain of salt

DotA2,"**Keen Team** 

Make a draft consisting of heroes that are ""Keen folk"" in the lore: 

Clockwerk, Tinker, Techies, Sniper, Timbersaw, Gyrocopter, Alchemist. "
Overwatch,"Coming from games where they often have long delays between games or technical issues (even if the long delays can't be helped) The quick pacing, new team colors, casters and panels and all things technical made it one of the best esports events i've watched, it was just really enjoyable in all aspects. Only thing I would have liked a little more was to hear more of the crowd, I felt like I could only hear a certain section at times. "
DotA2,I don't know if you realized but you just posted this twice:) great info regardless! 
DotA2,"Thanks for doing all of these, must be a hassle"
DotA2,"I just tested in test client, you can move the mines and you can stack them!"
DotA2,"He can have a passive where heroes can jump on his plate and use it as high ground and have increased range. Another ability where he will serve up a random item from his inventory and share it with an ally and another where he gives heroes a nice glass of warm milk and it gives them the ""cozy home"" buff granting them damage resistance but makes them a tad slower and his ultimate can be he rings a dinner bell where he targets a place on the map and it guesses every creep on the map to do an attack move to that position but they give like 80% less bounty and no exp and they all look like servants too "
pcmasterrace,meow
pcmasterrace,Good luck me

DotA2,Those poor cats :(
DotA2,"When is the album, deadmouse can play at ti8 finals for an epic throwback "
trailerparkboys,"I've never been so gutted about a death like this before, I was sharing the show with my friends just yesterday and we made it to season 3, fucking sucks. "
DotA2,I woke up today thinking it was somehow 6pm because it was so dark where I am in the uk rofl
DotA2,"well of course they can not do it, i'm not demanding they do it lol"
DotA2,"Yeah agreed, that 7.00 countdown was hype as hell too, maybe try and do one of them if they have a date locked in"
DotA2,"how I like to see it is, 5 minutes of them saying ""the patch is on the way as scheduled, giving a loose ETA"" saves 1000's of peoples time refreshing reddit thats probably at least 5 minutes per person a day, saving lots and lots of time, would be nice"
DotA2,Enjoy the ban:)
DotA2,Well i've been a flair mod (slave) for 3 ish months now and i've flaired 5000 ish posts :| 
DotA2,"Sorry you feel like someone ruined your post, I flair sometimes 100 posts a day and I know I make mistakes looking back on things, it could have been me who did this, but I honestly dont keep track of what I do without having to look in the logs. If you ever feel like sometimes wrong with the flairs or w/e you can always message me here, thanks. That being said your post does come across as a complaint"
DotA2,"Because he flaired it wrong, I fixed it now "
DotA2,iirc he left to work on comedies (like the emoji movie -.-)
DotA2,Gonna miss TJ Miller on that show man 
DotA2,"7 new heroes, new 12v12 map, monkey king now plants land mines, 7.07 and 7.08 and 6 chests, what an amazing patch all in 227mb"
DotA2,"I remember the podcast where charlie, capt, nahaz and grant were talking about ti7 invites and they asked why don't they fixed his camera and grant replied ""Its a staple of my stream"" rofl"
DotA2,I say play what you find fun as long as its not top tier complex because then you will feel more invested to do well/learn
whowouldwin,">God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

This may be the best line i've seen on the sub, if not reddit
 "
DotA2,Oooo that looks really nice!
DotA2,"Shout out to analyst grant too, hes a good guy who's always off camera "
DotA2,"Good to see a range of dota talent and players nominated, cs_summit was one of the only csgo events I watched too and it was a lot of fun"
DotA2,"Click ""flair your post"" or w/e it is and then select ""Fluff"" "
DotA2,"Would be cool to see those event compendiums again, I remember getting the tiny set from starladder 10? that was nice"
DotA2,Try and go for trophies? I think they give good exp iirc 
DotA2,He said he's going to play if its still active when hes back home in 2 weeks
DotA2,oct 1st :)
DotA2,"my special hard working slave reward flair, we don't have to tell the other 3 flair mods, we can keep it between us;/"
DotA2,Can I have my flair pls sir 
KimiNoNaWa,"Just came back from watching it, really glad I did :)"
DotA2,"I pictured wukongs command being Techies command where he places a circle of proximity and stun mines around him, be good in a team fight"
DotA2,"8.00, 4 new heroes, techies and monkey king merged into 1 hero and the game is now first person"
DotA2,"I've became friends with sheep over this year or at least shes my friend she may secretly hate me and she has a fantastic competitive spirit in the months i've watched her play, shes also learned mega fast so i'm sure if she works hard she can do it!:)"
DotA2,"You put it into words I failed to when explaining to my friends, fully agree with what you said"
DotA2,"Damn those seats look pretty comfy, good spacing between the seats too"
Games,"Makes me wonder if it will use the steam market for cards, and the pros and cons of doing so"
DotA2,Happy birthday :)
DotA2,I said it uses the TI archive animations. 
DotA2,They have this (new?)trailer on the store with the TI archive animations http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256692017/movie480.webm?t=1501892798 
DotA2,"Yes you will, the trove carafe is already in the game files (the chest item is, not the cosmetics)"
DotA2,"dota 2 Reddit has an official discord where there are a few 1000 people in it, many will talk games with you :p"
DotA2,Pretty sure valve said majors have to feature all 6 regions 
DotA2,"I hope for as many of those super intense 60 min games as possible where everyone is buying back in crazy fights, one side has megas but refuses to give up, people being 8 slotted, those are my favorite, if I get a few of them I will be happy :)"
SplitDepthGIFS,thanks to /u/ketho for posting the gif on /r/anime
DotA2,"I would say yes, but end of the day no one but valve knows"
DotA2,"The ironwood branch effect seems like a rather random perk for us to have, cool though"
DotA2,It's really odd how he salvaged hosting at shanghai then did a great job at ti6 to not get invited to any valve events this year :(
DotA2,how do you know they fixed it?
DotA2,"Not as much as everyone else but I opened 27 and got 0 rares too, did it right when the update launched"
DotA2,yeah day 70 for ti6 and ti5
DotA2,"I have, waiting on fix I guess"
Overwatch,"Yep, 110 ish heroes and 108 or so get used in every valve event, icefrog is god"
Overwatch,"Since 7.00 Dota has had a balance patch changing 15+ heroes every month or so too, to prepare for ti7"
DotA2,"oh right, I remember that now, thanks"
DotA2,"This is awesome, in my head I think this will mean there are more tier 1 matches this year than last, I hope that is the case, a lot of great dota coming up none the less!"
Overwatch,"some people don't like the paradigms of a ranked setting and play quick play, does not make them bad players, i'm sure many quick play players are better than you/a good few ranked players. That being said, yeah competitive play does have the top players in it for sure"
speedrun,!remindme 12 hours
DotA2,"33 was in a lot of sing streams and he's a great and funny player, really happy for him"
DotA2,"This is my favourite advice, just play for fun, don't worry if you're bad/think you're bad"

DotA2,"The cast was as great as the game itself, favourite of the qualifier i've seen"
DotA2,"I found the cast as great as the game, glad I stayed up for it"
DotA2,"i'm going to guess fwosh did it, but either way its cute"
DotA2,"I saw someone say it happens if you open them too fast, and I got back to back same items when I spammed open too, so it seems that is the case"
pcmasterrace,Please random gods I need factorio;.;
DotA2,"Hey, the reddit discord link is https://discord.me/dota enjoy!"
DotA2,He either really loves purge or really hates slacks 
DotA2,I feel sorry for batrider's bat :(
DotA2,"I actually really like it, reminds me of crystals or something"
DotA2,I missed him at the majors myself :(
aww,shes a she! :p
aww,"Thanks, her only power is being a super loving kitty though :p"
aww,"Truth be told my family adopted her when she was around 3 years old, so shes anywhere between 17.5 and 18.5 years old [Bonus high paw gif](http://i.imgur.com/qfV99Or.gifv) and [Blep from 2009](http://i.imgur.com/qE6JdQW.jpg?1)"
DotA2,"Thanks to the team who uploads these to youtube, one of my friends is not even dota player but are up to date on the memes and enjoy these"
DotA2,Once compendium ends :) 
DotA2,They just form like they do on the normal terrain but aesthetically don't suit in my opinion
videos,"I wish him all the best, always great to see communities come together like this and improve/change/really help someones situation and/or life"
blackdesertonline,"Maybe new branding for the remaster, one can dream "
DotA2,"I enjoy watching him first and foremost because he enjoys himself over trying hard, its very rare for him to give off negative vibes to his group of friends he plays with and the stream, it makes it a relaxed and funny viewing experience.

ps im totally not bias

edit: i'm pasta in chat now I blame you /s "
DotA2,wooooo
DotA2,He did
DotA2,"Yeah, 30 seconds of their time saves I guess hours of added up time of 1000's checking"
DotA2,May 37th boys! 
DotA2,I did not say it did
DotA2,I never said it did.
DotA2,"I agree with you, but i was referring to the ""acknowledging his flaws"" part of what I said"
DotA2,"What do you mean ""not in this case"" I said ""hes very mature in owning up to them and acknowledging his flaws"" and that's something he can do after it happens, and in fact he tweeted ""Mostly I just can't seem to learn how to parse comments or stop caring about how people perceive me.  And I tend to trust people too much"" after the event."
DotA2,"People have different strengths and weaknesses, although nahaz has had emotional outbursts, hes very mature in owning up to them and acknowledging his flaws.  "
videos,I went in with high expectations and wtf this is the best thing I've seen in ages
DotA2,"Hope you had a good birthday, enjoy the io arcana   :)"
DotA2,Price pool spike incoming 
DotA2,Why the terrain I actually died inside
DotA2,Any chance you can make a gif of this?
DotA2,"Well the true sight episode is free for all and was delayed for production reasons, I can't say it will be the same day as battlepass, but its unrelated so probably?"
DotA2,I normally love fwosh videos but the main thing that annoys me about this one is how horrible the audio is balanced 
DotA2,No mention of compendium :(
DotA2,"TI7 COMPENDIUM, WATER SPIRIT, MONKEY KINGS DAD (HARAMBE KING), STEPHEN SPIELBERG ANNOUNCER PACK AND 8.00 "
DotA2,"I just want it ASAP tbh, the thing I'm looking forward to is the hype from the community and the map skin"
DotA2,I actually thought about this myself and I would personally like to see it if some of the cons were worked out or made easier to work with
DotA2,"Strong dislike, I liked the swiss group but dota is way too complex for single elim imo"
Overwatch,"I'm giving you reasons why it should not be wins, so I don't"
Overwatch,"I disagree, I know the clear intention of the event is to get people to play heroes of the storm, but forcing players to learn the game for even a few hours to have a 50% chance to win against new/low skill players will only annoy people and put them off imo, or create toxic games."
