Games,I was able to pre-order the Xbox version on their website... so it might just be an advertising deal?
Games,I hope they will once the award show stars.
Games,"I suspect part of it has to do with the variable hard drive specs that PC users have.  The devs obviously took advantage of the fast drives on the new consoles and didn't bother to port those builds to a pc version, where I assume they'd have to make some meaningful changes to accommodate different drive speeds."

Games,"I could see them taking a break from the franchise and trying something new after Hitman 3.  However, I do hope they return to it because, like you said, there really isn't anything else on the market like it.  Do you think that because the genre has limited appeal, is difficult to design, or for another reason?"
Games,"I totally disagree.  While that may be what most people want, being ""fun"" should not be the objective of all art whether it be books, movies, or games.  The Road is not fun to read, but it is one of my favorite books of all time.  Requiem for a Dream is a gut wrenching movie that is not fun to watch, but I love it as a piece of film and think everyone should see it at least once.  I believe some people think that because TLOU2 is not fun to them it is worthless as a game because it did not meet their desired objective of a ""fun"" video game.  It's totally fine to not like games that are not ""fun"", but I also don't think you should be dismissive of other people who enjoyed something that doesn't meet your expectations."
Games,>!I'm glad that the game does imply that Abby and Lev accomplished their goal of finding the fireflies.  The new main menu after beating the game shows their boat on Catalina Island (where the Firefly base is).!<
Games,"I think a subset of players really feel that way.  I know more than a few people that hate any movies that don't have a happy ending, which probably draws from that desire to have things go ways that are palatable to the viewer/player."
Games,"I actually think that there is a lot of optimism at the end of the game.  >!While Ellie did lose almost everything in her pursuit of revenge, at the end she finally was able to grow as a person and forgive Joel and Abby, which is why she let her live.  Not to mention that Abby and Lev not only survived, but made it to Catalina Island (where the Firefly base is located) as shown in the main menu after you beat the game!<"
Games,"Agreed.  I've never gambled playing Hearts, Spades, or Rummy, and I've thoroughly enjoyed myself every time I've played these games."
Games,"I think it has a lot to do with what people want out of video games.  Jenova Chen (the director for Journey) did a great GDC talk about the game's development.  He started by looking at the emotions that most games give players (empowerment, sense of improvement, etc.) and how he wanted to create a game that invoked a different set of emotions with Journey.  You are right that not everyone would enjoy the type of experience that Journey provides.  For example, if a person wants to feel empowered when playing a video game, then it is unlikely that they would enjoy a game like Journey.

Here's the talk for those curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGCkVHSvjzM"

CollegeBasketball,Thanks for the Zion update ESPN.
CollegeBasketball,This game is still a lot faster than the glacial pace of UVA games.
CollegeBasketball,This audio mix right now is painful.  Good job ESPN.
CollegeBasketball,"Yeah, I don't think I've heard rims this loud on any college bball broadcast this season.  Do they have mics right next to the rim or something?"
CollegeBasketball,This is definitely a Duke home game.
CollegeBasketball,It's honestly very jarring going from watching the pace of a UVA game to a Duke/UNC game.
CollegeBasketball,"I feel like waffles have more substance too them and aren't just a sugary mess.  I also hate sweet tea, so maybe there's something wrong with me."
CollegeBasketball,"I saw it too and had the exact same reaction, haha."
CollegeBasketball,Gotta love ESPN.  I felt sick that entire posession.
CollegeBasketball,Is he the shortest starter in D1 basketball?
CollegeBasketball,On seeing the replay it definitely looked like it.
CollegeBasketball,Shouldn't Rutgers have waited longer before scoring there?
CollegeBasketball,"Even though I want UVA to win out, I really want Leonard Hamilton to get the ACC COY award."
CollegeBasketball,There's TWO OF US!
CollegeBasketball,"The game aside, I love these Duke jerseys."
DotA2,"None of these solutions are ideal, but if playing online couldn't work, I would just award them the DPC points for 13-16th, and play the rest of the tournament with the remaining teams."
DotA2,"I'd love to listen to a DOTA specific podcast, but never got around to listening to any of the ones you mentioned.  Do you recommend any one in particular?"
CollegeBasketball,This game has everything.  Except maybe good offense.
CollegeBasketball,For some reason his dribbling always looks so awkward.
nfl,Tennessee's offensive playcalls have been on point.
CollegeBasketball,24 of 26 free throws?  Is that a legit stat???

CollegeBasketball,This Clemson crowd is loving every second of this.

DotA2,"The Bloodseeker set they included in the Collector's Cache looks terrible, especially in comparison to yours.  I hope Valve starts communicating with artists better, but somehow I doubt there is enough of an incentive for them to change their practices."
Games,"I believe League is bigger basically everywhere in the world, with maybe the exception of Russia and the Philippines, where DOTA is very popular.  It's hard to say for sure because I don't believe Riot publishes concurrent player numbers the same way Valve does, making it hard to compare player populations.

EDIT: To give some context on overall player populations, in 2017, Riot stated that League of Legends had over 100 million monthly players, compared to the 13 million of DOTA 2 at the time. [Source](https://www.riftherald.com/2016/9/13/12865314/monthly-lol-players-2016-active-worldwide)"

TeamfightTactics,"Sorry, I misinterpreted your initial comment.  And yeah, I'd agree that unfortunately there is a group of players that will hate any game Riot puts out just because they are a competitor to Valve.

However, there are legitimate reasons to dislike Riot, just like there are legitimate reasons to dislike Valve.  Accusing all Dota fans of only disliking Riot because they have an ""inferiority complex"" is disingenuous."
TeamfightTactics,"Sure, but I don't think that equates to Dota 2 fans hating League of Legends or their fans."

Games,"True.  I really do want them to make great games.  Some of my fondest video game memories are of playing Pokemon Gold back in the day, and I would love to have an experience like that again."
Games,"I tend to agree with the issues pointed out in this video.  The Pokemon franchise has largely stayed the same for 7 ""generations"" of games.  Sun and Moon seemed like they were changing it up, so I tried to jump back in, but I couldn't stick with it due to many of the reasons he pointed out.

I know the likelihood of Gamefreak truly innovating is low, especially with what we have seen so far of Sword and Shield (why are random encounters still a thing?), but I still long and hope for the day the franchise actually takes a risk in order to improve a 20+ year old formula."
CollegeBasketball,I'm not used to seeing basketball played this fast.  Is this normal?
CollegeBasketball,I really don't get how that was a jump ball...
Games,This is pretty cool.  I wish more people in the video game industry were willing to share their creative/design process as I find game development fascinating.

Games,"You're right in that we likely won't see a new Souls game from Miyazaki any time soon.  However, the possibility still exists.  Regardless, I think this type of mode could be successfully integrated into the types of action-RPGs they have been making for the past few years.

Games,"I'm really glad to see that KoF XIV is still getting a solid number of entrants.  I'm terrible at it, but it is one of my favorite fighting games to watch competitively."
Games,"I think you're somewhat misrepresenting what the devs were trying to say.  Full quote is below:

""Think of it more like we're leaving Prototyping and entering Alpha. Obviously we don't consider that we're actually entering Alpha, this is an example. We're entering a more stable version of what we have been doing."""
Games,"If you read the article you linked, you would see it says that ""Players are defined as those who have played a title in the past three months.""  This means that a viewer could have played the game at some point in the past.  Anecdotally, I know plenty of people that used to play Dota 2, Counter Strike, or League of Legends that still watch big tournaments because they enjoy watching the game played at a competitive level.

EDIT: The article clearly utilizes the percentage you are quoting differently.  It says ""42% of these esports viewers don’t play the game they watch. For these franchises, players have often moved on to other games or spend their time elsewhere, while staying invested in the professional competitive gaming scene. Esports gives lapsed game enthusiasts an outlet to still enjoy the entertainment provided by games without having to develop or keep up with the skills required to play."""

Games,"I can't speak for everyone, but the price of the console isn't the only issue for me.  If I got a switch and wanted to buy another set of joycons and a [grip that actually charges the joycons](http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/16/14285520/nintendo-switch-joy-con-charging-grip), that'd be another $110 I'd have to spend.  This combined with the meager launch lineup and the seemingly lackluster internet subscription service Nintendo is offering makes not want to pick this up at or near launch.  Maybe if they have a bundle sometime next year I'll pick it up, as I do really want to play the new Zelda, Mario, and Splatoon at some point.

And to your second point, it is a piece of new hardware, but people aren't making these purchasing decisions in a vacuum.  For me there are at least seven PS4/PC games coming out this spring that are vying for my time and money.  The value proposition for this console just isn't there for me right now, and I think a number of people would agree with me."

DotA2,Definitely.  Unless you can't stand subtitles as the entire movie is in Spanish.
DotA2,"You are absolutely right, however, the strength of the best EU teams has nothing to do with the qualifiers, since the top 3 EU teams (that didn't break the roster locks) were directly invited anyways.

In order to get a better representation of how well the rest of Europe played at the last major, let's take a look at EU team placement at that event:

Alliance: 9th-12th
Empire: 9th-12th
Team Secret: 13th-16th

While I certainly expect Secret to do better at TI6 than they did at the major, I don't believe that the other qualified/wildcard EU teams will place much better on average at TI6."
DotA2,"You're probably right, but it doesn't really matter when only the top 2 (maybe 3) teams are going to make it into TI6.  Also, if we are looking at qualifier results between the regions, the NA qualified team (DC) placed just as poorly as the EU qualified team (Empire) at the Manila Major."

A lot of people may be looking at this game subjectively, because they directly contributed to its existence in the first place.  Is it wrong for those people to feel some sort of ownership towards a project that they funded?

The backer situation aside, the game is quite pleasant to play.  The world is colorful and unique, the voice acting and dialogue is well done, and the musical score is rather good.  I don't play many point and click adventure games, but I really enjoyed this one.

However, if your team needs you in fights, then you should finish treads first at the very least.  The reason you want battle fury early is so that you can establish your late game dominace as early as possible, through the enhanced farming speed that battle fury provides.

In an optimal game, I usually go poor mans shield, battle fury, treads, manta style, heart, butterfly."
