hockey,"Yeah, but then being a Canadian team would wipe out them winning anything.

DetroitRedWings,"Halfway through reading this I had to check the source, because honestly it felt like something from nhltraderumors.me

The Wings aren't giving up assets to improve their roster with a 29 year old winger who will likely decline by the time they are ready to compete."
DetroitRedWings,He had an ankle injury last year and I believe this year he hurt his hand (fingeys). Hand injuries can really linger and so can ankle injuries. So it could be either. If I was a guessing man I'd imagine it was the hand injury from September.
DetroitRedWings,"To be fair, it's to reevaluate a preexisting injury. Likely just something lingering that they want to get better eyes on and work on. So they would naturally rather not leave him in Europe on a team with far less resources, where he could aggravate the injury. No reason to let an asset reinjure themselves and miss the season so they can play on some other team."
DetroitRedWings,"According to the article for those that don't read it, it's apparently due to an injury.

> It sounds like Filip Zadina will be headed back to North America soon, but not for the reasons most Red Wings fans would like to hear. His Czech team, HC Oceláři Třinec, announced on Twitter that the Red Wings ended the loan to reevaluate a preexisting injury."
DetroitRedWings,"For clarification for any unware and expecting Seider, they can not terminate SHL contracts. They are season long loans. Hronek, Lindstrom, Rasmussen, Pickard, and Larsson are likely the only ones coming back."

TheLastKingdom,"Yeah, I think this season has me walking away from the show. I'll always have Season 1-3."
TheLastKingdom,"Enough that she would condemn her own brother to death? Even then for what reasons? He isn't even really shown to be that cruel until the show decides ""Oh wait, we need him to be less guy trying to restore his family name and more bad guy"" randomly after several episodes. Even then he just has an outburst in court saying the traitors need to be punished. Being pretty upset after finding out his own sister had betrayed him. Also, this supposedly cruel man after catching the group, can easily kill all of them and decides not to. Instead he just asks for them to turn over Aethelflaed's daughter to him; Which are the King's orders. So he has an opportunity to kill the lot outright, instead asks for them to turn over the daughter which the whole court believes has been kidnapped. To whit, his own sister decides then ""Man, I should really just stick it to this evil bastard"" and then convinces the Mercian Guard to turn on their Captain. The guy who we are reportedly told has the upmost devotion and admiration of his men. Then they turn against him because the fugitives they are chasing say ""Uh, he's the bad guy obviously"" and for some fucking weird-ass convenient plot reason Eardwulf is wearing the only evidence that could possibly be used against him around his neck.

It doesn't really make sense, he murdered a messenger who was going to bring news that surely would get him murdered by a cruel minor king known for acting irrationally when angry. His sister then decides to sleep with said King to soften the blow, which doesn't even work. And the King somehow manages to turn begrudgingly consensual sex into a rape.

Then her brother murders said rapist and she then decides. Wow, my brother should probably be killed or exiled and I should betray him.

It's some of the silliest plot I have ever consumed and I am just disappointed. I enjoyed Seasons 1 through 3 immensely. This 4th season has just been all over the place and filled with plot holes and nonsensical story.

Don't even get me started on the like 12 Danes from Ireland just walking into the well defended Welsh castle like it's nothing. All so they can free Brida, someone they don't know, let alone would have an incredibly impossible time finding her whereabouts to begin with."

politics,"Except the local populace won't have an idealogical opposition to foreign invaders. Domestic terrorists here will not have the privledge of the local populace being largely uneducated, dirt poor, and equipped with no to very little infrastructure. They also will have a harder time radicalizing the youth.

The insurgency in Afghanistan is nowhere near comparable to what would happen here.

We also have a superior network of policing and investigation. Making it easier to find cells and catch them before they act. Ala the Michigan kidnapping conspiracy.

Most of these dudes just wanna talk about it anyways. So even then you'll find the 1% of an already small group that is actually willing to do something. They'll have such a monumental uphill battle, that it'll be nearly impossible for a group to acheive anything.

The only true vulnerability is sole actors. People who don't plan with others, don't talk about it. Just one day wake up grab a rifle and go to a public place or decide to bomb a building."

Seaofthieves,"I am literally replying to someone who says there should be custom servers. There is very much a reason you can't do that. That is what I was responding to. I don't care about alliance servers existing. I was commenting on someone wanting custom servers. Which you'd realize if you had read the context instead of immediate jumping to defend.

Having custom pve servers will literally have an affect on the game itself. It'll change the game dyanmic, pvp servers will literally just become death match servers. If you think it wont you're willfully ignorant."
Seaofthieves,"They literally have something. In the game design itself. It's designed for you not to be able to choose a pve server or a pvp server. Alliance servers are not a vanilla part of the game, it's people finding an exploit so they can play the game in an unintended way. 

The chance someone else will steal your prize is a fundamental part of the game and if it's not something you're capable of dealing with then this is not the game for you."

DetroitRedWings,The sim ran for a full month. At the beginning it takes probably a few hours every day and then it sort of tapers off after that. Also the strategy you employ changes how much time you spend.
DetroitRedWings,"So some things to remember, we also had people simulating the agents and we had a trade council monitoring the trades and vetoing sometimes. We're all amateurs doing our best, so sometimes it leads to players signing for way too high or way too low.

Anyways, I am pretty happy with how this turned out. It was a fun experiment.

I obtained a lot of trade bait. MAF serves as either bait for the expansion draft or TDL/Draft trade bait. Especially with our ability to retain 50%.


Oh also, before anyone complains about the 4th ovr selection. I just made it easy on myself and went with the consensus pick. I was more focused on making good picks later on.
And I feel confident that I improved every facet of the team, without going overboard Holland style. This is a team that will still probably finish in the bottom 5, but they'll lose a lot of games 3-2 instead of 5-0."
DetroitRedWings,"There are definitely some things I feel like the recap should mention. There are sort of ""overseer"" type facilities, that approve/veto trades. So sometimes they'll veto a trade if another GM is getting swindled. Which was the case for my original 3-way goalie trade. Which resulted in me taking the 4th and 7th.

I am not huge on Fabbri, I think he has a good chance of being a flash in the pan and I think Domi serves us a lot better. The 3rd for a 4th was easy for me as I had grabbed a lot of picks leading into the draft, so moving back one 3rd for a 4th wasn't a huge deal when I was picking 4 times in the 2nd round.

Along with the Domi/Fabbri, I consider the Toews/Cholowski to be my piece de resistance. It took like a full two weeks to get that one finalized and it had about 200 different versions before it came to what it was. 

Thanks for the feedback, it's definitely an interesting experiment and was a ton of fun to get to do. Really makes you appreciate the whole GM experience a lot more."

We don't need to be told that Auston Matthews, Andrei Svechnikov, Nico Hischier, or Cale Makar are very good pros. This was also created to replace the prospect pool ranking.

It is an entirely pointless list as it really doesn't tell you about the organizations depth because it is skewed by including NHL players. Yes, it's not meant to be a ""prospect pool"" ranking ,but it's also not really an Organizational ranking either. So yes, I do find it pointless.

hockey,"I mean I didn't say it would make the Wings good or even a playoff team. I am just saying Pietrangelo would move the timeline forward. Which is true, so I am not sure who you're debating against because I didn't say anything contrary to that.

Besides it's all just hypothetical because he's not coming to Detroit."
hockey,"He'd definitely move the timeline forward a few years, but I doubt that happens. Doesn't seem like a move Stevie Y would make and coming to the last place team is a hard sell. He's gonna be the top guy anywhere he goes, so the one advantage we have of giving people bigger roles doesn't really apply."
Austin,"Yes, it's a complicated thing. I was simply trying to show in the simplest terms why it's not just a marketing ploy. Bits are also just a lot more accurate as well, I mean bytes aren't even fully standardized. Most round up to 1024, but that's still not even universal. Bits are also tied to IP addresses even. As you said a huge reason is that it's just been that way for so long, a change now isn't realistic.

But yeah, the explanation of bits and bytes would take me giving a long history explanation and then a long technical explanation. The simple truth is there isn't a great simple way to explain it."
Austin,"I linked the article because it had a simplest explanation of what is a fairly complex subject for people with no technical knowledge. I am also an engineer. It was not for marketing purposes and was done long before there were even telecom companies. It's also used heavily in the networking field itself. I mean even IP addresses are using bits.

I know the more popular explanation for anything is always ""marketing"" ,but that's just simply not the case here."
Austin,"There's actually very solid reasons why networking is measured using bits instead of bytes. 

[Here](http://www.ncta.com/whats-new/why-do-we-use-bits-measure-internet-speed-but-bytes-measure-data) is an article that explains it at a very base level."

DetroitRedWings,"Thanks for that, he definitely intrigues me and I am not super big on Drysdale honestly. We'll see what Stevie Y does, even though we only got 4th we're still gonna walk away with an exceptional player. I imagine 5-10 are all chomping at the bit to see who the Wings go with. I mean, 1-3 is set, 4th is the first wildcard pick and there really isn't a consensus 4th. Maybe Rossi at this point. It'll be an interesting draft that is for sure."

He looked so god damn good with the Griffins and then every year you thought ""This is the year Jurco tears it up!"" and it never came and he actually got worse in the NHL. Then I had the ""Watch him now blow it up!"" thought when he went to the Blackhawks and he just did the same thing there.

He'll forever be too good for the AHL, not good enough for the NHL."

Tbf, everyone had Broberg and Soderstrom above Seider as well."
hockey,"That'll happen ,but yep, DDK is currently our arguable 2nd best defensemen behind Hronek. Both are 2nd pairing guys though. Wings super need a true top pairing guy, hopefully Hronek can make that leap or Seider can become that guy in the next few years."
hockey,"He isn't even on the roster, nor is he NHL level considering he played in the AHL this year and only played 18 NHL games.

Patrik Nemeth and Danny DeKeyser are both still under contract and are much better defensemen.

Unless something changes I.E free agency, the opening night roster will probably look like :

DeKeyser - Hronek

Nemeth - Seider

Cholowski - Lindstrom

hockeyjerseys,If you look up quick enough you can see the joke passing right overhead.
hockey,"No, he isn't. Over Nicklas Lidstrom!?"
hockey,"I thought about including that statement, but then we'd have to think about the flipside of it."
hockey,"Two way tie probably between Gordie Howe - Stevie Y ,but I think Stevie Y is the current winner cause a lot more people who are alive have seen him play and were around for the 90s."
guns,You spent that much money on a SCAR-20s and a Nightforce scope and you put a FAB defense foregrip on it?
hockey,"I am impressed on the turnaround on this, I usually have trouble even getting a same week appointment with most of my artists. Let alone same day."
forbiddensnacks,Those things are under a lot of pressure. Source: I shot one with a gun and the cap shot up 50 feet in the air.
hockey,I just want the boys to get hockey where ever they can.
hockey,"A sport in which you scream ""SHOOT!"" at the athletes in all situations."
hockey,It's always made sense.
hockey,"Okay, Oilers."
hockey,I am almost positive they'll try and steal throwing an octopus on the ice from the Red Wings.
hockey,"Like I said, I might be mistaken and I was."
hockey,"Yes, I enjoy it. I think there is a sort of old-school think in sports and a name like this I think helps break that mold a little bit. They didn't go with something safe and boring. They listened to their fans and the community and it was clear a lot of people wanted Kraken.

I might be mistaken ,but I believe it's really the first crowd-sourced NHL team name and I think that is awesome. I also think they have an opportunity for a lot of awesome marketing by using the Kraken name."
hockey,"""They take all the players I don't like and let us keep our best players that we couldn't protect"""
hockey,"The Flames are extinguished, now let's move on and destroy the rest of Alberta. Down with the Oilers!"
hockey,"Dead Wings, no thanks. Also, great music kept happening after the 70s."
hockey,Also the 00s
hockey,It actually happened! Kraken is the name! I am so pumped.
gundeals,I honestly think a lot of it is nerds who hoard like tens of thousands of rounds for some hypothetical apocalypse or gun scare reasons.
hockey,Definitely gotta vote the flames out and then we gotta vote the Oilers out. :)
hockey,Flames gotta go
guns,I didn't downvote you ya fucking weirdo.
AskReddit,I am literally crying
AskReddit,That guy shoulda just claimed he had a carbon monoxide leak and had carbon monoxide poisoning.
guns,"I am aware, this why joke is"
hockey,"My method is just watching the playoffs progress and eventually the team I root for finds me, except for last year. I wanted zero of the teams in the Stanley Cup finals to win the Stanley Cup."
guns,The joke is that I'd have so much leftover after selling 2 scars to build ARs that I could buy a kilo of coke. Thanks for attending my TED talk
guns,SCARS... because I'd immediately sell them and buy way cheaper ARs and spend the rest of the money on idk a kilo of cocaine?
hockey,"There are still playoff teams in this thing! Let's end the playoff teams! 

Oilers and Flames gotta go!"
hockey,"Yeah, I am not seeing his number. Was hoping to see the big guy getting some hockey in."
hockey,Do you know if Moritz Seider is there right now?
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
hockey,"You're not wrong, but this is still a very good thing to see out of an 18 year old."
hockey,Why you gotta do us like that?
mountandblade,"I am in the same boat, I played for about 75+ hours. Probably going to wait for release and mod tools. I loved what I saw and can't wait for them to improve upon a strong foundation."
guns,"Same, I also stopped talking to your mother 20 years ago."
hockey,Sweeping the Canadiens.
technology,"I love when they try to recruit you after you're already in the Military or already did it. Like nah fam, you already tricked my ass once. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, can't get fooled again."
hockey,"Look at the points leaders in the KHL right now, then look at their NHL careers.

https://www.eliteprospects.com/league/khl/stats/2019-2020

It's too different of a league to predict how he will do in the NHL, it just doesn't translate. He is a very good hockey player, but there is always the chance he will have struggles transitioning into the NHL.

Most likely a 40-60 point player, with a chance of being the next Panarin and breaking 70.

It'll be exciting to watch, that's for sure."
hockey,PRETTY SURE THEY'RE GONNA TAKE AN L AT THE DRAFT.
hockey,I mean this is what it looks like when you buy a million dollar home and pay an interior designer to decorate it. They basically just create a display house. It doesn't feel real because it isn't.
gundeals,"Most of their used gun collection is OOS though. It was impressive until I hit the ""In Stock only"" button. I don't know why so many sites do that. Edelweiss Arms has tricked me so many times."
hockey,"Yeah, I think they're probably better off playing in Europe for 20-21 anyways."
hockey,Suter really bet on himself on that one. He's got a lot of talent already ahead of him in their system. Will be interesting to see if he can break the Top 6.
Games,I also absolutely loved the Godfather video games. I remember them fondly.
hockey,I see no issue with this.
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
hockey,"Detroit makes sense from an ice-time perspective. He'll definitely get a shot for an immediate role on the team out of camp. Chicago is a better team with some ice time as well, but it's also a team where there is more depth and he would have to fight harder for his role."
hockey,"Thanks for sending that, was curious to see what the connection was, but I'd agree that it does seem like someone the Wings would take. Would be cautious of a Kaski 2.0 though."
hockey,"Hi, I got you this flair : https://i.redd.it/lvhsfwsd20911.png"
hockey,Any source on the rumors? Very interested as a Wings fan.
guns,Wouldn't an uncut rug be like the opposite of what you would want?
guns,You need to get a gold scope to mount to the top.
hockey,Imagine if Lindros ever played for Dallas.
hockey,"Mike Green and his family still live in DC, I am fairly certain. So I don't think it would be any weirder for him as he is not in Edmonton."
hockey,What is dead may never die
hockey,"Listen put aside all of your personal grievances all your petty rivalries. We all have a true common enemy, the Communist Nation of Canucks.

**VOTE OUT THE CANUCKS BEFORE THEY COME FOR YOU!**


**VOTEZ LES CANUCKS AVANT QU'ILS NE VOUS VOTENT!**"
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
hockeydesign,"I would like the Wings one, but black would never be one of their colors. The black would probably be replaced with white."
hockey,Shocked they aren't most of the list.
drunkencookery,That's still drunken cookery. Go to shittyfoodporn if you just want slopfests. We welcome all here.
drunkencookery,Everything in this sub is what this sub is about.
hockey,"Doubt Stevie Y will make a move for Ghost, but it would be interesting to see. He has loved his reclamation projects. Actually, I change my first thought after looking at his stats from this year. He is 100% someone Stevie Y would make a move for, but only if he is fine with what he has to give up. So if it did happen it likely wouldn't be a great trade for Philadelphia. Although as you said, it's likely they lose him in the expansion draft anyways and combined with how low his value is right now. Getting an average prospect or a pick is probably better than nothing."
Games,It made me giggle the most to be completely honest.
gundeals,M17/M18 in stock anywhere. Can't seem to find any.
hockey,Don't be manipulated by the Canuckian threat!
hockey,Not if you keep reminding people they're an option.
hockey,[That's the same plan we have every night pinky!](https://media.giphy.com/media/FghMhtvvwQbNS/giphy.gif)
hockey,So we're all voting out the Canucks first right?
guns,Now you just need to find the Blood Diamond Pants.
guns,I was today years old when I learned this thing existed.
SigSauer,Where did you find an M18 in stock?
Games,"> Because ~~those game suck~~ 

I am not gonna disagree with that, haha. I myself do not want to go back to those days. I was just saying I guess I understand the appeal of trying to cash in on people's nostalgia. I mean there has to be someone still rocking spiked hair, tapout, and drinking four lokos while listening to Alter Bridge that totally misses Blood Rayne."
Games,"I thought that too, as soon as he turned into a werewolf. 

[Demonik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b5TI_Z6eRg) was the name! I never knew they were actually trying to make that into a real game."
Games,"This is the same game right? Joking aside, cashing in on people's nostalgia is usually a sure-fire way to have a successful release. Look at all the isometric RPGs that came out that really aren't doing that much different from the Baldur's Gate days. Why not start making callbacks to the high-intensity action blood smoothie games of the 2000s as well?"
Games,"When I first saw it my initial thoughts were immediately ""This looks like a game that came out in like 2006."" From the music to the way the trailer is cut, to the edgy tag lines and even the gameplay itself. I think you said it perfectly though, it's a game from 2006 made with 2020 technology. It honestly looks like the game from Grandma's Boy."

hockey,"I really hope it goes to a random undetermined NHL team that loses in the playoffs this year. That would obviously never happen though, because who sort of maniac would have a draft lottery where half the teams are ""TBD"". That would just be ludicrous.

Sarcasm aside, I do think the best possible outcome is probably Minnesota getting it. They could use a win."
guns,Yes! I can't wait to see it!
guns,"I really need to see a ballistic gel test of this now. My curiosity, it must be sated."

hockey,Team America will be pretty sick at this point as well.
AskReddit,"As someone who has always had an interest in expatting, it has always struck me as odd at how much America gets shit on for immigration (even pre-Trump). We're not perfect, but honestly, a lot of other places in the world wont even give you a shot unless you're a refuge, basically have a doctorate in your field, or are rich."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
hockey,You draft in the order of the amount of goals your GM scored in the NHL. With the highest amount going first.
hockey,"I remember watching that highlight video, thinking it was a 5 minute affair. I thought I had just watched half a season of highlights and was thoroughly impressed with how good the kid was over the season. It was then that I realized I had only watched highlights of his first 2 or 3 games. 

His IQ is seriously impressive. The best part is that Seider is lowkey meaaaaan. His defensive stick work is also insane for an 18 year old kid. I've seen very few 18 year olds play how Seider plays defensively."
hockey,"Sharks were a really fun team and made pretty good playoff runs, my favorite team the Wings had stopped being in the playoffs so it seemed like a good time to pick up a second team. Then a year later they made their SCF run and I was fully sold on them.

This season has been rough."
hockey,"Kanye, because I just wanna be able to tell the story of whatever he does at my birthday. My money is on him just celebrating his own birthday, even though our birthdays are several months apart."

hockey,Stutzle excites me a lot more.
