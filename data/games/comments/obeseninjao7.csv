assassinscreed,"I haven't tested flying Synin away while on horseback yet, so I don't really know what the distance limit is...

As for not being able to mark enemies, I personally play without the compass on, and it makes Synin much more valuable for tracking POIs and quest objectives. You can put markers on up to three things with Synin. The markers don't move though, so if you tag an enemy and they walk away, your marker will be outdated.

Generally though, Odin Sight is much more useful for stealth - it's basically Eagle Vision from AC Syndicate. Synin is used more for tracking which direction you need to go in, or trying to scout out a building to find an entrance etc."

We probably won't be doing this for the time being - we only have the space to pin 2 posts at once to the front page, and at the moment they are both being used. 

If you or someone else wants to make weekly threads for what is in the Thousand Eyes shop then feel free (assuming it's even synced for all players at once - it may be per-game). Just a word of note - we are considering Reda himself a spoiler for the time being.

**For the record**, it doesn't have much of one. There are a few references here and there (and a minor mechanic called Citizen E which takes place in-animus). Basically the entire modern day lore of Liberation is that it is a video game produced by Abstergo Entertainment, and as such is all in-animus. Also, because it's a game made by Abstergo, there are a couple... changes to the true history to make it a bit more sympathetic to the Templars. The game touches on this in a few scenes, but it's all done in-animus, and there is very little modern day lore that affects the rest of the series.

Games,"Powerplay is extra dead at the moment because people discovered how to sabotage.

Theres an entire meta based around bot accounts joining the faction of your enemy, grinding loads of political influence and then voting for your enemy to take costly actions in worthless systems.

And because solo play (where you can't encounter other players) shares the same background simulation as all the other modes, these bots just grind it out in complete safety in single-player, meaning the only way to combat it is to grind harder than the bots to outvote them."

Valhalla is set nearly a year and a half after Odyssey's Fate of Atlantis DLC, so is something of a different arc for the character. It's worth playing if you care about Layla's story, but you should be able to just look up the cutscenes if you want to know how it ends.

For what it's worth - You can jump in anywhere really. AC2 is a good place because it is the start of Ezio's story. If you want the entire plot, you will want to play all of the games.



**Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit via modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/assassinscreed) if you have any questions or concerns.**  
Direct messages or chat requests to moderators will be ignored."
Games,"The biggest problem is that there is nobody responsible for the meta plot or lore. AC has no lore master, and often the writers use the fan made wiki for lore information. Each game's team chooses where they want to take the plot whenever they get up to it. This is why Odyssey's modern day story basically ignores everything Origins set up about the nonlinearity of time and the ability to rewrite the equations of time reality-is-a-simulation vibe in favor of introducing some both-sides-bad prophecy and an immortality staff.

Valhalla has tried *hard* to collapse those elements together into some kind of meaningful conclusion. I've only seen the first modern day segment so far, but I'm surprised at how well they've managed."
Games,"AC2 wasn't exactly the direct prequel to 3, though I think your point stands somewhat anyway.

There were 2 more games between 2 and 3: Brotherhood and Revelations."
Games,"The tl;dr for what happened since 3: very little. AC4, Rogue, Unity and Syndicate were building towards doing something with the first civilisation ghost person that desmond released from the temple in AC3. When I say ""building towards"" I mean only AC4 and Syndicate did anything about it, and in both cases it was basically nothing anyway. Then the writers rebooted the story in Origins and kicked the existing plot to the comics.

Then since Origins it has been about Layla Hassan, an Abstergo employee - turned Assassin who as of Valhalla has been slowly turning into a psychopath due to influence from being addicted to the Animus + being spoken to by a magic possessed immortality staff. And now the world is ending in Valhalla. That's pretty much it."
Games,"Some definitely do still have it, but it's usually only the ones that involve proper dialogue rather than all of them. Odyssey had the problem that every interaction looked somewhat identical because most cutscenes in the game were built from a dialogue camera and like 15-20 pre-set animations."

By the way, he is an easter egg/reference to Origins. Origins also had a travelling merchant kid called Reda who served a similar purpose. Origins is of course set in and around 47 BCE, so a very long time before Valhalla. Him knowing about things from the past is just an easter egg, basically.

ETO is an alternate, untraceable currency that Dedsec uses because it's worth more than pounds, has no physical trace, and can be used to buy everything they need."

assassinscreed,">Why is sexuality even relevant in the first place?

In short, it's not really relevant. It's only as relevant as you want it to be. For most of the characters in this list, things like their sexuality or gender are a pretty minor aspect of their character, and it's just here for completeness. In some others, it makes for some interesting historical trivia to know that AC's portrayal of them might have been a bit simplistic (Mary Read, Isaac Newton). And in some others, it actually fleshes out the characters and gives them more depth (Jacob Frye is a good example of this - his bisexuality in the time period might give an insight on why he had such a strained relationship with his father, why he cares so much about helping the downtrodden and marginalised - it turns him from a rowdy meathead into a character with a bit of actual depth).

Sexuality and gender is not relevant at all to stabbing templars, I agree with you there. But AC is unique as historical fiction - it uses real people as lots of its characters and it's interesting to see how certain aspects of these people match up to the real history. This post was prompted when another user on here made some comments I saw about Mary Read in real history *very possibly* being a transgender man, or otherwise nonbinary. I never knew this or even thought about it, but it was a really cool thing to think about for me (a nonbinary person). People of diverse sexualities and genders existed throughout all of history, we know this for a fact (transgender roman emperors, lots of gay people all through history, the third-gender categories of native americans and some Asian countries, that ""female"" viking skeleton could have just been a transgender man, etc) but it's often obscured by years and years of history that obscured it because people didn't want to believe it. So, learning about some historical figures in a new light I hadn't thought about before was really cool, and I was motivated to try my best to provide that opportunity to other who might benefit.

To most people who saw this post it's going to be just trivia - nothing super important or revolutionary. To some queer people who might not have realised they have stuff in common with people through history, it might be fascinating or even reassuring (remember that a common line from homophobes/transphobes/etc is that ""x is just a fad"" or ""x is just a modern trend"" - it can be hard not to internalise that and subconsciously believe it: you need the evidence in front of you to snap out of it, at least I did.). Obviously, idk if anyone gained value from this other than me - maybe nobody at all cared about this post. But at the end of the day, I learned a lot doing the research, and hope that maybe someone else did too by reading this post, and that's the only reason it needs to exist."

To answer your question: Both are canon. How? We don't know - it's one of the game's central mysteries. Supposedly you can figure it out due to clues throughout the story, though it will be clearer if you use the ""Let the Animus decide"" option (which is effectively the ""canon"" option).

I might be able to help you with this one: Like in Origins and Odyssey, the enemy you have locked on to switches if you move the right stick (or I am guessing the mouse on PC). Try to avoid moving the stick while locked on. Alternatively, in group fights maybe don't even use the lock-on, it isn't really necessary.

For the record, from what I have played, it seems that each time you complete an Animus Anomaly, you get a file unlocked in the laptop (though the game shows you this whenever you finish the anomaly). Otherwise, you probably only really *need* to leave the Animus when the game brings you out.
