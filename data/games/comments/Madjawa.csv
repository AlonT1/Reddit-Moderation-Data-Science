GenshinImpactTips,"As long as the ultimate remains on field when you swap out from her (don't see why it wouldn't, tbh.) I'm planning on using her with Keqing, Fischl, and either bennet or barbara, depending on the situation. I think she'll be decent with barbara as between the taunt/freeze, you'll have plenty of time to heal your team off of Barbara's auto attacks then swap back to a DPS.

 I've been using Xiangling in that slot thus far and while Goubu does a ton of damage (when he hits) overload with Keqing is rough as you spend most of the time running around chasing monsters due to knockback."

GenshinImpactTips,"I'm not sure, but having elements on weapons effects would be really neat! Imagine if something like Skyward Atlus could proc swirl with it's little death orb?

That being said, there could be issues with anti-synergy depending on the characters/enemies involved. If it was a domain where you get punished for using one kind of ice reaction, but rewarded for other reactions, it could really throw a wrench in your gameplan."
GenshinImpactTips,"I think a lot of it is from there, yeah. For stuff like .png bases for icons it's definitely the best place to go imo"

GenshinImpactTips,"Hey folks, I'm leaving this for the time being as it's created a decent amount of discussion, but how we wish to handle ""leaks"" is something we've yet to decide officially, and we'd like your input as well. (Feel free to reply to this comment with your takes)

Things to consider here: A random user who 'knows a dev' is far from a reliable source, so take any information from this thread (and, to be honest, all leaks in general) with some massive grains of salt."
GenshinImpactTips,"One thing to be careful of here is that Chongyun and Keqing are pretty anti-synergy if you focus on Keqing's electro damage, as those damage bonuses won't apply in Chongyun's ice field, even if you use her skill (Chongyun's effect takes precedent, and you can't double-enhance auto attacks)"
GenshinImpactTips,"The sword is -really- nice if you have a high crit rate sword user. I've recently swapped to it on Keqing and it's a huge boost to damage uptime because in domains I don't need to be swapping to barbara nearly as much. 

As far as who to go to 90 with, I think it depends a lot on who you like to use as your main dps. Personally I'd lean towards Xiangling if you're using her a physical dps with crescent pike, or Ningguang, as they're effective on the largest variety of enemies. Late game domains seem to be all about punishing specific reactions/elements, so having a great physical/geo/anemo dps really helps in that regard."
GenshinImpactTips,"I'm not sure on Diona, but for Xinqgui I honestly think 2x Exile and 2x Scholar is pretty good, as his ultimate really takes a while to fill up given how long the cooldown is on his ability. Preferably you'd be looking for everything but the Cup slot for those, then any 4-5* Hydro damage % cup"

japanlife,"Not so much this year, but have had past academic years with some utterly useless teachers, including one who lasted all of 2 months before bailing entirely and leaving the other teachers/me to juggle their horrifically behaved class the rest of the year. 
Ironically they turned into a great class the following year once they got a better homeroom teacher. 

Still have one class that was terrible last year and can be a bit rough sometimes this year, but it's still a marked improvement. Their former teacher was so spineless kids would be mocking/chatting/laughing in the front row in front of her -while- she was in full teacher burst lecture mode.

 Personally I found it best to just shut my brain off, do the readings when asked for the 5% of the class who gave a shit, and try not to let it bother me. Chances are they aren't just awful during English time, and the school is likely aware of the problem."
japanlife,"Some of the attempts at small talk in the staffroom are just... so damn braindead them 'forgetting' where you're from doesn't surprise me in the slightest. ""Oh, you going home for Christmas?"" Yeah let me get right on that. Never mind the fact we just met to discuss the class we're running -on Christmas Day- 20 minutes ago. 

I agree with the other commenter though, definitely try to shut that shit down."

japanlife,Supposed to hit 16 up here tomorrow. That's pretty much a full blown summer day!
Games,"For PS4: You do -not- need PSNow to stream to PC, PSNow is it's own separate game streaming service, afaik. You can also stream to Vita off a ps4. Generally speaking the use case for PS4 remote play was pretty limited, as you could only stream around 720p max and there's input delay, but for turn based stuff/setting up downloads while you're out of the house it's an option. 

Streaming is the console itself, so you can tweak settings/download stuff if need be (fun aside, someone hacked my PSN and set their PS4 in the Middle East as my primary console, so I was able to remote play into it, de-activate it from my account, and delete their downloaded games as a parting thank you gift.)

For PS5: EDIT: Tried this out last night. Works pretty good with a Dualshock 4. streaming 1080p Astro's Playroom looked alright on PC, with very little input lag (on local network, at least.) Worked fine, except some network issues on my end (having my PC's IP address set manually seemed to break something until I set it back to automatic.)"
Games,"Oh, thanks for the heads up! I had no idea. I tried to edit the quick menu to see if there was an option there but didn't think to check the icon. 

Definitely agree about the hidden info being obnoxious. I think on a per-title basis would be best. Say you're doing a story-based game and go back for trophies later, being able to just reveal the hidden info for the whole game once you've done your story playthrough would be very useful."
Games,"Have been pretty happy with mine so far. Astro's Playroom was far better than I expected, wasn't expecting the controller to be so... involved? Looking forward to getting into Demon's Souls over the weekend. Haven't tried any ps4 titles yet as the back and forth over external hard drives causing issues is a bit spooky. 

New UI is fine for the most part, but I hope more titles actually make good use of the cards in the future, as they seem kind of lackluster from what I've tried. Also, as a trophy hunter, not having easy access to them from the base home menu/cards kind of sucks (have to go to the actual home menu, then the game, then over to the trophy list to access them.) 

Overall having a good time. Looks great, sounds great, controller is by far one of the more impressive gaming experiences I've had. My PSVR camera adapter came in recently as well, so will be setting that up over the weekend to see if there's any performance gains on VR titles."
JETProgramme,"It isn't, ours is a small placement and no one is changing here for at least a couple more years."
JETProgramme,"One part fun fact, one part advice: Almost any reference of my placement + JET Program turns up some sketchy results due to a former ALT.

Take anything you read about your placement online with a big rock of salt. The only information I could find about my placement was a blog/some interviews with someone who had the placement before my predecessor, who claimed (still claims?) the area is nothing but horrible oppressive racist people.

Suffice to say said person's view of the town/experiences and the reality of how their short tenure out here went are uh... extremely different (they even edited the town's English Wikipedia page with some of their claims, which got reverted for vandalism, if that gives you any clue.) I was a bit put off and worried at first, but now I'm headed into my 5th year and have loved it here. Folks are nice, location is lovely, BoE is almost always on our side, etc.

While naturally, they don't like to talk much about said former ALT, what little I have gleaned is decidedly not good. Like, might very well be on a prefecture-wide blacklist not good."

(dude's been playing since the earliest betas and is AR 50) Enviosity's abyss floor guides are decent, though there's a lot of filler content in his other content. If reading is more your style the /r/KeqingMains discord and sub are absolutely PACKED with data/math/min-maxing that is super interesting and valuable, even if you're not using Keqing."
GenshinImpactTips,"I'm not entirely sure on the soft pity numbers, outside of knowing that if you're trying to save a pity for next banner you should stop earlier than ~65 so you don't accidentally pull a 5*. I will say tracking your previous wishes is incredibly easy, as on the wish screen there's a ""history"" button which will show your last month or so of wishes for various banners (limited/weapon/permanent)"
GenshinImpactTips,"Rather than just list some characters, here's some interactions/synergies to consider: 

Barbara + ice whatever = easy freeze whenever.

Diona + Ningguang = shield stacking, which can be very nice, and Ningguang does a ton of damage. 

Xiangling + Chongyun = easy access to melt, can infuse Xiangling's spear with ice for shields (namely thunder hammer Fatui) 

For just roaming the world I like having a healer and a claymore user for mining, so would probably do Chong/Barb/Ningguang/Xiangling. 

Might have to swap things for certain bosses (Diona could be good here for more shielding, as any domain/boss involving ice realllly sucks for Barbara)"

I hope they at least keep it on life support until whatever they cook up next is ready, have some charges on Amazon on mine that are supposed to be going through this week... It's been much more convenient then trying to sign up for a credit card here/having to buy prepaid cards for shopping online.

Quick follow up edit: Just got an email saying that for the time being you can still use it, just have to charge at the ATM/Call the hotline to check balances etc."
GenshinImpactTips,"And it's not even really sunk cost if you use him as a support in T2 in abyss later. While you definitely don't want to overlevel too many characters, having ones that just fall over because they're level 5 isn't great either."
GenshinImpactTips,"I'd go floor by floor, there are some where you'll want Xiang and Diluc as they'll be useless on a half, and a few floors where you -really- want a fire character on each team. 

T2 my initial recommendation would be: Venti/Bennett/Xiangling (or whatever other primary DPS you have/make)/open (you're aforementioned water character or someone that can make use of Venti's ult for a nice combo.)"
GenshinImpactTips,"I haven't gotten him quite yet, so someone else might correct me but from what I've watched/read Bennett is -incredibly- useful in abyss as a healer.

 While Noelle can absolutely be a bruiser, in later floors of abyss Breastplate really only blocks one or two attacks so you either need massive investment or very good dodge skills/ultimate uptime on her to have her as a solo healer. That being said if you've already invested into her and have an open support slot using her to make and break shields + spot healing is definitely a good use case."
GenshinImpactTips,"Later on absolutely, especially in abyss. As you unlock higher level domains and abyss floors things start doing a -ton- of damage. Hitting AR 40 I went from probably not needing a main healer at all to sometimes having to run around tanking/dodging with barbara while healing up the rest of team who is about to die because they took 2-3 hits."
GenshinImpactTips,"I think it depends on the content, If you're just hanging around the world I'd swap him in for Barbara as the healing from letting the rain swords expire is usually enough to keep a team topped up in-between fights, and having access to his ultimate w/ fast attackers like Xiangling is pretty nice. If you prefer having a dedicated healer 100% of the time I think swapping Xiangling out is fine."
GenshinImpactTips,"Depends on what you're doing, but generally I'd say Barbara, as healing without wasting food/teleporting to statues of seven is very valuable in the long term."
GenshinImpactTips,"Please direct all simple/non-discussion questions, as well as team-building questions to the Weekly Question Thread [here](https://reddit.com/r/GenshinImpactTips/about/sticky?num=2). Thank you for understanding."

I really didn't like using Venti either, even at C2 (accidentally hit 2nd pity trying -really- hard for Barbara's last constellation.) and kept him at level 1 for the occasional Anemo puzzle/wind tunnel.

Eventually decided to give him a chance as a support over Fischl for a bit and I feel a bit better about him now, just basically using him on cooldown to gather stuff/as a support in 2nd team for abyss. Honestly it's nice to be able to cycle through some characters depending on the situation."
GenshinImpactTips,"Lineup seems fine, at this point it's literally just checking what floors have what types of enemies and deciding who goes with who. Barbara on one team, Xingqiu or Noelle on the other for healing.

 I typically roll with 1 main dps, 2 supports, and a healer per abyss team. I recommend using chong as a support with Keqing as superconduct's defensive debuff is extremely strong in abyss, where most things are really tanky. Who you want to use as the main DPS for the second team is up to you/constellations/gear. I personally use Xiangling + Crescent Pike as the doublehits + high crit just shred through smaller enemies."
GenshinImpactTips,"I'll chime in here too: Can add it to the sidebar and experiement with some Automoderator for the tech support things, but even with the megathread and a few automatic things redirecting folks there the vast majority of our removals are basic questions from folks who don't use the mega. 

I tend to agree with you on the video content. We're still working out what stays and goes on a case by case basis, but there are definitely some extremely low-effort videos that get through/some users we are aware of who consistently post them. I'd ask if you can report those kinds of videos when you see them, as that will guarantee we see it in a timely manner."

GenshinImpactTips,"Those will fill in once you activate the Statue of the Seven in that area! (kind of a big grey orb-ish icon on the map.) So far you can just go walk to all but one of them, so if you want you can just head straight for them when you hit new areas! They also tend to have a red beam that shoots up vertically from them making it easier to find"

GenshinImpactTips,"Absolutely nailed it.

 I've updated the automoderator to hopefully make that a bit more clear, and we will be much stricter on the TL;DW rule starting this week."

GenshinImpactTips,Thanks for the information! Definitely was wondering about it.
GenshinImpactTips,For 25: I generally wouldn't invest too heavily into blue artifacts unless they've got exactly the stats you need. For purples if they have at least 2 that you need I'd go for either +4 or +8 at this stage. If you get more great/good stats you can go for +12 or even +16. There are good videos going over artifacts in the [guide wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpactTips/wiki/guides) that explain it a bit more in depth.

Games,"It actually is. Luffy, a professional fighting game character has been using OG dualshocks in tournaments for years using adapters."
GenshinImpactTips,"Yeah the weapon EXP will absolutely be an issue I feel. That being said the only thing that actually makes me worried about the viability of this is that all of the later floors of abyss need 2 teams, so unless we get some other free folks soon you'll have to do something like a 3/3 split, and will only have a healer on one of those teams."
GenshinImpactTips,"Honestly this seems like a really cool idea. I've been using my accounts NA character (main is on Asia) as a F2P and it's been an interesting challenge, but this seems like a whole 'nother tier. I'm definitely on board."

For 2nd team stuff: Definitely start working on Jean as you absolutely need a healer for your 2nd team. I use Chonyung a bit, but you don't need to level him super hard as I usually just drop his ice field then swap to my main dps, for stuff like fire shields."

GenshinImpactTips,"Would probably go for something like Klee, Diluc, Noelle, and Sucrose. Can then use Beidou, Barabara, Traveler, and either Chongyun or Xiangling depending on the floor for abyss team 2."
GenshinImpactTips,Sounds like artifacts might be holding you back a bit. Might want to make sure you're using some relevant ones with attack for the time being.
GenshinImpactTips,"Down the line you're probably gonna want 2 teams for abyss anyway, so I wouldn't be too upset about resources spent on Klee (Thus far Fire has almost always been useful in there.) 

With c5 Xiangling I'd definitely recommend grabbing the Crescent Pike for her from forging. 

As far as teams go: For basic world exploring you'd probably be fine with something like Venti+Xiang or Klee + Fischl + Qiqi. If you're not getting hit much can even swap Qiqi out for xiang/klee for the double fire bonus. 

I think Klee could be very useful for breaking shields on your team, as even though Xiangling is fire, Gouba's targetting/inability to move really sucks sometimes."

GenshinImpactTips,"Thanks for your interest in participating in our sub! Unfortunately, we have to remove your post, this could be for several reasons as outlined below (as well as fixes you can implement that will be received better here). We're pretty strict on what we allow here, as we want quality posts only:

* In all cases we require you to provide a TL;DW of your video in the comments to ensure you aren't spamming your content.

* Low Effort Content Creation posts are generally not allowed here. If your post is 2+ minutes of you screen-recording your character solving one basic chest puzzle and not much else, that's why.

 * Try adding some dialogue to the video as well as showing several chest locations nearby.

* Content Creator spam to self-promote your YT, Twitch, or other platforms on multiple subreddits.

 * At minimum you will need to provide a TL;DW, and even beyond that, we likely won't allow your content here. This isn't a platform to grow your channel on, sorry. :(

* Basic news that any player will see the moment they log in, like a new banner summon. This isn't a ""tip"" or ""strategy"", it's just low-hanging fruit to promote your channel, and we don't allow that here, sorry.

 

If you are a content creator, we still want you here, you just have to follow our rules and provide high-quality content that will *actually help people* with the game - complicated puzzles, character interactions that are not well known, some unique weapon combination. All of these are welcome here as long as your videos are not overly click-baity and you aren't spamming 700 subreddits.

If you feel like this is an unjust removal, feel free to message the mod team and we will review and give you next steps to have your content allowed here. :)"

Genshin_Impact,"stick with Lion's Roar, it's one of her best weapons by a pretty large margin. AFAIK you're gonna be better off with the ATK% artifacts over EM"
GenshinImpactTips,"Fischl/Xiang/Barbara + a main dps or one more support all work pretty well together, so traveler would be fine I think. You can fischl with dps but look up crescent pike if you have the materials to forge it, as it turns Xiangling into a powerhouse (basically when active the bonus damage is an EXTRA HIT that can crit on its own, so every individual hit of her spear flurry attack is hitting again)"
GenshinImpactTips,"Diluc is pretty much top DPS in the game from a numbers standpoint.

 Barbara and Noelle are mostly healers, so pick one of the two. (barbara is a bit more consistent imo) 

That leaves you 2 support slots you can use depending on the situation. Surcrose is a great all around support. Chongyun's ability works with all sword users as well so he's not a bad 4th character, I'd say."
GenshinImpactTips,"I use the same team! Building him up a little bit to use on a 2nd team for abyss is how I ended up using him. double electro with Keqing and Fischl is just really hard to pass up on, as it gives you almost 100% uptime on Oz and Keqing's ultimate."
GenshinImpactTips,"Yes, they do. The only platform that doesn't have cross saving at the moment is PS4"

GenshinImpactTips,"When you get to needing 2 teams for abyss you'll want your DPS ~60, and usually your supports ~40ish, or else you're likely to run out of mora/materials for upgrades. 

As for what teams to use it really depends on the specific floor. You can preview what enemies are coming, so as a general rule of thumb try to keep: 

* A healer in each party. Barbara/Noelle is fine, so long as you play carefully with the Noelle team
* Ideally one main DPS per team. For me that's Keqing and Xiangling, for you it'll likely be Diluc and Fischl. 
* Whatever you need for specific enemies. You lose a -TON- of time if you don't have something that can quickly react with and disable shields of various elements later on. In earlier floors you'd use these slots usually for combos or grouping enemies, as they really like to spread out, particularly in floor 3."

GenshinImpactTips,If Barbara is only 2x you'll most likely be better off with Jean. 5* units spike -hard-. C0 Keqing blows my C6 Xiangling with refined Crescent Pike out of the water.

GenshinImpactTips,"Hey folks! My name is Madjawa and I'm also a new addition to the team. I'll be adding some useful links and the start of our very own wiki page to the sidebar over the next couple of days, as well as working on some behind-the-scenes stuff. Looking forward to working with you all~!"
Genshin_Impact,"Yeah, it's not like you're going to clear the entire area with it but if you run near to the base you can land on top of pillars without climbing at all, or at worst w quick ledge grab."
Genshin_Impact,"No problem! 

Fire and electric in general work very nicely together. My current team is actually Keqing, Fischl, Xiangling, and Barbara. Basically using Fischl and Xiangling to drop their pets, then swapping to Keqing for big damage/spamming her abilities. Since electro-shock damage depends on the electric characters stats for damage I can also swap into barbara for that/healing when I need it."
Genshin_Impact,"For characters it's definitely on a character per character basis. While they all benefit from constellations, depending on what you're using them for can change things pretty drastically. A few characters have pretty important constellation bonuses early on, such as Fischl's which massively improves her dps. 

Weapons are more of a 'nice to have' thing in my opinion as they don't add anything new, they just make numbers bigger for the most part."
GenshinImpactTips,Sent! Would gladly work on things here rather than my somewhat half-baked attempt at a meta sub I made when I didn't realize this one existed :)
Genshin_Impact,"I'm at 33 and working through floor 6/7 atm. hitting the next world level/ascension tiers goes a long way for getting through the first 5, then you get stonewalled by needing 2 teams. Floor 5 is a dual team one but the 2nd half segments are incredibly tame. 6+ is dual team but pretty much full segments for both halves (both halves having 20+ enemies, for example.)"
Genshin_Impact,I stuck with Favonius until I happened to get stringless from the venti banner. Definitely worth sticking with as it gives you really good uptime for Oz.
Genshin_Impact,"I would say if she's your main dps slingshot might be better. If you're just bringing her in to drop oz/do a few hits favonius, as you can just swap her in, do a charged headshot for the orbs, and keep great uptime on Oz."
Genshin_Impact,Yeah. I think I tried it right at AR20 and it was definitely a struggle. 3-2 in particular was really rough as the enemies were incredibly tanky without having another world level advantage over them. The good news is if you can squeeze past that you can re-try floors as much as you want and 3-3 was comparatively really easy imo. Best of Luck!!
Genshin_Impact,"On the one hand I understand how you could think that given that your 3 5*s are 'supports' but... You can build those as damage. People main DPS Jean, Fisch, even Xiang all the time."
Genshin_Impact,"Charged normal-sword attacks also launch enemies, very helpful in 3-1 for launching the archers off and 3-2 for grouping up the knife throwers. Also don't worry about stars at all you just need to finish the floor in the the time limit. If it's damage holding you back and you're already level capped for whatever AR/World level you're at, try to get a few decent purple artifacts up to at least +8, spend a little get weapons up to level 20, etc. It makes a big difference."
JETProgramme,"I've done a decent amount of upgrading (bought a 3rd hand gaming rig a few years back, as well as a complete rework of a Thinkpad T440p for work/programming, now converting an old gaming laptop into a home server.) 

Prices out here aren't great, but it's not the end of the world. You can find some okay deals on used stuff, but for the most part amazon jp is sufficient. 

 I think for getting anything back home I'd probably do what other's have suggested and just keep the important parts in a carry on (in my case mobo/cpu is old enough where I'd probably just leave them and take hard drives/gpu back.)"
JETProgramme,"Also concerning ATMs: If you find yourself in a real tough spot and need to withdraw from a US account from an ATM but don't have the ~10,000 yen minimum for 7/11 ATMs, JP post bank will let you withdraw in 1000 yen increments."
JETProgramme,"Especially if you have older/unhealthy relatives. I didn't think much of it at the time but making a trip down to see my grandparents a few weeks before I shipped out here was the last time I will see either of them. Even if you think you'll be here for just a year or something, between travel instability, maybe deciding to re-contract, etc."
Genshin_Impact,"Also in the current co-op event! zipping up to the pillars to grab the blocks up there, or dropping the dagger in the collection zone, sprinting to a few blocks then blinking back is really fun."
japanlife,"It's been absolutely perfect this week. ~15 degrees, 秋晴れ, but still warm enough where you don't need to turn the stove on at night."
japanlife,"wait what? that's the standard pretty much everywhere, no? From AirBnBs to fancy-ass onsen resorts I don't think I've ever had checkout NOT be 10..."
GenshinGuild,"Well, it's been a few days and haven't heard back from anyone (main sub, tips sub, and Keqing Mains sub) so I guess for now the plan is to hold tight and see if any of them do... anything? While chiming in on the relevant meta threads on the main sub."
GenshinGuild,"Yeah, the artifact struggle in the low 30s has definitely sucked. I'm at the point where I have a few 5*s (from abyss, the geoculus puzzle, etc.) and a bunch of okay-ish purples. Opening the chests you get from abyss can help, and I've gotten some good purples/one gold from the weekly bosses. At this point I don't think domains for artifacts is a good use of resin compared to getting talent/weapon mats, or beating up the cubes for ascension materials (seeing as the next ascension needs at least a whole day's worth of resin for a single material.)"
Genshin_Impact,"I agree, I think having this kind of content here is fine, but having a dedicated guides/meta space, especially with the support and cooperation of the main sub's team would really help imo."
Genshin_Impact,"Yep. There are a few places/folks trying to make a more dedicated discussion place but they're kind of all over the place. (I've started r/GenshinGuild, however it's currently quite small.) Of all the things to crack down on here, it's kind of funny how text-based posts get the short end of the stick vs PaImOn FoOd or -this could easily get me fired- NSFW fanart that's a-okay. The Meme sub was a great first step, and the last few days HAVE been better, but it's definitely still a work in progress. 

Have tried reaching out to the mods of several subs such as here and /r/GenshinImpactTips about figuring out some kind of centralized discussion sub but it's been *crickets* thus far."
japanlife,"Ah I see, I'll look into it! Thanks"
japanlife,Does the A10 support setting a static DNS for pihole? Thinking of grabbing my own router as the shoddy combination modem/router I got from NTT doesn't seem to support it.
GenshinGuild,Yeah Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers is really good on swap-heavy teams. even after making the craftable catalyst I'm still using it on barbara.
GenshinGuild,"makes sense! the double electric synergy is really nice too, can basically ultimate on cooldown for Keqing."
GenshinGuild,"Yeah, I barely made it through 6 last night, didn't hit the needed 6 stars but mostly wanted the free 5* artifact from 6-3. Abyss 6 is where you start having to clear 20+ mobs with -both- teams."
GenshinGuild,"she's basically free lightning procs for everyone else. You generally swap to her, drop Oz (her raven) then swap to another character as he will stay out dealing constant lightning damage."
GenshinGuild,Wow! Abyss 5 with 9 stars is really impressive with saving a bunch of pulls. I burned all the way to the pity timer on the venti banner and am still struggling on it (think I need to spend some resources on Noelle so I can have an actual 2nd healer...)
GenshinGuild,"I think with them both at C1 I would definitely prefer Fischl as the main carry. Before I pulled Keqing last week Fischl was my main source of damage even with Xiangling having more constellation levels, as you want her on the field to make use of her C1 ability.

 Xiangling's constellation mostly revolves around the panda/her ultimate, and the lack of easily accessible spears makes having her as a main dps kind of rough. (by having her on support with the Halberd, you can swap her in every ~10ish seconds to drop the panda, use the enpowered auto-attack, then swap back to fischl.)"
JETProgramme,"said dream job was also in Japan, so trying to skip out on a bill from a town government/CLAIR would have been even more ill-advised."
JETProgramme,"I'd definitely second this. There's a ton of stories from JETs where it's gone the complete opposite of what they expected: People falling in love with their podunk inaka towns, or having an absolutely terrible time in the big city they really wanted."
GenshinGuild,Honestly that seems to be an issue for a lot of us who ended up getting venti on the pity timer. By the the time you've got him you're probably already pretty invested in whatever team you've been using to get the requisite primogems. For the time being I'm honestly just keeping mine at level 1 for mapping and the occasional CC in the 2 team sections of abyss.
JETProgramme,It's not a game I would play. A friend of mine did that (was offered basically their dream job after getting their placement) and ended up being on the hook for a pretty huge chunk of cash (over 3000 dollars iirc)
GenshinGuild,"Interesting, good to know! so in theory the electro charge damage should be the same from both charged shots and Oz's attacks?"
Genshin_Impact,"I like the idea of themed days/daily threads as many other gaming subs having. For example ff14's RAGE THREAD FRIDAYS are a great success. The gacha thread is a great example of this too. I think limiting art to a few days a week might seem a bit extreme, but on the flip side the current system just... is not working for a lot of us. There's a lot of great potential for scheduled weekly threads, between character discussions, lore discussions, *gacha RAGE* threads, etc. 

I think the greatest failing right now is it's really hard to find some of the great content/discussions/guides on the sub as they either get drowned out by the art, or get answered in the massive daily thread that seems to encompass 95% of questions. Hell, even this survey was unpinned for most of yesterday for the announcement of the co-op event.  This leads to people not being able to find the answer to what they're looking for efficiently, and so the same 5-10 questions get repeated ad naseum in the daily threads. 

To that end I would like to suggest having someone or a few folks dedicated to working on and fleshing out and updating the sub's wiki/sidebar to have more to do with gameplay. Currently we have: Meme page, ""In depth FAQ"" that has nothing to do with gameplay outside of the most basic ""this is what resin is."" and a few links to database pages/ the most recent megathreads. I'd love to see a curated list of some of the better guides, character guides, good content creators, and more in-depth gameplay info more readily available."
GenshinGuild,"Yeah, that would probably be for the best. 

After the initial announcement of the meme server by the main sub team I reached out to them to see if they had any ideas to make a meta/discussion focused sub, or if they wanted any help with the current one in terms of making guides/FAQ stuff a bit more accessible and never got a reply lol."
GenshinGuild,"Thanks! Listed the Quick TLDR set under general guides temporarily, will link each out individually in the wiki this afternoon."
GenshinGuild,"Awesome, thanks!"
GenshinGuild,"Not intentionally, no. To be perfectly honest I didn't know it existed when I started setting this up late last week. I'll reach out to them via modmail and see."
Genshin_Impact,"Hey there, I've started putting /r/GenshinGuild together for that exact purpose. Will be adding more guides//tools//hopefully dedicated daily/weekly threads within the next few days."
Genshin_Impact,"For support Favonius is actually pretty nice. Free 4*, and the effect works out nicely for a support build. Basically with another electro/swapping in for an occasional headshot it lets you keep Oz up most of the time even with the really long cooldown."
Genshin_Impact,"I use that same team, honestly probably not even going to sink the resources into Venti for now (have him at level 1 for mapping, mostly.)

 I would say if you're determined to use him probably barbara for the vast majority of content that you don't need a dedicated healer for (any overworld stuff you can just swap into her as needed.) For abyss/domains/bosses, probably swap out fischl or xiang depending on the elements involved (having both keq and fisch for anything involving those electro slimes is just suffering.)"
GenshinGuild,"That's a good question. I decided to try it out on one of the big ax goblins and here's what I can see: 

for 1: Order doesn't appear to matter, electro-charge did the same damage regardless of whether wet (Barbara auto) or electro (Fischl charged shot) hit first. 

for 2: I'm not sure, but I believe the damage of the attack matters, as electro charged appeared to do different damage based on what proc'd it (keqing ability vs electro-infused basic attack) 

for 3: If it scales off of the triggering attack as it seems from 2, I would imagine it would matter for oz. will edit this as soon as I find something I can test it on. **EDIT:** Just tried this with Barbara/Fish, didn't matter which was on the field, Oz's electro-charge procs hit for the same amount.

for 4: I don't think I've seen it crit, even with keqing with quite high crit chance."
Genshin_Impact,"for sustained DPS keqing, even at c0, has been a massive gain for my team. C2 fishcl went from my main damage dealer to bird machine, and same with c5 Xiang. between those 2 I have pretty much 100% uptime on The Lion's Roar on Keqing and she -shreds-"
Genshin_Impact,"AR18, the quest is called ""A Long Shot."" It's towards the end of the Mondstadt arc."
Genshin_Impact,Unity.
Genshin_Impact,"I'm pretty sure that they're unaffected by world level, so you might as well open them ASAP."
Genshin_Impact,"Hey folks, after seeing a lot of people ask for a dedicated meta space over the past week or so I've started /r/GenshinGuild to hopefully fill that role. Will be fleshing out a wiki/directory to worthwhile guides and tools over the next couple of days."
Genshin_Impact,"Guides on a per-character basis seem a bit scarce so far. For keqing in particular the keqing mains subreddit has a -really- good writeup [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeqingMains/comments/j6p4yu/how_to_build_the_cat_queen_part_3_accessorizing/)

Generally the genshin.gg builds aren't bad, per se, but they tend to be extremely basic and don't really go into substats."
GenshinGuild,"I'm currently using **Keqing, Xiangling, Fischl, and Barbara** as my main squad, with Keqing as my main carry and the rest as support (until something resistant to electric shows up.) 

General rotation is: Drop Oz, Drop Goubu, Swap to Barbara for healing ring and Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, then into Keqing for dps until it's time to refresh Oz and Goubu. Usually every 2 cycles or so of Goubu it's time to refresh Barbara's skill as well."

Genshin_Impact,"That's fair. I agree that splintering communities isn't always ideal, but the current state of this main subreddit leaves a lot to be desired. Thank you for the filtered link though, as it's quite handy! 

 I actually originally abandoned the idea last week after seeing the creation of the dedicated meme sub by the modteam, but since then it's seemingly been nothing but artwork/slightly-less-shitposty memes, with the daily thread generally consisting of the same few questions that should be in a FAQ by now.

 I wasn't aware of the existence of r/GenshinImpactTips however, and will check it out."
Genshin_Impact,"Good point. Self-posts can still have images in the body of the post, however. It would mostly be a deterrent for memes/fanart/youtube spam. Once things are more situated we could look into allowing links as well, as it's just a toggle in the subreddit settings."
Genshin_Impact,"I started putting one together last week, only to see the modpost about the meme sub. I had hoped that would be enough but as that isn't the case I'll probably spend some time this week putting a meta/self-post only sub together. I tried mailing the modteam to see if they had any interest in officially making something like that but got no reply, so I'm just going to go ahead and keep making one.

Edit: I'll be working on it more this evening, but for now the subreddit is live at r/GenshinGuild. Hope to see you there!"

JETProgramme,"They're super handy, as well as other 100 yen shops. You can get a lot of basic stuff like stationary, cutlery, house cleaning supplies and the like there. I typically do most of my seasonal shopping there (halloween plates for eikaiwa halloween parties, christmas stickers for worksheets, etc.) 

Recycle shops aren't terribly uncommon, as far as I know. Usually any small or medium sized city should have at least one or two. My town doesn't have one as far as I know, but the nearby city (40ish minute drive) has a good... 7 or 8 of them. As far as chains to look for: HardOff (heh)/Offhouse (same company as Book Off), and up north we have Oki Doki."
JETProgramme,"Yeah, also if you DO come and have to basically start from scratch, buy used! Recycle shops out here are infinitely more useful than rummaging through salvation army back home. Nice cups for 100, A perfectly functional kotatsu for 2000, lights, appliances, hell my friend even bought a bedframe from one on the cheap."
JETProgramme,"Ah sorry I should have clarified: this was normal Japanese income tax from a few years back. Due to some IRS issues back home I couldn't get the paperwork for the tax treaty stuff, and had to pay up.

 Residence tax is definitely something to consider as well, although I've been paying that every year on time."
JETProgramme,"To add on a bit for shoes: For dudes you can pretty consistently find up to around 27.5cm (9.5 in US size). Anything larger than that and you'll be looking at ordering online/some big and tall stores. 

Clothing can be rough, but many retailers have some extended sizes online. I'm pretty hefty and am able to make do with uniqlo's online selection for a lot of things. I've heard of some folks importing from the US but shipping can get out of hand pretty quickly."
JETProgramme,"This is slightly embarrassing, and seems obvious but: **Make sure your CO doesn't fuck up your taxes out here.** After years of them having JETs who were exempt under the US tax treaty (which is gone now, I think?) I was one of the only ones they've had who didn't qualify for it. Longer story short I got hit with about 3 years worth of taxes out of the blue for a grand total bill of roughly 300,000 yen - more than our monthly take home salary. I was able to work it out over a month or two but it was incredibly stressful and upsetting. 

Also money related: learn to budget, or grab some budgeting software and stick with it from the get go. I wasted 2 years out here blowing most of my paycheck on stupid shit before grabbing YNAB, and am kicking myself for not starting saving sooner."
ModSupport,"Would this not seriously hinder posts where the OP explains the post in further detail in a parent comment? 

OP posts -> Comments details -> first 25-50 comments go ABOVE the explanation until whatever triggers the post to revert to sort by best. 

Brilliant, really. I especially like the ""good catch"" like y'all got caught with your hand in the cookie jar. How many unannounced sub-breaking ""haHAA sorry guys just testing~"" incidents is this now?"
Genshin_Impact,"Been seeing a lot of asking for this kind of thing the past few days, might try putting one together over the weekend."
japanlife,Definitely not if you're looking for affordable. 4k projectors are still well into the thousands.
Genshin_Impact,"I would keep it. I'm using basically that team with a few more constellation levels (AR23 with 2 Fischl, 4 Xiangling, 1 Chongyun, and 5 Barbera) and have had 0 issues from the get go, even without the dupes."
Genshin_Impact,"I use Chongyun, Barbara, Fischl, and Xiangling and it works great. Basically I start by dropping Oz, quickly swap to Chongyun to drop the ice field, Barbara for the water/healing aura, then finally Xiangling for damage. Since spear attacks proc Chongyun's ice circle it basically turns into a massive damage dump of Water/Ice freezing, then getting melted or superconducted by Oz/Guoba. 

Other benefits include: Incredibly easy to deal with flying enemies as oz/barbara alone typically 2 shot them with the free electro-charge procs. Freeze-locking obnoxious enemies with Barb+Chongyun, or using it to stall for longer cooldowns like Oz or the debuff from the water domain. 

Pretty much all of them can be set up as your main damage carry depending on what weapons/artifacts you get. I'm sticking with Xiang for now as I have her at C3 with a lot of attack and crit artifacts. Fish with the headshot bow can clear camps without every getting close, and I have Chongyun using The Bell right now to work as a pseudo-tank."
Genshin_Impact,"The FAQ should absolutely be updated with this info and pinned. It won't stop the daily questions getting clogged with the same 3 questions, but it should help a bit."
japanlife,"Yeah, I understand not allowing people to charge up/use it for the time being, but how the hell are you supposed to know if your balance ON the card got swiped if everything is shut down/errored out? Yeah it's easy to tell if someone drained your actual bank account but... come on now."

Genshin_Impact,"Damage from passing her ability to Xiang or Chong. With timing you can basically have 100% uptime on elemental reactions, or if you have a damage window on bigger/annoying enemies you dump all of them and have constant fire/water/ice/electric going off at the same time."
Genshin_Impact,"Hit AR 20 before 1.1. She also shows up in the venti banner quite a bit (up to 4 copies, AR23.)"
Genshin_Impact,"Fish is A, Oz is S++. She can be invaluable when you need an archer, but really just crazy combos with Oz, Xing, Chong, and Barb are where the damage comes from, in my experience."
japanlife,"Looks like they've shut down the entire server for the time being, can't access anything on the app at all."
Genshin_Impact,"I have a similar comp/pulls I've been using (Chong, Barb, Fish, Xing.) I think if you wanted to go no healer swapped barb for Beidou might be the play, as the double electro bonus is apparently pretty good."
Genshin_Impact,"I'm not sure, but have you been using the US account to play? In theory that should be all that matters as it's tied to your psn. You can try it out, then if it doesn't work look into workarounds for paying on your HK account, such as prepaid codes online."
Genshin_Impact,"It's story related, you'll get there eventually. And yeah, just doing as much of the story as you can while adventuring around is the way to go."
Genshin_Impact,"Double check the area, every shamrock I've hit has been an air current nearby."
Genshin_Impact,"Currently rocking that with Choung instead of MC and it's working very well for me. Between the raven, tanuki, and barb's water ring getting passed along it's pretty constant procs. Gave choung a max refined sword of the one that does bonus damage to electro/on fire enemies."

CompetitiveTFT,"Doesn't even necessarily have to be kindred, tbh. I've tried a good bit of both going for 8 with brawler chosen and just going 6 brawlers + whatever and once you have your 6 brawlers going you can carry with a lot of the 3 cost units for a bit. I like lux as good positioning with her will let her easily stun and take a massive chunk out of the entire enemy team (especially if they just do your typical pre-rolldown stack everyone in one corner thing.)"
JETProgramme,"I'm guessing it has to do with them still sorting out how they're going to ration out the handful of folks from safe(r) countries who they can actually get here.

CompetitiveTFT,"Yep, just got home and am trying to connect in JP. Someone in the discord was mentioning similar problems. Something seems to have gotten borked... right at the last day or so of PBE as well... wonderful."
CompetitiveTFT,"They're incredibly difficult to pull off, and unlike most of the other ""chase"" 9 traits you absolutely still need some specific items to make it with them. They still lose out to a lot of the other full build traits (sharpshooter, shade, warlord) because it's very hard to keep the few relevant damage mages alive long enough in late game scenarios. 

The one time I pulled it off I went out in 3rd with a stacked 3* Annie, 3* mage thresh, and 10 mages overall (2nd cap was on Janna for a bit more shield/enlightened.) the 2 comps above were 9 warlords with I think garen as the only 3*, and 4shade/4assassin with a stacked zed 3* and pyke 3*"
CompetitiveTFT,"seriously, having him just stroll on up and decimate a 3* hecarim with 6 vanguards in all of 2 seconds is depressing. Why bother with tank builds even?"
CompetitiveTFT,"1 ninja + assassin or shade just hurts a ton. Having a 1 star itemless zed stroll up to 2* 3 costs and kill them in 2-3 hits sucks big time.

I've been having fun with going for various chase builds, namely 8 brawlers + whatever you decide on for a carry.

 Also, I'm (only slightly ironically) really into Tahm Kench builds. by -super- slow rolling (almost to the point of open forting) you can guarantee the 3* and usually a spat, then work towards whatever crazy unkillable frog combo you can think of. My two favorites so far have been assassin with IE/Deathcap, and Divine/6 dusk/BV kench. Assassin in particular got top 4, and while I think I'd swap IE for FH, it's actually incredibly good if you scout. Shoving a huge, nearly undamagable tank in front of your enemies aphelios/ashe/nidalee etc mitigates a massive amount of damage while your other brawlers/dps clean up."
CompetitiveTFT,"If you have a bunch of tanks, shove the unimportant ones in the back as bait. Most dps traits also have at least 1 unit with a bit of built in defense: kindreds jump, nami nearly instantly bubbling at start of round, jax's spin, etc. I think between assassins actually being viable this set and how much easier 3*s have become positioning is gonna be really important this time around."
CompetitiveTFT,"Early chosen warlord is great, imo. I don't think it's worth pursuing hard without getting what you need to chase 9 though. No chosen/get to stage 5 with no spat? probably abandon the 9x dream and go for a good 4 star carry like riven so you can have 6x/dusk/keeper/vanguard all going for at least a bit of synergy."
CompetitiveTFT,"One of my favorites is chosen kindred in level 6-7, if you happen to get a warwick can get the 2 hunter, if you have mystic in from something like shen or janna can go for mystic+spirit, plus they slap quite a bit on their own."
CompetitiveTFT,"There does seem to be a few low cost things that could really use a little scaling down. Stuff like Aphelios, Zed, and yasuo being able to carry well into stage 4-5 combined with chosen can feel real bad."
CompetitiveTFT,"there's still some  weirdness with her visual effects too with the 2nd cast, there are times I've popped ga off the opponents between the two casts, only for the 2nd one to go off while GA is proccing."
CompetitiveTFT,This is super useful! Thank you!
CompetitiveTFT,What items do you go for on vayne? Honestly I think early game is slow enough where you could even slowroll on level 5 for a lot of things. I've done a lot of similar starts mostly for memeing with tahm kench and once you hit the 3 stars it's usually smooth sailing to level 8.

TeamfightTactics,Yeah after further experimentation there's quite a lot of hilarious ways to make him nigh invincible. Best I've gotten so far was 6 dusk with spat on him + divine sword + I think... TR? with 2 chalices next to him.
CompetitiveTFT,"Well, specifically with forcing kench you more or less int. You want lots of gold to be able to slow roll on 5, and that means spending no gold. I'll only buy relevant units unless I get a really good chosen early, and basically ride the loss streak until 1st/2nd sometimes even 3rd carousel, so if a spat shows up there you typically have first dibs. The divine one was luck as the 4th or 5th stage one had it pre-built and no one wanted it."
CompetitiveTFT,I feel like day 1 people were mentioning Yone likes to target them with his ultimate as well.
CompetitiveTFT,"I think it's more of a problem with Aphelios, but I agree that Jhin is incredibly underwhelming at 4. Pyke can at least be a CC machine."
CompetitiveTFT,Finding and reporting bugs sure. Intentionally abusing bugs game after game absolutely screws up data for the normal gameplay loop and devalues the experience as a whole.
CompetitiveTFT,"Here's what I found forcing a few brawler games, I'm planning on doing a lot more later today so can keep you posted but: 

As far as chosen goes, I think early if you get a tank chosen (garen, especially) you can get away with that as your frontline and sprinkle whatever 2 unit offensive trait you find, or whatever you can 2*. For forcing brawlers I actually actively ignore tank chosen so I can get a decent dps one to sit behind 2 brawlers, and then eventually 4 at level 5. If it's something that has 0 synergy and is falling off (such as dazzler lis/warlord nid/duelist Fiora) I'll try to sell them around 3-2/3-3 to slot in a 3 cost with better offense until a good 2/3/4 cost chosen shows up."
CompetitiveTFT,Absolutely. He scales off of AP as well and his numbers are close enough that with the right itemization early you can build some serious advantage early game. One of my games forcing him last night I was able to get 2 Chalices on a kennan next to a 2* kench and that alone was enough to make the vast majority of 1 cost 2* dps deal 0 damage to him. Seeing him slowly waddle on over and slap the shade out of a 1* zed with IE and RFC was absolutely hilarious.
CompetitiveTFT,A similar bug that's come up a few times: If you're fighting the ghost of a cultist player sometimes their Galio won't show up at all making it a pretty easy win.
CompetitiveTFT,"Yep, happened to me over the weekend and put in a report for it."
CompetitiveTFT,"I don't know if it helps much, but I've been reporting every player I see abuse it. Hopefully they'll at least get their PBE accounts yoinked."
CompetitiveTFT,"Kench has some of the best meme potential. I spent a few hours yesterday working out Dusk Kench with a few people on the discord and on my final game of the night was able to get Divine/Dusk/TR on a 3 star kench with 6 dusk and boy, could that frog tank some serious abuse. Will have to try elderwood tonight but honestly I think a lot of folks are sleeping on brawler starts."
CompetitiveTFT,It's exactly what it looks like. Live attempt at making TK dusk so he scales massively and takes little-to-no damage. Thanks to DarthNutella in the TFT discord for helping with the build idea.
TeamfightTactics,It's exactly what it looks like. Live attempt at making TK dusk so he scales massively and takes little-to-no damage. Thanks to DarthNutella in the TFT discord for helping with the build idea.
CompetitiveTFT,"Basically it's just abusing a bug because in their infinite wisdom they mentioned it on stream. 3 cultists + 4 spirits causes some units to gain ridiculous attack speed, apparently zed being one of them, so you just slap a RFC on him and he will 1v9."
CompetitiveTFT,"""Fuck this shit I'm out, mmhmmm"""
CompetitiveTFT,"I've found the 6 chrono variant of cybers to work pretty well against them. having Ezreal and eventually Mana Reaver with thresh/Irelia slows down the onslaught a bit, and itemized Lucian + 4 chronos is usually enough to kill off the problematic SGs before they get too out of hand."
CompetitiveTFT,"I agree but I kind of like it? Making it so you don't just hyperroll on 3-2 hit a few 3 costs and afk for 20 minutes is good imo. Make it good enough where it's worth going for, but not so good that it's just a free top 4."

CompetitiveTFT,"Hey there, I finally made the climb to diamond IV 0 LP after a week or too between plat 1-3. Here's a few things that -really- helped, at least with the builds I was going for. 

* Build a tank item first. Yes, in a perfect world you'd love to get blue buff squared away early for Teemo or Syndra, or IE for Jhin, etc. but slamming an early warmogs on any 2* frontliner will go a long way to making sure you either winstreak with whatever random damage you have, or take little enough damage that it doesn't matter (I feel like JinxexJK talked about this a bit in his recent protectors video.)
* Choosing to hold or pivot before you get yourself in a hole. I talked about it a bit [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/ii7o4z/august_28_2020_daily_discussion_thread /g36ux0w/) a few days ago. Even though I had a great looking prot/SG start, I realized in early Stage 3 that 3 people were already going for SG and decided to bail into chrono+whatever I got. Having a few off-meta builds you can shift to if you don't hit items/are having multiple people handhold your units can make a big difference. 
* This is pretty close to #1 but really important for ""strongest board"" play in the first couple of stages. Priority, at least for me, looks like 2*>> FRONTLINE >>>> at least 1 damage dealer >>>>>> early eco. Having something like 4 early vanguards/brawlers/protectors with some kind of damage will help massively in the early game. Hold pairs, keep an eye on what frontline your opponents are using and what you're getting, slam a warmogs or Ionic on a frontliner. 

I might add more as I think of them, but hopefully that helps a little. Best of luck!"

Had a good start to my day today. Was initially bothered as I got a warmongs and Rakan 2 early only to see 3 other people going protector/SGs, but ended up with an early TF 2 and Riven and decided to just... play what I got. Ended up being very close as the BM player popped off, and the GP had an almost unwinnable board ( 2* GP with GA and double JG, Darius next to him with double chalice, etc.) but someone else managed to take him out."
japanlife,"Python, C++ just wasn't working for us..."
japanlife,"that 2nd to last one has been kicking my ass lately. multiple nights in a row of 100% humidity and high temps, and far enough north where AC really isn't a thing at all and my shitty 3000 yen fan isn't cutting it. This summer has been the worst here by far..."
japanlife,Yeah I found even if I wasn't tearing my entire house down and meticulously getting rid of everything just going a category or two now and again is pretty useful. Especially for stuff like clothes when you realize you have a decent pile of stuff you never bother wearing.
japanlife,"Yeah that's definitely more of the making a buck off her image stuff. Ironically a lot of the first book is her talking about how buying stuff to store your crap is the complete wrong way to go about it and how she fell into that trap for a lot of her life lmao.

japanlife,Her whole schtick is throwing away crap though?
CompetitiveTFT,"I'll second the level 8 comps. Astro Snipers in particular since you could still use SG as an opener with syndra or ahri holding your teemo items, neeko or poppy holding you eventual gnar/wukong stuff, etc."
CompetitiveTFT,"me: puts HOJ and TR on mech -> get shredded like tissue paper, ults single unit in the corner, rumble dies the instant he leaves mech.

opponent: puts HOJ and TR on mech -> 1 v 8s all the lads, if you happen to beat the initial mech rumble just stunlocks/roasts the squad."
CompetitiveTFT,"Maybe try to keep an eye on where you're losing a lot of health? It sounds silly to say but lately I've had a rough go of it too and realized it's mostly waiting too long to push 8-9 or roll down. 

Have had multiple games where I can be in the 80s or even 90s for hp until late stage 4, then everyone else rolls down and hits final comps while I slow roll or level for my last few units and it just becomes a string of 20 damage losses to death.

Sometimes depending on the build/galaxy it's the opposite issue. Can't get a good stage 2/3 board going and instead of spending a little gold to stabilize, just get chunked down to 30-40 by stage 4, so even if I stabilize I'm 1-2 losses away from bottom 4-ing."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
CompetitiveTFT,"Absolutely. Vest at least has -some- viability between TR on mech and GA on shaco/jhin etc, but wait! those need the 2 most in-demand offensive items. Cloak in particular is just... awful."
CompetitiveTFT,"Even component items are just so inherently tiered. Just went from 1st to 8th in a game because I got, in total: 3 chainvests, a portal from inital mortdog carousel, 2 tears which were slammed early for bluebuff (was on SG most of the game) 3-4 cloaks, and 2 bows. 0 rods, 0 swords, 0 gloves. Game over."
CompetitiveTFT,It is a bit unfortunate how even the 4 mystic variant still just gets slammed by an itemized syndra/viktor/gp.
TeamfightTactics,I just wanted you to know that this guide is good enough for reddit to decide to email me about it.
CompetitiveTFT,"Yeah, I think I made the wrong call by tunneling on Irelia as a secondary carry as she had infil/GA/cap, so I had a riven in as #9 instead to get BM as well."
CompetitiveTFT,IE/LW/GS. I have a feeling not forcing urgot was my downfall
CompetitiveTFT,Absolutely. I'm super glad it's the patch we'll be on for worlds
CompetitiveTFT,"It feels like a lot of this set has evolved into this extremely interesting meta where most wins you either go hard early with something like shredder, TF carry smorgashboard, or space jam, or you manage to survive long enough to get one of the ""you actually can't win against this"" comps going like peeba, mech + shaco or victor carry, GP nuking the entire field from orbit, etc."
CompetitiveTFT,"""Yeah mech's nerfed it's dead. Just build a GS and it's easy.""

*takes 4th using fully itemized vayne, 6 cyber, infil/GA irelia, level 2 riven for BM to boot* 

1st and 2nd are handholding mechs with HOJ and BV

Sure glad the comp doesn't exist anymore."
CompetitiveTFT,"I find you need to be a lot more aggressive about slamming items/units in these. Almost any game with the ""highroll"" stuff will have at least 1 person doing some incredibly degenerate early game shit that will chunk out life, whether it's shredder, GA/JG Darius, early stacked shaco, etc."
CompetitiveTFT,"Oh for sure. Honestly in cybers I feel like I'd usually hold the vest for a GA anyway, unless it's worth slamming BV in a lobby of bangbros holding each other swords, etc."
CompetitiveTFT,"It's a weird one, I feel like I've seen it both absolutely dominate games, and peter out in top 8. 2* Shaco with GA/BT is absolutely abusive. I think the 2 pronged approach of having snipers blowing up the frontline and shaco/fizz eating away at the backline just seems to get there a lot of the time. It tends to clump up the opposing team as well, letting Rakan get tons of value."
CompetitiveTFT,"It seems to take MMR a bit to catch up sometimes? I cruised up to plat 3 on a hot streak and most of the time was like, the only silver in a lobby of plat, or only gold in a lobby of diamond, etc. Been bouncing back and forth between plat 3-2 the past few days and seems to have finally leveled out the MMR as well."
CompetitiveTFT,"feels absolutely awful. I think the 'justification' (I detest it as well tbh just playing devil's advocate) is that if you aren't playing a strong board, you usually don't get the GP rolling until you're pretty low on HP. not to mention 4 rods and a GA is already pretty damn lucky as far as items go."
CompetitiveTFT,Congrats!
CompetitiveTFT,"Cybernetics, maybe? try to soup up a lucian with red-buff/another blaster and either slowroll for the 3* or level normally and swap him out for an Ekko"
CompetitiveTFT,"happens a lot, and it sucks because if you have high ping by the time the last items are revealed you have no time to reposition if it's something you need."
CompetitiveTFT,yep! was posted about here: https://old.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveTFT/comments/id2caa/mech_hot_fix_to_go_live_tomorrow/ pretty big nerfs
CompetitiveTFT,Hopefully that hotfix announced for tomorrow knocks 'em down a couple pegs.
CompetitiveTFT,"Absolutely agree, seeing stuff from early 4 celestials, infil spats on pretty much anyone, holding them for the potential FoN, etc. Really nice galaxy imo"
CompetitiveTFT,last night I definitely noticed an uptick in load-in time for games/other players instantly DC'ing. Haven't noticed anything on my end specifically but
CompetitiveTFT,Absolutely. If you have an abundance of swords the standard 2* Shaco with GA + BT can absolutely wreak havock on backlines/clean up whatever the mech doesn't. Scouting becomes pretty important but I've lost quite a few rounds vs mech to shaco going off while my dps just focus the mech.
japanlife,I've found they REALLY like the heat my car puts off when I run the AC. Pretty unsettling having them riding on my mirrors at stoplights.
japanlife,"Mochi icecream is great, one of those 2 packs is like 160ish calories?"
CompetitiveTFT,"The same, the Titan's """"""nerf"""""" is much more of a buff. You can use it on other tanks as well now, and while the damage is lower, they hit max stacks incredibly quickly."
CompetitiveTFT,"I don't remember where I read this, but I feel like I saw someone saying if you have a good unit to add and leveling isn't going to cost you more than 1 gold in eco, might as well go for it unless you're lose streaking. 

The potential gain of winning a round because you leveled/maintaining or starting a streak can outweigh that small set back. Been trying it a bit lately and I think it's sound advice. Even if you don't win the round you level on, you've probably saved at least a couple of HP for 1 gold, which in the current meta can be really important. Stuff like hyperolled 3 stars, early mechs, static shiv battlecaster, etc. can knock off a lot of HP even in earlier rounds."
CompetitiveTFT,"especially if they handhold 3 of the top 4 spots. Usually it's something like one or two on them hit the build proper and are top 2, and the others fall off sometime in R4/5, but now and again it's each 3/4 of them sitting pretty with 2* pilots and either blue buff victor, GA gangplank, or Shojin/Rageblade lets-turn-this-into-Kansas Janna."

pathofexile,"I have suspicions about it being RAM related as well. I got slightly better performance by having literally everything else shut off (no firefox on monitor 2, no PoB, trade macro, wallpaper engine, nothing.) RAM usage seems ridiculously high.

Unfortunately still getting the massive spikes of latency/0fps popping harvest mobs or during certain maps. At this point I'm running settings at magnitudes lower than what my system should be capable of/defaults"

The situation of the world at large isn't helping a whole lot."
pathofexile,It's been just as bad over on the JP gateway for me. Somehow I got a (very slightly) more stable experience with 150+ ping on California's gateway.
pathofexile,"Absolutely the same problem. I shut all my settings down to the lowest, lowered resolution a bit, tried both vulkan and dx11, and there's still times where it all just stutters and freezes up. Highest latency spike I've seen is 7000ms. I've had longer, but those almost always result in a DC/full crash to desktop.

 I've actually stopped doing the harvest mechanic alltogether for the time being, as the game literally freezes until either my minions kill the spawns, or I die (usually the latter.) My PC isn't the greatest in the world, but can run much more demanding games on much better settings. (mostly high on Far Cry 5, maxed out + beefy ReShade on FF14, etc.) 

Something about minions spawning in seems to be a trigger, as things like harvesting crops, syndicate encounters and popping monoliths almost always result in a lock-up or death."

 I was initially a little disappointed that I wasn't placed closer to Sapporo, but I still end up there a few times a year for SDC/other events. It's been a while so I don't quite remember all of my expectations, but for the most part I don't think I was too surprised or caught off guard with anything out here.

JETProgramme,"Generally speaking hair is one of the things you can get away with to a point. I came with medium hair and a bit of facial hair, now have pretty long hair and a full beard. Occasionally a teacher or friend will ask why, or the younger kids will be amazed by the beard, but never from a place of malice or being told ""you need to cut your hair/beard!!!"""
JETProgramme,"Ahh gotcha, my bad! Yeah it's kind of crazy some of the stuff you find. I found a care package box/some stuff from my like.... great-great-great-...great? Pred. Far enough back where only one person in my BoE even remembered the name."
JETProgramme,"My pred was super nice! He and his wife (one of the nurses at one of  our schools) took me out to dinner my first night and told me a lot about the area, job, etc. He was also around for my first official day at the office to walk me through some of the day to day stuff like stamping the attendance book, signing out the town hall cars, and all that good stuff. Gave me a rundown of the various teachers as well, without being overly judgemental about them (so-and-so can be a little strict, this teacher knows no English so will rely on you doing most everything, etc.) 

They cleaned the apartment really well, left a bottle of wine and some Strong Zeros in the fridge, and also left a ton of useful stuff for me to use. I eventually ended up getting rid of some of it, but it really helped not having to worry about home life for the first few months. 

My co-worker who came a week after me, on the other hand, kind of got the short end of the stick. His pred, while not necessarily a bad dude, comparatively did not have his shit together at all. I met him as our bosses were sternly reminding him he was supposed to be out a day or two ago, while the apartment was in tatters and he and his uh... -slightly- agitated significant other were loading up a big truck with his stuff (he only moved an hour or so away.) 

Didn't leave any info, barely had contact, and our BoE staff (bless them) had to spend 3-4 days deep cleaning the apartment after he left late. He wasn't bad at the job or anything, they kept him for 5 years after all, he was just kind of hard to work with."
JETProgramme,"I forget, so sorry if I'm mistaken but you're heading home this year right? If you were staying longer I'd say go full Marie Kondo on that shit. My pred left a lot of really useful stuff, but also a decent amount of things I have 0 use for. Finally sat down last year and did a fairly large cleaning involving taking everything out, deciding what I needed/wanted, and tossing the rest."
JETProgramme,"New textbook is alright, but does have some pacing issues IMO (using One World Smiles.) Personally my workload has gone down, as the increase in hours convinced my BoE to hire a dedicated ES JTE for a year. He's been great, and is super into being T1/prepping whenever or whatever he can. For the first time since coming here I actually feel like an assistant instead of the main teacher. 

 Back to the books though. My biggest gripe is on the publisher side, as they've made getting the digital textbook a colossal pain in the ass unless your BoE forks over 80,000+ yen PER SCHOOL for licensing. Been on my textbook dept's case for months trying to get a single license for me and/or my JTE and they literally can't seem to figure out how to buy one. In the meanwhile we've lost at least an hour of classtime overall to having to hunt down/hook up shitty old CD players/DVD players, figuring out which track is where, etc."
SampleBattle,I dig the detuning of it! nice flip!

japanlife,"It's a great game! At first I wasn't crazy about the districts system but... definitely has grown on me. Great way to make a weekend disappear, just play a ""standard"" game in one sitting!"
SampleBattle,"Nice! I like the chorus voice. I think the pulsating synth might be a bit loud, kinda drowns out the drums and definitely buries the sample a lot."
SampleBattle,"I think you might've lopped off a bit too much of the bottom end. hard cut at 60 seems a bit high imo. Nice flip though! 

I guess in general for 808s I usually

* Keep it mono
* Use nice headphones to mix but check on speakers just in case (I also don't have a sub for my speakers)
* Make sure to put a high-pass on pretty much everything else, including kicks (somewhere around 45ishHz usually?)
* side-chain to the kick, usually not too aggressively."
