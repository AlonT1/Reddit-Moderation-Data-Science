Dumb move was to goof around with your call for examples and change some words for my reply.   Which, by the way you failed to mention in your poll post.

You poll is flawed anyway - people can post highlights and the front page of this sub is half highlights.  The highlight policy simply limits the amount and type of highlights.

Hey, that's fair.  It is something we have been working on improving.   XFL is expressly not allowed by rules.  It is (NOT WAS) a whole differently league.  They have a great sub.

This is 10000000000000% false.  There was a thread, it blew up and had everything in it.  People were reposting the same stuff about the booing (well into the night) and we removed reposts like we always have.   That initial post was eventually locked bc people (most of whom never used the sub before last night) came in dropping racist garbage.   The post was up tho and we still removed reposts.   

This is very standard across Reddit.  Nothing specific to r/NFL at all.

Then Andy Reid commented on it and that went up bc it is not a repost, but a new thing about the booing.

Then Watt said something, and hey, not a repost, so it also was posted and was fine.

People losing their minds over reposts being removed is a new one for us."

Good thing that doesn't actually happen.   I think I saw one modmail where a user was asked to write something out because they were on their second or third perma ban.

As for ""words they don't like"" - that would be homophobic/racial/disability slurs.  We have rules for a reason and when someone calls another user a ""_______"" (fill in a slur there) and gets a temporary time out for it, they use that excuse in modmail (""sorry you were offended"" or ""so soft"").

nfl,"Look, don't make me defend the Colts of all teams.

They left in the middle of the night because the city passed legislation so they could seize the team using that ""eminent domain"" BS.  Irsay was a piece of shit, no doubt, but I can't fault him for bolting with his team like that.

Yeah he wanted a stadium and they wouldn't build it.  They wanted to snag the team so they couldn't leave either.   He also flirted with other cities besides indy."
