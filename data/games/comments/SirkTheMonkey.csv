The subreddit rules were adjusted recently and a Rule 5 comment is now mandatory.

SWN,"> sandthrowers are highly effective against lightly-armored fighters.

I'd argue that the Strike Fighter hull is modestly-armoured rather than lightly. To use a Star Wars analogy, a X-Wing would be a strike fighter whereas a TIE would have lower armour.

And even so, if you hit a strike fighter with a sandthrower you've got about a 60% of punching through the armour and doing at least 1HP damage. It's low but relatively reliable damage for something that's roughly the pistol equivalent for flak weapons in this system."

SWN,If you're just after the PDF or a print-on-demand then it'll be available once the design is done (almost certainly through drivethrurpg). If you're after the fancy offset-print book then I believe Mr Crawford has said that he'll have extra copies for sale from him via Amazon or similar once its all done and he's sent out claimed copies to campaign backers.

SWN,"SWN and Mr Crawford's other derived works are a fantastic chassis for genre treatments that are designed to be broad and accessible because it does enough for most games without doing too much extra. As GMs familiar with the system, it can be easier to bodge together our own implementation of a different setting/theme using it as a base rather than going through all the rigmarole of learning a new systems with all their potential complexities and differences in the basic elements.

However, we should still look at what other systems have to offer because there's plenty of space out there for unique and novel treatments of genres and themes. You referenced the FFG Star Wars games - I have some friends who rave about that system purely because of the very different dice / resolution mechanics. That is something that would be practically impossible to implement within an SWN-based framework because of how critical the 2d6/d20 resolution system is to the overall balance."

SWN,"Usually in my campaigns I let players roll three arrays and choose one whole array and I haven't changed that for SWN, although as a concession to this system I follow the rest of its rules with the rolls being 3d6 and no rearrangement. In other systems it usually let player choose between arrays with high highs and low lows or a generally above average result but with SWN it means the player usually gets a set of rolls that matches what they wanted to play (or they can dump the idea they came to the table with and grab an array that rolled surprisingly well)."

SWN,"Consider a planet was one giant 'ocean' of sand, one that is effectively a desert for humans but an ocean for the native life (and those humans who adapt to it). The ecosystem would be weird and alien and treat the sand in a way similar to water on Earth. Fine sand that flows around like our currents. Creatures 'swimming' through the sand and somehow breaking it down for their equivalent of air. Titanic lifeforms that totally aren't ripping off Dune."
SWN,"Pretty much.

Your players will usually decide what plots to follow (""Remember to always ask the group OOC what they want to do next"") and you can't guarantee that they'll latch onto what you might have planned as the main recurring plotline. On the other hand, your players might decide to keep exploring some other aspect and the game could end up with a long-running narrative on a different theme. You need to stay nimble with your plots and be prepared to just adjust or even throwaway your plans based on what the group chooses to do."

SWN,"One of my big learnings as I started with the system was giving up trying to push plots / storylines along. Think of this game as the more old-fashioned Monster/Story Of The Week TV shows rather than something more serialised. You can of course have elements return (example if the players annoy an authority figure, that figure might pop-up again as a problem in an otherwise unrelated later story).

That said, you can get big slow-moving background stories going with the Faction System. It's a good way to represent slow-brewing or expansive plots like a war between major entities or megacorporation rivalries."
victoria2,"`SOLDIER_TO_POP_DAMAGE = 0.2` in common\defines.lua

Yeah, there are five inventions that give a 1% improvement. Although I'd be curious to know if Rebels get the benefit of inventions due to TAG workaround shenanigans."
SWN,"Make sure your group is interested in the kind of sci-fi you're trying. There's no use building a fun setting about merchant pilots scraping a living hauling goods between isolated settlements when the players want a game about two titanic factions fighting it out across a packed sector. You'll also want to establish early if the campaign is going to have a specialist theme from one of the supplement books (space navy, spies, business/merchant, planetary military) and if outright magic from the Codex is going to be involved.

Build your sector using the rules in the book. Resist the temptation to adjust your rolls on the fly. Some rolls will seem bad for various reasons - it could be a seemingly-stupid combination of results (robots on a stone age world, a population of a billion on a world with a destructive atmosphere), a roll could be too similar to another roll you ended up with previously (rolling the Prison Planet tag on three different worlds), or the results might not match the kind of campaign you were thinking of doing (rolling many tech 4+ or tech 5 worlds when you were planning the sector to be quite primitive). Finish the process first and try to brainstorm ways to make it fit or adjust your goal to fit the rolls. Only if that doesn't pan out should you start adjusting the results.

SWN is designed as a sandbox and that's what it's best played as. A group that's Level 1 can easily find themselves fighting enemies that are way too powerful for them to beat, and a group that's Level 8 should be allowed to mop up groups of basic mooks (but remember that those mooks can still be armed with cheap auto-firing laser rifles which can still do serious damage with a lucky dice roll). Adjust the challenges to fit the story, not some perceived sense of balance with the players. The players ought to end up providing some balance themselves by setting out on challenges which they are capable of doing but ones with a good reward which implies plenty of risk.

Remember to always ask the group OOC what they want to do next when you finish an adventure. Don't leave it until between games in a Discord/Messenger/whatever conversation - ask while everyone is still engaged in the game."

Casualties inflicted when you attack rebel units is applied to the POPs that the spawned from, just as casualties against regular units are applied against the soldier POPs that they are made from. In vanilla this rate is 20%, so every 10 deaths in a unit removes 2 from the associated POP."

paradoxplaza,Consider that these kinds of surveys get responses from the hardcore fans and the hardcore Paradox fans have historically preferred simulationist systems. I'm sure Paradox are aware of this bias internally.
paradoxplaza,The key issue is that the old games are designed to run on a different operating system to iOS (or Android) devices. They'd need to redo the game code and fix up and issues that came about from redoing the code. Paradox probably reckons that the cost of putting a game on mobile devices doesn't match how much people would actually pay to play those games on those devices.

> If your post is indirectly related to Victoria, such as a Wikipedia page, you must include a high-quality write-up of how it relates to the game.

Which means it needs to be a text submission that links to the not-game material and a write-up about how it relates to the game."

paradoxplaza,"You really should start on [the wiki's modding page](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Modding) and go from there. that said...

1. Most Paradox game modding can be done with the default text file editor of your operating system, although Notepad++ is a better option for working with multiple files at once.
2. Actual programming is zero part of it, although understanding how programming / scripting languages is very useful to understanding how the game works and how to alter the files to get the results you're looking for.
3. The map in EU4 is generated based on image files with no 3D work necessary.
4. Again, check out the wiki and also the modding subforum in the game's section on the Paradox Forums."

SWN,"> If using these, a scene could be set to a number of exploration turns that pass. Could be as low as every exploration turn or maybe even a full hour (easy to track with a d6 counter).

The guidance in the WWN beta (EDIT - and Wolves of God before it) is to simply count an exploration turn as a scene for the purposes of ability usages."

Stellaris,"It tries to run on multiple cores but multiple issues with the game logic mean that it has to do a lot of the hard math in single file.

To fully explain - Paradox games run the same in singleplayer as they do in multiplayer. Multiplayer works by making everyone's game predict what will happen the same way (when this fails, you get an out-of-sync error). Some of the calculations can be changed depending on other calculations that happened ahead of them, for example calculating which POPs should do which jobs. To make sure that someone with a 4core machine doesnt get a different result to an 8core machine, it does all these calculations one at a time. Because singleplayer is just multiplayer with only one person, it still does all these calculations one at a time even though there's no risk of going out of sync when there's no one else to sync with."

At which point you have to choose whether you want Stellaris's exploration, EU's diplomacy, Victoria's economy, or CK's RPG elements - at which point the core idea falls apart.

SWN,"Lasers already have a distinct advantage with the +1 to hit. The meta is physical weapons for skilled combatants who want to do more damage and laser weapons for ordinary combatants who just want to land hits.

Giving lasers a 100+ ammo capacity means that there would be no reason not to use the burst fire mode on the standard laser rifle, because you go from having 6 rounds before reloading to 33+ rounds. That's equivalent to constantly shooting for over three minutes real time without needing to stop and reload. It also makes laser weapons the go-to choice for long expeditions without supply because you can fit 300+ shots into a single unit of encumbrance whereas a TL3 combat (assault) rifle only gives you 90 shots in the same space for barely more damage (and less to-hit).

Also, you never see people in Star Wars reload because the blasters in it are usually actual guns with a paint job and a little bit of sci-fi shit glued on."

Oooh, that could be a potential issue. Check the specs of the laptop if you're interested in CK3 because the game requires a better PC than other Paradox titles.

> CK3 ... so many things to do.

Part of what makes CK so neat is that beginners can ignore a lot of stuff going on. You dont have to do all the things at once and as you get more comfortable with the basic parts of the game you can start adding focusing on more advanced stuff."
paradoxplaza,"Hmmm.

CK3 is the most polished PDS game so far and as such the most friendly to newer players. It also hasn't had DLC come out for it yet so the base game is the whole game and you wouldn't be missing any parts of it.

HOI4 is cheaper and better supported, although its immediate state is a little bit rickety after the release of a minor expansion with numerous loose ends that need to be tidied up by the devs.

Do you have Game Pass? Because the base versions of Paradox's games are available on that."
paradoxplaza,Did you play CK2? Did you play HOI3 or HOI2/DH?
paradoxplaza,What kind of game do you want to play? CK3 and HOI4 are at quite different ends of the Paradox strategy spectrum.

Stellaris,"You soak in a lot of useless Paradox info when you moderate Paradox subreddits for *checks* oh, five years now. Also, I modded EU3 before I became a subreddit moderator and I did a bit of testing that surfaced info about how Vic2's elections (badly) work."
Stellaris,"Vic2 takes a lot of shortcuts with its calculations. For example, if someone in a POP of one culture changes job and there isnt a POP with the same culture, he'll spontaneously change culture and get added to an already existing POP so that the game doesnt have to create a brand new POP unit which it would need to do calculations with. POP promotions or political opinion shifts are done once per week or month (its been a while since I last looked at Vic2 so I'm not sure what the interval is, but it certainly isnt as regular as it is in Stellaris).

The economic system is also simpler than you may expect. It checks local markets (a nation and its spheres together) and then checks the rest of the world lumped together. Artisans will use whatever materials the game quickly deems appropriate which leads to funny edge cases like building tanks out of fruit. The 8 factory per state limit adds a strong limit on how much calculating the game needs to do for industrial production, because these calculations grow exponentially as the number of entities grow linearly - which is the Stellaris issue where it needs to calculate dozens (hundreds late game) of POPs as it checks dozens (hundreds late game) of jobs that exist."

Stellaris,So it's not in Stellaris?
Stellaris,"> So it is mostly due to the clausewitz engine only using one core of the CPU? 

Clausewitz doesnt determine the core usage. What actually determines it is how the game's logic is laid out.

Stellaris's logic uses a lot of individual calculations for things like POPs and space battles. In another design you could run all of them in parallel but Paradox's games use what's called 'lock-step multiplayer', where each player's own copy runs the whole game and then each player's situation is occasionally checked against each other to see if they're all still together. You can't run all the POP/battle/similar calculations in unrestricted parallel because the results depend on what other calculations earlier in the sequence did. To make sure everyone's computers reach the same result, these calculations are done in a specific order otherwise you end up with an 8-core computer calculating something earlier in the order than a 4-core computer and messing up all the other results that flow on from it.

And finally, Paradox's games are designed to work identically in singleplayer and multiplayer which is why they dont just throw all the calculations at all the threads/cores when you're playing alone.

(QUICK EDIT) If you look at something like Crusader Kings 2 & 3, that game has a lot of calculations with all the AIs planning things but planning is a lot friendlier for multithreading and getting the same results because plans dont usually change any data that other planning entities rely on."

Stellaris,A lot of subreddits use acquired karma as a basic anti-spam check.

The subreddit rules were adjusted recently and a Rule 5 comment is now mandatory. We have done this because what posts were considered obvious enough or what title was descriptive enough was too subjective. Consider explaining how you got to where you are, what you wish to do, what is happening on the image (in a way that a new user can understand it), or what in the image you want to discuss.

paradoxplaza,"To be fair to the Bethesda arguers, a lot of the issues with Bethesda's games comes from the way the engine handles the world as connected cells. It's fantastic for making versatile and easily modded games but its weaknesses with bug fixing and performance are becoming more and more obvious as the years progress. Whereas CK3 proved that most of Paradox's performance design issues were at the level of the game design and could be fixed without significantly changing the engine (because Clausewitz doesn't actually do all that much in the grand scheme of things)."

WWN,"How powerful are the rocs overall?

If they're relatively minor, I'd be inclined to count them as Scouts since they'd mostly be useful for aerial reconnaissance and easily slipping past enemy lines.

If their power is moderate, consider counting them as cavalry. They might be few in number but they could be devastating to be attacked by, especially if a unit isn't used to dealing with aerial offensives.

Finally, use Warshaped if they're supremely powerful beasties. The manual describes those as ""magical creatures designed specifically for warfare"" which could roughly be what a strong roc is like, plus it comes with Subtle so you could sneak (fly) them into places without being noticed."

The subreddit rules were adjusted recently and a Rule 5 comment is now mandatory.

Consider explaining how you got to where you are, what you wish to do, what is happening on the image (in a way that a new user can understand it), or what in the image you want to discuss.

eu4,"Paradox's default value in EU4 is a signed fixed-point with three decimals, which they use all over the place for consistency unless there's a special need for a different value.

Take the 2^32 you usually get with a 32-bit int, knock a power off it for the sign, and then divide it by 1000 and you get the variable's highest value of 2,147,483.648."

paradoxplaza,"Fallout 4 (and Bethesda's game engine more generally) works very differently to HOI4 (and Paradox's Clausewitz engine more generally).

Fallout expansions are basically giant mods because their engine is very compartmentalised. A lot of gameplay features they add in their games are contained in the expansion's scripting rather than the core game engine. This is also why Bethesda game modding is so famous, because modders can do so much with just mods without tampering with the core game code underneath.

HOI expansions, while having a lot of content that mods can replicate like focus trees and art, often include new features that require upgrades to the base game's code itself. This requires updating the original game and moving the version forward, which means that mods need to update their versioning when they check compatibility. Also, because you can play in multiplayer even if you dont have all the DLC the host does, all the DLC features need to be put into the base game."
