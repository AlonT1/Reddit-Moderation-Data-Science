Games,"The studio is very small? I've heard about it being a ""AAAA"" studio. First I've heard about it being small."
Games,This is the game that uses loads of talent from Naughty Dog and other big name studios? Seems weird that the AAAA Sony killer would be an FPS.

Games,"Its very barely an awards show, while the others are right in that you can watch the trailers after. This is much closer to an E3 presentation than to an awards show.

If you haven't seen before tune in and you may like it."
Games,"I think they did a great job at answering those bullets with the activities system. I've already used the tips and video walk-throughs loads of times. Instead of looking up ""Demons Souls <boss>"" and reading through a wiki page to get hints, I just press on the card and show the tips. If I need more help I can watch a video, it's a really cool system."
Games,"The issue is that Uri Geller doesn't say he's a magician, he claims to be actually magic. Not as an act or a performance, actually magic. He makes money off of conning people into this, its the same sort of evil side of magic that faith healers and people who claim to speak to the dead use."
Games,If this is truly a bug how the hell did it get past QA? This kind of thing should be really easy to spot.
Games,"Well my thinking is that actually in The Last of Us you can choose specific chapters to go back to (can't remember if its i tlou2) in Uncharted you can jump to any specific combat scene. So if there's a combat achievement card/task or a collectible task, it could take you to the area or section of the game you would need to be in to get the collectible or achievement. 

Doesn't need to be something you use actively during the game, more something you might use after if your wanting that 100%."

Games,"It literally only skips the travelling and the loading, how is that ""games playing themselves""?. You still have to do the missions and the challenges."
Games,"I don't think it could be, I have to imagine the system is quite hard to set up. Since your essentially telling the game to skip a load of stuff to get you to where you want to be."
Games,I think the thing to think is that an unintended benefit of this is that open-world games could be more obscure in-game whilst using the ps5 menu for those who want a quicker experience.
Games,"I see it more as giving options, some people can only game for short moments at a time, they would be the primary users of such a system. Even here the guy only used it when he had completed the game and wanted to 100%. Absolutely not something a game would be designed around."
Games,"It's not something you'd design your game around, also you wouldn't be able to jump ahead where it doesn't make sense. So no you couldn't say jump straight to a collectible.

I dunno about usage it's a fair question, I could see some AAA using it to advertise to those with less time."
Games,"Yeah I agree, needs some sort of additional filtering, pinning, sorting, choosing. Hopefully a later update will sort that out since in theory they must silently already exist it just picks a few to display."
Games,"This also has quite a big impact in Demon's Souls where you can use it to teleport straight into any of the worlds picking up at the latest archstone.

 When out and about it relinquishes your souls but in the nexus you can do it for free at any point. Shows that this system can work quite intelligently.

Lots talking about open world adventuring and ticking off collectibles but I think anything with levels, paths or different areas could make good use of the system.

EDIT: Also the system is great for achievement hunters, makes that process a load easier."
Games,"Others have said it but not very well IMO 

I think the decision on what games were included was made sometime between the 6th of November and the 12th. At this point, Spider-Man: Miles Morales has been completed by Journalists and reviewed, while Demon's souls had not yet been played by anyone. Sadly I think it only just missed the deadline by a few days."

People of those countries have been more sensible, told they should avoid contact and they stopped meeting with friends etc. In the UK we have an attitude of ""if it ain't illegal then ill do it."" You could think of this as what Boris was referring to when he talked about being ""freedom loving"". 

On the other hand when things did go wrong he ignored the advisors and ultimately has a lot to be blamed for."
ukpolitics,"We know a bit more about lockdowns and there effects now, the 7 week lockdown could probably have been a 4 week lockdown. But we didn't have the testing at the time to know how well it worked."
Games,">Why don't studio's just take the Valve approach to say ""it's done when it's done""?

Valve has a money printing machine, they can afford to take their time or just not release anything ever again.

There's few companies that have this kind of privilege, if companies worked at a different pace then they wouldn't be seen as a good investment and wouldn't be able to get the funding to make the games."

Games,"I think with ""Gamers"" exclusives are what matters, but Sony also has the vast majority of the casual crowd. In the UK Fifa feels like a PS4 exclusive, and is probably the biggest console seller. In terms of how the PS4 ""commanded the generation"" how they made Fifa and CoD mean PS4 in most markets with heavy marketing is worth a mention."
ukpolitics,"The thing with these tests is that if we did the whole circuit breaker lockdown, you'd then be in a position to maintain low numbers really easily. Anyone who comes into the country gets tested, and our surveillance in the UK does the rest, part of the issue at the moment is that it takes so long for people to find out if they have the disease that by the time you've located a trouble area its already too late."

Games,"Side speakers.

Yeah its worth it headphones are very insular and I have a partner I like playing/watching with. I don't want to be too negative on it, its still awesome.

The big issue is that the binaural alternative works really well with like $100 ear/headphones (or even $5). Its a little harder to get the 7.1 in the sweetspot and has to be completely silent elsewhere to give you the proper experience.

Also I just have trailing cables everywhere ha"
Games,"In all honesty as someone who has forked out for a proper home cinema style surround sound, simulated with headphones is often loads better.

I think it's a combination of not being able to hear anything else and then working more naturally with how our ears work normally. 

Even at 7.1 surround 3D audio still feels very fixed in terms of direction where as simulated 3D audio through stereo doesn't really have the same restriction. 

There's a few 3D audio examples on YouTube that use binaural, I'd suggest doing comparisons between that and some stuff on a surround sound setup. If be surprised if the binaural didn't win out."
ukpolitics,"The original csv would still exist as an archive in the pipeline, if its built cleverly they would do a post ingest check which could've flagged this.

I appreciate the use of *Excel*ling, just wish you hadn't called me stupid."
ukpolitics,My guess is that someone opened a csv in excel and then saved it and deleted parts of the csv in the process.
ukpolitics,"This isn't true, or there's a misunderstanding. 

The cases data is on sql as per usual with these things, my guess is that there was an ingestion process with excel as the sending medium and that got too big. Now they send multiple excel files instead of the one."

Games,They are but they still ain't as good as getting the game free from a friend.
explainlikeimfive,"> but my reason for choosing that smaller scale was that even in that things could have changed drastically given the right pressures,

Dogs are the best one to bring up for this, they were domesticated 20,000 years ago or so. But its only in the hundred years selective breeding for specific traits has gone off the charts, we now have a huge amount more variation and breeds. 

Most of which has ended up with some dogs that can't procreate, walk or have serious genetic disorders. In fact some can't even naturally give birth anymore."
Games,"I'm convinced they brought preorders forwards and they were meant to go live at a later date. Instead they decided to capitalise on the press and positive reception, and get preorders out before Xbox.

Think it likely this led to the confusion as they didn't organise a unified message/timing quickly enough. 

I'm betting they sent a message out saying something like ""Start preorders as soon as you can""."

ukpolitics,"The country budget is like a household budget is propaganda mate, its allowed every policy that would improve things to be shot down while also scaling back good services. 

When a government saves money by cutting spending in the long run it gets less money back because ALL of its spending is investment. When you save 10% of your budget you have more money, a country has less.

Think of it like this, when the government spends 100s of millions on a project, tens of thousands of people are paid from this so the government instantly gets some of that money back as income tax. Then those employees spend that money and pay VAT so the country gets some money back. Then the money thats spent ends up as someone elses wage and the country gets some of that in income tax. Eventually the country gets all the money it spent back (minus savings and anything taken off-shore). In fact if any of the people in the chain invest then the country can get MORE back.

Reducing spending proportionally reduces government's income and the economy, and no amount of efficiency drives or cutting of services changes that. These things are directly related. Ask yourself why a decade of austerity has increased our debt."
ukpolitics,"Money spent by government is an investment (or should be) is the primary difference.  You as a household are unlikely to get a return on spending money on your kids, a country will."
Games,"In all honesty I think its quite good for MS that all this info leaked and created a media circus, this presentation felt very flat to me. Very much the opposite of hype generation.

If this had been pitched as the grand event that everyone needed to tune into then I think MS would have recieved some ridicule.

Edit: Judging by some of the Xbox subreddits this isn't an unpopular opinion. Instead of one presentation they owned the headlines for the last week or so."

Games,Corporate espionage is a thing there is no doubt that Sony has some employees that'll be working in Microsoft and Microsoft has some employees working for Sony. They know lots about what eachother is doing.
Games,"I think its slightly different based on whats happening with CoD, this is all conjecture. 

I think all Digital games can be upgraded easily, I think PS5 physical can also be upgraded easily have the PS4 disc download the PS5 version put the disc in and play the PS5 version of the game.

I believe older Xbox One game discs can't act as DRM verification like the PS4 discs for the XSX version of the game. Whether this is a concious choice or a technical thing I am not too sure. Some newer Xbox One games released in the next few months will release on XSX discs as these are functional on X1 and XSX, am guessing theres some cost involved which is why Activision has decided not to do that. Control however is already out there and so nothing can be done for those who own the physical Xbox One version of Control."
Games,"Notable that on the title reveal on the livestream this game is PS4/X1 and omitted PS5/XSX most likely this has some link to why the graphics look bad. Wonder why though, whole looked really lowres like not even 1080p."
Games,"Except a budget 2012 cpu won't be much use in 2018 and you likely will have a maximum of 8gb ddr3 RAM at that price. 
So actually in 2018 you need a new motherboard, RAM and CPU. Also you probably want an SSD."
Games,"PS+ isn't gamepass though, I have to imagine a huge amount of Xbox Live Gold and PS+ goes into their pockets."
Games,"Yeah and 1080p60 could've been the norm on ps4/X1 with lower graphical fidelity, developers chose the graphics."
Games,"It depends really, i think if you are a purist then probably rct1/2 are better challenge but 3 hit a sweet casual/challenge balance."
Games,Honestly I'd say RCT3 is probably the best park management and design game in existence.
Games,"Testament is pretty good also not got much to say against it, in some ways it's a better intro to the series than Crimes and Punishments but that game is where it sorta all clicks.

 Testament is well put together with some good mysteries, its a bit more of an adventure game than the later two but well worth a play."
Games,"Crimes and Punishments, which is ultimately the best one so far. 

They're all sort of B games, don't go in expecting a AAA experience or anything but I've had a lot of fun with some of the games on that list

Crimes and Punishments is good because it lets you choose who you think the bad guy is, it'll let you build an argument for both based on the found clues but they'll be some detail that identifies the killer."

Games,">With the DualSense wireless controller and the power of haptics, we can make the combat [in Demon’s Souls] feel grittier, darker, and deadlier. Now you feel every blow as you strike down your enemies and cast each spell. You’ll experience the force of a titanic boss’ attack as you pull off a well-timed guard. Metal strikes metal when your foes block your attacks or you block theirs. That extra sensory feedback through the controller allows you to know your attack hit home and your perfectly-timed parry was a success, so you can react faster and more decisively.

This sounds really cool, not really had any experience with haptics, is this really over the top or is there a noticable difference to ordinary rumble."
Games,"In this world of digital games, you can literally check and see if someone owns a game and season pass.

Games,"They could at least offer an upgrade path, pay 10 extra to get the ps5 upgrade. Why you have to pay for an entire game (an identical version content wise, I hastened to add) you already payed for to then play it on the new hardware is silly.

AskReddit,"Superhero movies, while they were not exactly unpopular films it seems hard to imagine a time when those films were not the biggest thing of all time each time they came out.

He takes so long to make a single point and then feels the need to call out EVERY single piece of evidence for that point, when a few minutes of speech would more than cover it. Maybe its a criticism thing and he is worried someone will call him out on his opinions unless he explicitly calls out every single detail.

I don't quite get his fans to be honest, you could easily have his script be just as informative and just as descriptive while also being half as long."
Games,Hmm I'd be careful referring to it as the SS in public.
Games,And if it was called the wii 2 do you think the same confusion would have existed?
Games,"By my thinking you are honestly rather wrong. The medium is moving in exactly the direction you seem to desire and I don't think earlier games were as artistic, Silent hill 2 is an exception. 

Most of the highest rated games this generation have expanded upon the artistic elements massively, we've had some of the best stories, art, acting and music ever put in a game. On top of that we've had loads of innovation in this space in recent years, with games that wouldn't have had any audience even a single generation ago.  

Now of course there are money cash cows but they are a specific subset of AAA games which are easily avoidable and in general don't win many awards. Hell on this sub people don't spend long talking about the games that you are arguing against.    

Games if anything are maturing, to go back the other way would be a bad move."

Its why when a main character mentions that they had a brother who they havn't seen in ages, you immediately know that the bad guy is going to be this brother. Its why everyone saw the Arkham Knight twist coming. 

Its also just evidently untrue, lore is essentially superfluous information not necessary for the main story and good lore makes for some of the best storytelling out there."

Games,"> How many of them are first world customers that have third world spending power? Too prideful to pirate but can't afford the full price. Caught up in the hype and too impatient to wait for a sale. Paying what little they can spare to a publisher that, in many cases, avoids paying its own fair share of tax. Sorry this is turning into a bit of a latestagecap ramble I'll just stop here.

I'm not going to say that such a person doesn't exist necessarily but the idea of a first world person with third world spending is a little more complex. 

The purpose of the regional pricing isn't to ensure everyone can play per se but to maximize profitability across regions, games are still a premium item and marketed towards those with money to spend. Now an American who can't get $50-60 in excess spending money across a month lets say, has bigger issues they probably struggle when it comes to affording food, shelter and so forth.

That same person with that same salary in some of these third world countries would suddenly be far wealthier than the average person. The people in those countries are never going to be getting $50 extra money in a month, even though they could be relatively rich to their countrymen."

Games,">Make “easy” halve the damage in and double the damage out, make “very easy/story mode/whatever” cut damage by 75% and double your output. Neither of those are particularly difficult to implement technically

As I say this would likely ruin the experience, you are meant to die 500 times thats the point of the game somewhat. To make Dark Souls work and I mean properly provide a similar experience to that of somebody more able, the accessibility should be a bit smarter. 

Some ideas for example;

* Increase parry timing

* Slower enemy movement/attacks

* Increased telegraphy

* Maybe a constant coop/AI companion

* Increased stamina regeneration 

Sadly anything like this would mean no multiplayer but maybe coop only could be a thing.

E: Don't really get why this is controversial"
Games,">The idea that “hard” games (and we all know the type I mean) are totally justified in not including some level of difficulty adjustments is rooted in elitism and people really really cling to it. 

Let me counter a little, but preface by saying I think all games should definitely do what they can to be more inclusive and I'm not at all disputing that.  

Dark Souls is not a series anyone would be interested in if ""hard mode"" was not enforced, its simply not a fun or interesting game series without its difficulty. The whole series is built around the euphoria of overcoming a seemingly impossible or very difficult obstacle, and as someone who plays most games on easy I am so glad there is no option for that here.

However I'd fine with Dark Souls having an accessibility mode/options provided it was clear this wasn't how its meant to be played and hopefully able to be accommodating while also challenging.

 I think they'd have to be quite innovative with the accessibility to get it to work, it'd likely be much more complicated than just the normal damage scaling. Maybe something with the AI being slower?

Its also questionable, if your software tells you that was a great show then why are journalists and reputable influencers down on it and were mostly positive on the Sony stream? Its not some grand conspiracy people are disappointed. 

I guess there's an argument that the stream which had 1/4 of the viewers of the Sony one was mostly the more hardcore fans."

I should note I'm talking exclusively about marketing and not about actions. In terms of actions Xbox has done some great stuff this generation,  but their marketing spends a lot of time on comparisons instead of talking those points up.  

If Microsoft don't see Sony as a competitor why is their messaging all about being better than playstation."

Nintendo is about having fun with family and friends.
Xbox is about being better than Sony."

Games,"I find this concept so strange, the PS5 and Xbox Series X unlock a load more power for devs. He talks about PC supporting across a range of hardware which is true but PC **doesn't** endlessly support older hardware and a lot of games would have trouble running on a PS4/Xbone PC equivalent these days. It's only because devs put extra work in that they are able to function at all on consoles.

The HDD to SDD is a massive leap and really shouldn't be downplayed, I think that as we get into the gen the impact will be pretty striking.

I think this support either way from Xbox down the line will mean we either have games that are not all they could be on Xbox Series X especially if the game working on Xbox One is the priority, or we have games that to work on the Xbox One are significantly stripped back. History is a good indicator for this, there are very few cross-generation games that look and function well on the older hardware if we are then talking about having that support for a whole generation.

&#x200B;

E: Further I think also that from what we have seen this gen more than any other will allow devs to unlock so much more power and at least for a little while develop agnostically of platform while assuming support. For example, the UE5 demo if there is much truth to it, seems to suggest that considering different LODs is a thing of the past."

Your one goal in life should be to be happy, and if you ain't happy you should be doing what you can to fix that.  

Now often (but not always) the problem of happiness is about framing, most of us have no real reason to feel sad and yet it happens. Most of us currently will be in our own room with our own devices in our houses or with parents for those lucky enough to have someone else to feed us and house us.  

I think there is some base criteria that is required to be happy and most will reach that criteria but be unhappy because we are made to always want more. The trick is to be happy with what you have as opposed to unhappy with what you don't have."

We are starting to get to a time where videogame stories evolve from such basic storytelling, and sure that means not every story will stick with everyone, but I'd much rather have these topics explored."

The important thing is that Abby visibly gained nothing from her act of revenge she is no happier.

E: I'd argue the game isn't trying to make you feel guilty for killing the dog as much as for thinking the dog and other characters didn't matter, they were just props in the story. Like there's a world where the story is played as a straight revenge story and it'd make a pretty standard videogame story, this attempts to be a bit more like reality.

IMO its far more interesting"
ukpolitics,"Always makes me wonder how people even ended up living there in the first place, let alone survive and thrive in that heat before AC and fans were invented."
Gamingcirclejerk,"I'd argue that the game wants you to think of Abby as Evil Bitch until you play as her, thats part of the point. You then play as her and see that actually she is a much better person than Ellie.

Joel's death is the main motivation for the whole game, building it up for too long would make the beginning of the game a drag."
Gamingcirclejerk,"Think of it like this, does Ellie have a happy ending with Abby dead? What actually changes is she suddenly a well adjusted happy person, do we think this fight has lived up to all of Ellie's expectations. She probably has to kill Lev also or the cycle will continue. 

Does Abby seem super happy now that Joel is dead, no she is having nightmares still. Its only in helping Lev that Abby is made happier. 

I agree that Ellie giving up could have been telegraphed a bit better but there's nothing wrong with the decision. She hasn't recieved what she wanted and realised that killing Abby wasn't going to bring Joel back."

Games,"Really my point though I see why it got misunderstood is that, games often give us choices like that, as we can insert ourselves as the character.  I imagine most players saw themselves as Joel in the first game, but this isn't his story, nor is it the players, we can play a violent character and still feel like the violence is overall a bad thing that doesn't help the situation. 

There's nothing wrong with that."
Games,"Not every character needs to be a self-insert. Are you sad the game doesn't give you a choice for Ellie to be gay?

Games,"I kind of feel the same, played a good deal and so far its exactly what you would expect from a naughty dog last of us game. It's more of the first game,  it doesn't stray that much from the themes or gameplay. If you liked the first you will probably like this."

It has a really charming artstyle and avoids being rigid in its platforming style.

Games,">Modern games don't load their entire map in one go, it's still chunked

Never said they did? 

Anyway seems like you are arguing a different point, I'm not against having a hook. The point is that as assets and games get bigger over the next few years HDDs will lag behind more and more, at some point we will no longer be able to support the slow read rates.  To use your hook point, if i have to have a loading screen every 30 seconds for 10 seconds then we have a problem. 

I'd be interested to see what that UE5 demo looks like on a HDD."
Games,">that game appears to have a lot of high quality assets that need to be loaded in constantly.

That's the point really, in the near future more games will be able to do that."
Games,">But there's an associated development cost in creating more unique assets 

I wonder about this one a little, I think there is a cost in having to downgrade assets also."
Games,"You are thinking about it in terms of loading screens, games that ""skip"" loading screens are still designed to have them. If SSDs are properly utilised (which no game truly does by the way) then we are talking about having zero loading screens. Imagine Skyrim but every building and area in the game can be walked into without any transitions.

A game that fully utilises the tech will struggle to run on a HDD, I think Spiderman PS4 is a good example of a game that on a HDD a lot of people mention the game sometimes buffers during swinging as it loads the next city block. Imagine if that happened constantly because each room/scene/area needed to load 8gigs of assets, whether that's realistic or not doesnt really matter as that's what the tech unlocks.

You are thinking too small, with the hardware the newer consoles are promising (and PCs have but dont utilise) you could literally have a game that needs to stream 40 gigs of assets a minute, such a thing would need a lot of memory and loooong load times with a HDD, or just a good SSD."
Games,"But why should we be limited to hardware slower than the current console gen, that makes very little sense."
Games,"Yeah I suppose thats fair, consoles do always tend to be the limiting factor. I do wonder how Xbox One support will hamper MS this gen, if they are the only group still supporting slow storage."
Games,"I don't know, I think you will be surprised. 

If games make use of the SSD properly it won't be enough to have a loading screen. If I load stuff at 100MB/s and I realise I need a particularly large set of assets for the next scenes, I need to start loading that early, maybe box the player into a walking animation or a loading screen. 

If I can now load that same data at 5.5GB/s all of a sudden there's no need for any of that, I can immediately load in massive assets that previously would take half a minute now take half a second. This really opens the door for games to use huge assets without being afraid that it will be impossible to load. I am sure if we were able to ask someone of the big developers they would be able to tell stories about having to ditch or downgrade assets due to being too large to load at a good enough pace. 

Take it the other way and imagine how modern games now would cope if we still had to read data at CD read speeds, developers would never be able to use large assets as they would take 5 minutes to load in, its the same change happening here."

Games,"Its up to developers as opposed to consumers, I agree though I think it likely they will become a requirement quickly."
Games,"I don't think many games will go as far as fully exploiting the speeds, but I imagine developers will jump at the idea that they don't have to load things into memory at 100MB/s. Even at 500MB/s the difference for AAA developers will be noticeable.

Combine it with UE5 loading cinema quality assets."
Games,"Depends what we are talking about, I imagine the god of war teleport is huge amounts of data needing to be read and loaded, getting that into RAM will always take a long time on an HDD. On a super fast SSD you may not even need to have a pause in the game."
Games,"I don't get why people such as yourself are so determined to downplay this stuff, you realise we all benefit from the next generation coming? 

I mostly play on PC, but can recognise that having more powerful consoles means we get games designed with a higher minimum requirement. This is good for everyone."
Games,"Okay fair my terminology ain't great, games need to read assets slowly into memory, this affects how games are designed. If you have a large asset you may need to have a pause to load it in, sequential or not, if we are able to load things quicker then we can design games differently."
Games,">huge file transfers

Yes...thats the point, if games use the SSDs on both consoles properly then they will be able to read more data while playing games, which could have a huge impact on how games are designed and play. PCs have had SSDs for ages but they are not a requirement for many games, Imagine what it would mean if they were a requirement. 

Its not PC vs Console its SSD vs HDD."
Games,Hell with the new consoles weaker PCs with HDDs becomes the limiting factor. I wonder how long support for HDDs will last.

You don't need high quality assets, the point is that you don't need to downgrade or have a limit on asset quality.

Games,"I imagine that a large amount of the time developing games is working out how to downgrade all the assets into a workable form, this is true for most of the history of games. There is a budget for everything running on a screen at any one time, sometimes you have to lower resolution, remove animation frames, particles, viewing distance.  

I have to think its a constant struggle, but massively increasing the budget will make it much easier."
Games,">or a mix of both

And I dunno why they think 12 huts make a city, and 1 building can be its own district, but if that's the cost of the way they design things then I think they need to revisit their older games. Each TES game the scale decreases massively."

Games,"Ending reminds me of the ps1 logo loading noise, thats pretty cool."
Games,"My apologies for being a bit silly there. 

Well it depends I guess, if its a zero sum game and you wanted to expand the worlds but keep the high interactability and detailed environments (sometimes overly detailed) then expanding the scope may involve those maybes.  If you reduce the detail then maybe you wouldn't need to.  

For example there's a designer who is placing those books on bookshelves, setting objects on tables and so on. I'd be quite interested to know how long it takes for a house to be created.  Because of the high level of interactibility in the game that is likely a mammoth task. I wonder if this has an impact on the overall game creation.

I suppose also I'm trying to work out why their games are lacking scale, if it is due to their depth requiring no breadth then I think they are too deep but maybe something else is at play."

Is it really though, I loved the show for quite a while, but casting a critical eye on it.

Its a world that suffers from being for TV, with lots of different writers with no consistency with basically no rules at all. A world in which every combination of ""[insert villain] is defeated by [insert plot device]"" is a viable story. ""A giant T-Rex is defeated by love"" could totally be an episode. 

There's some great ideas and villains but they have a problem with bringing back the best ones every single season with even less effect. Also in a series where everything is urgent and macguffins are constantly in need time travel is never used, that always bothered me.

Anyway I think it could be quite well fixed in a telltale style game, personally if I was the showrunner I'd focus on larger series long stories than individual episodes. I think telltales style works well for it."
Games,"I think you might be in a bit of an echo chamber to be frank, no one I know in the UK even the hard-core fans watch it anymore."
Games,">It’s such a daunting task, nobody has even ATTEMPTED to emulate Bethesda.

Maybe because an extremely interactive bookcase isn't that important?

I think the issue is that it cuts both ways, the level of detail they go for prevents them from doing better things. They can render 5000 plates but struggle to have more than 10 people in what is meant to be the largest city in a province. I'd much rather lose some of that detail, maybe not every house is enterable, maybe not every non-guard character has an interesting story, but the interesting areas of the game are much bigger.

Its a design thing I think less than an engine thing, though the framework they use does have a few known limitations that spoil immersion a bit, the game needs to have loading screens for dungeons/caves for example."

Lockdown 66 million people, you mean, many millions of whom will be put out of work by the lockdown practices. 


I'm also quite interested in that 20 million number,  where has that come from?"
ukpolitics,"That's a silly comparison to make, this is nothing like 9/11. Feels like you're appealing to emotion. We're two thirds of the way to a holocaust of deaths.  

Viruses kill people, it's just a fact. Some of these deaths are avoidable some will have just need delayed by the lockdown. 

The only real way out of this thing is to release the young and shield the old and weak.  If its done properly there's no reason why the death rate should increase by too much. Waiting for a vaccine won't work, what else can you do?"
CoronavirusUK,Having a BBQ with the people you live with is completely fine and not hurting anyone or spreading anything
Games,"To jump back in, those high end pc games are still not doing everything they could be doing in order to support on weaker devices its not just graphics. 

Let's take something like Skyrim it has loading screens between areas for a number of optimisation reasons, because of that no matter what supercomputer you play the game on it will always have a loading screen, whiterun will always look like shit from above, the game has to unload and load the new assets, textures will still pop-in, NPCs will flash to life in default positions. 

Once you are able to design something free of that limitation you get better games on all devices,  not just the consoles. It was noticeable between last console gen,  it'll be a noticeable change in this one. It's not just faster loading screens it's removing the need for as many of them, and a whole range of changes.

When games are designed to run on a higher minimum spec its more than a graphic slider.

E: not sure if anyone is likely to read this edit, but Witcher 3 is a great example of a game that would need a complete redesign to run on ps3/xbox360 tech, you can't set the graphics low enough to ever make that work."
Games,"They also barely matter to the overall thrust of the game, he can take all of that stuff and think ""this will all be explained in the next games, which it absolutely will, and barret surviving is covered by the explanation of it not being his fate. I mean the game says that these are bits of the future. 

Dunno why this is so personal to you

E: let's not forget that you don't know everything that's happening in the original at this point either."
Games,Or maybe just take the dude at his word? The characters do literally say it towards the end.
Games,">The graphical jump from current gen to next gen won't be as massive as prior generations, especially not early on.

There are some big changes that can be made quickly provided you let the previous-gen go. Let's not forget that games that support the current-gen are developed so that they can be made to run on 5GB of ram and an HDD, not to mention the CPU/GPU on the weakest systems. This is below even the minimum specs that most games on PC will suggest. 

Now if you bump up that minimum suddenly you can happily make your game have better lighting effects, more particles, more detailed geometry. Less need to hide load screens behind cutscenes or ladders, no need to replace that mountain in the distance with a low-poly version, no need to reduce the animation frames of objects that are not directly in the camera view.

This is just a few things we can expect from the next-gen. Its quite similar to the change in PS3 to PS4."
ukpolitics,"You clearly have no idea how public sector projects are run, you should avoid commenting about them.

They will be subcontracting another company to develop the application while they define the requirements."
CoronavirusUK,"Nope, not much changed for me both of us are still working.  

But lots of my colleagues feel they are spending too much time with their kids, seen a fair few posts about it across reddit also."
unitedkingdom,And letting those of low risk who don't interact with anyone of high risk isn't going to increase that number.
CoronavirusUK,I think a lot more people are having the opposite problem.
Games,"> Scorn is an first-person horror adventure game. It has shooting mechanics for combat, but the focus is definitely on the environments more than the combat.

Sad to hear that, I was hoping for more of a doom-like or Hexen style of thing."

Except it was?"
Games,You mean the prologue footage that looks nowhere near as high-fidelity as the trailer we just saw?
Games,Love me some Silent Chill
Games,"Literally Silent Hill, I suppose I don't mind if it makes a good game"
CoronavirusUK,">it’s something

It's literally not though, its not even slacktivism. Write to your MP saying nurses deserve a pay rise or covid19 bonus, get others involved. Start a petition."
Games,Imagine being this salty and entitled... I guess being in lockdown means a lot of people have nothing better to do.
Games,Probably little difference back in our more tribal days.
Games,Yeah imo society has always been built around someone taking advantage as opposed to socialistic mutual cooperation.

Games,"Imo its sound levels are all over the place, it randomly includes badly sampled ingame sound effects. Its not bad but its got clear room for improvement."
BritainsGotTalent,My partner is convinced that Katherine is a dominatrix and this is just intended as some public humiliation of Joe.
Doom,"I get that this is what you do, but the real world has deadlines. Mick was offered money to deliver a thing to a deadline, he didn't deliver and Id are being extremely generous if they are paying him bonuses as claimed. 

On another note the DOOM 2016 album is not a miracle and calling it that to make your argument is disingenuous."
Doom,Yeah the argument went off the deep end into crazy town fairly quickly.
Games,CMV: All of OPs favourite games are objectively bad.
Games,Binding of Isaac is a good example of point 2. I've played hundreds of hours on that game and still come across new things or room arrangements.
Games,"I disagree to be honest,  I'm sure there's loads of examples.  I'll see if there is a TVtropes entry somewhere.  Don't really think Kratos in all but the latest is that likeable.

E: The most simple parallel is probably Styx."
Games,"Gamers: We want more interesting varied games, with unique plots and styles.  

Also Gamers: We don't want games that try different things."
Games,"Yes. The AI they made over 14 years ago was advanced for the time,  though a lot of its more advanced features were cut from the game. 

Their AI hasn't really changed massively since then, so excuse me if I don't applaud their efforts."
Games,Warhammer total war is my disappointing game because initially I thought it was 40k.
CoronavirusUK,My mistake didn't realise there was better data out there.
CoronavirusUK,"That bit makes me question the validity, if this is UK then I believe a death under the age of 40 is statistically very unlikely. Don't know if there's more recent data but ONS on the 16th of April says there's less than 3 deaths in any age group under 45. Not sure if that's 3 per 100,000 or 3 as its not very clear.

CoronavirusUK,"There's little gain to keeping a strict lockdown till the numbers are super low, we will still need to release at some point."
CoronavirusUK,"True,  but then what? The numbers already are going down,  when are restrictions relaxed."
CoronavirusUK,"Staying 2 meters away and talking to someone for 15 mins is almost certainly a risk.

Coronavirus can happily live on the fur so the disease could be being transferred."

ukpolitics,"It's not really as simple as that, they don't just hold all the money until the actual date of the flight you booked. They won't have the next few months flights finances in a bank vault somewhere."

ukpolitics,"Why don't you work really hard like I did, cut down on avocados and put a few quid a week into a pot. You will have your own home in 300 years."
Games,"Yeah bad wording, sorry. 

""these days"" were meant to imply not a PS1 version.

What I meant to say is its an inbuilt option, as opposed to a mod on Mobile/Xbox/PS4."
Games,If you are playing anywhere but PC these days you can turn random encounters off.
ukpolitics,"I'll reply longer when I have time but.
We agree that people will die looking at your other post, that's the nature of diseases, I agree that there's not much we can do to stop larger spread. But I also can make sure I don't go near anyone with conditions and they can isolate themselves. 

What do you think is the alternative to a slow release of lockdown for those less likely to die? I don't really see another exit strategy.  

Waiting years for a vaccine isn't really viable"
ukpolitics,"Yes, younger people getting the disease at a slow pace now while those of high risk are isolated will help to protect the isolated. 

Its really not that complex. We know that this illness has an incredibly low chance of killing anyone below a certain age, if people under that age have immunity then people above will be less likely to encounter the disease.

Alternatively if we all remain isolated for the next 6 months and then come out, there will be a second peak where *more* high risk people will die.

I'm really not sure what you think the alternative is"
ukpolitics,"Look, I know your job is stressful, and you have to do some absolutely awful things, I certainly couldn't do it. Very much on your side and not in the clap for the nhs way either. 

But yes, this is a deadly disease people will die and while we can reduce that we can't stop it. As I said the intention of the lockdown is to ensure those with conditions stay safe, its why most people above a certain age or with certain conditions have been told to go further in terms of self isolation and avoid all contact.

Also did you read my post, I didn't mention the economy at all, my reasoning for adjusting restrictions has nothing to do with the economy. The goal of reducing restrictions for those of low risk, while high risk continue to isolate, is actually to protect the high risk. If we isolate for 6 months there will still be a second peak."
ukpolitics,"There's meant to be a second wave,  nothing wrong with that.  

Almost everyone is going to get this disease sooner or later, we won't be holding out till a vaccine. The media are making a mistake when they sensationalise the rate of infection.  

 There are two goals of this lockdown:

1) Ensure that infection rate is staggered so the NHS can cope.

2) Prevent infection for those with  critical conditions and ensure that if they do get infected they can get treatment. 

Now point 1 has some nuance, ideally we want to keep the NHS at a safe working capacity for as long as possible with enough spare for point (2).

 If it starts to look quiet in ICU then we are not doing a good job of tackling the disease. As such bed population in ICU, death rate and infection rate gives us a good measure as to when restrictions should be relaxed."
Games,"Never really understand why no one announces anything with GMT or UTC. its really easy that way to get everyone in the entire globe to understand when something is going to be.

Games,"Mate, money is valuable for living and you can go out and earn more of it. You don't get wasted hours back ever. Life is far too short.

E: I suppose this is a lot more of a  philosophical point really.

I value my time over my money, I think maybe it's different when you are younger or living below necessary expenses."

Time is valuable there's no point in wasting your life playing things that are bad but cheap/free."
Games,">""the game is fine but maybe wait for it to go on sale""

Its rating doesn't improve at a lower price point,  no one wants to spend $60 on a 7. But maybe at $15 a good 7 isn't so bad."
Games,"Ah I misread, maybe that explains it.  Either way it's garbage and obviously doesn't belong there. 

Not overly sure why I'm downvoted on this one.

I love mobile gaming and own most of the premium games worth talking about. But it seems like the 0.000001%."
Games,"Why is the Google Store front page such trash? It's horrendous the list of the top games is full of shit. Sometimes they are also games that are rated like 3.4 right at the top.

Games have so many fake reviews and ratings its unreal, I have played some awful games that were rated 4.5+. Why actually make a good game if you can just pay some Vietnamese team to say its good?

It depresses me, while there are some good games most of the good ones are ports. Mobile games never really had a flash games moment, loads of free (with ads) but good quality games that were not built solely for extracting as much money as possible from the user.

They were almost immediately corrupted by big business, never really had a time of small indie devs making small but good games.

E: The current ""Top rated"" game on Google store is a 3.1 with 29,000 downloads."

ukpolitics,Its such obvious sarcasm mate
ukpolitics,"That's some scary shit, reading the Wikipedia article for that got me reading some more stuff. Took me a down a rabbit hole of sorts, read some more articles on this page:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_killings\_by\_law\_enforcement\_officers\_in\_the\_United\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_Kingdom)

The stuff pre-2000 is very grim seems at least for the most part it's a bit better now. Got to question why the IPCC and CPS exist considering their ineffectivity in general. It's scary to think that if you get shot in the street for no reason police won't get any backlash:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death\_of\_Harry\_Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Harry_Stanley)

Found a really grim one that the wiki downplays a little, You also may mysteriously die of ""drug overdose"":  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death\_of\_Leon\_Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leon_Patterson)

The interesting line on the wiki that isn't really explored is ""At postmortem examination, it was found that part of his nose was missing, that he had severe bruising to his testicles and a total of 32 injuries covering his body. "" Also just the general behavior towards the guy is shocking, transported naked face down, died covered in shit,  ""After six days in custody it was only after death that he was finally given a mattress and a blanket"".

Hell imagine you have video evidence of police letting someone drown in their own blood you would think that would lead to something. Lots of people seem to arrive at custody with life-threatening injuries, funny that:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death\_of\_Christopher\_Alder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Christopher_Alder)

This one is even worse as the punishment for officers involved was ""early retirement on stress-related medical grounds and received lump-sum compensation payments of between £44,000 and £66,000 as well as pensions"".

""Alder was one of 69 people who died in police custody in 1998. Between 1990 and 2011, 980 people died in police custody. Only one police officer has ever been convicted for such a death""

I always wondered why my Dad was so anti-police, in my adult life there haven't been many cases where I would side against them. But seems pre-2000 especially was a whole different world and now I see where the distaste comes from.

You know, on the one hand, I am glad that we are not the US and our list of notable police killings is relatively short. But its scary to think that if you were randomly shot by an officer, chances are they would get no punishment and some compensation."
