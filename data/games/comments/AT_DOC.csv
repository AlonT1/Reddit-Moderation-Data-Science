news,"I did infact listen to the audio. Maybe I was trained wrong, but it's never acceptable for a dispatcher or intaker to be that disrespectful to a person requesting services. To tell a caller to shut up or make better choices is not our job. For what it's worth, I hope the last went quickly and painlessly."
news,"As an emergency services professional, with emergency call taking experience, this one hurts. For a number of reasons 

1. I get that this was the dispatchers last shift after putting in her two weeks. I get that she was mentally checked out. I get that the job can be frustrating with the lack of common Sense runs at time. I get it I do. What I do not understand is the complete lack of empathy and compassion for the RP. We are trained to treat every call with the highest level of professionalism and compassion, treat each caller as if it's a grandparent. The lack of sympathy and concern for the caller, during an incident that could litterally happen to any one, is sickening and disheartening. The one thing I can't quite understand is why the dispatcher isn't trying to make a clean and precise delivery of when help will arrive. Even if you have checked out, it's still a force of habit to give an ETE OR ETA of responding units. That should be criminal negligence, as should the comment about ""risking their lives."" It might not be, I don't know; I've never seen a case study of something of this magnitude, but it most definitely is inhumane and unethical. 

2. The lack of empathy from the Police Chief is even more concerning. Some one litterally die under the watch of a person on his payroll. SOMEONE DIED. His dispatcher went on a power Trip and wasn't focused on the greater mission of ""so others may live."" His response should have been ""We will launch an immediate review of our internal policies and procedures. We will also ensure our staff under go sensitivity training and have a Employee Assistance Program available to ensure our stuff are processing after traumatic calls effectively and safely. While that individual is no longer employed with us, we will be launching an investigation to determine if any criminal or legal actions need to take place."" The lack of any steps to move forward and prevent from happening again shows a deep organizational leadership issue. 

All and all a absolutely horrible tragedy. With out knowing more information I can't determine survivability."

relationship_advice,"Yep, easy mistake friend! I've been following this from a far because it's one of those ""what's going to boil up next."" It seems like with every new post there was some new escalation . He made numerous comments and snide remarks on the very first post that I think has been removed. I honestly feel bad for the gal."
relationship_advice,"Ordinarily I'd agree with you. On some of the first posts he made about the situation, the comments (maybe now deleted) were not innocently put. There was one that stood out as ""I told her she either gets an abortion and cuts off her mother or I'm leaving her ass."" There were others along the lines of ""I can love with out her, but she can't live with out me."" As someone that works in emergency services there's allot of context that we look for. If the context and patterns indicate abuse it's likely abuse. The major thing here is through out the narratives that he is providing he is making it out that he is doing her a favor and that the mother is evil and vile. 

You're right the lady is a grown woman, however, when you are mentally abused and conditioned, it's all you know. There are many forms of abuse and many forms of manipulation. If this all happened exactly as how the op relayed it, than I'm sorry, grown woman or not, being given major ultimatums that includes severing relationships with family members or else is abuse."
relationship_advice,It's a common tactic! Cause isolation with parents. Ramp up the abuse.
relationship_advice,"I think what makes this even worse (I'm pro choice,) is that this whole ordeal started with a series of ultimatums. OP stated in early posts, if you don't get an abortion I'm leaving. Mum threatens to disown. Op threatens to leave. I don't know why, but something about this entire situation isn't sitting well. 

I feel like there are bigger issues at play here and it makes me very concerned for OPs girlfriend. I feel like there is more than likely emotional abuse going on behind the scenes. Just the whole way the story is being told and relayed gives off some very concerning red flags. I get the need for dark humor as a coping mechanism, but at the same time, the OP wasn't the one that was raped, the OP wasn't the one that received the abortion and the OP wasn't the one that ended up having a family fall out. So why make jokes at the GFs expense, which circles back to makes me wonder about abuse at home. 

Like I said, just doesn't sit well."

There were a few texture bugs, a few combat bugs that I noticed that were frustrating, like ghouls appearing from under ground. There were instances were things that should drop things were not dropping. 

From a speculation side of things, these issues are pretty important and they NEED to delay the beta, until the overheat issue is resolved.

BSA,"Starting in the 2018 program year, families can choose to sign up their sons and daughters for Cub Scouts. Existing packs may choose to establish a new girl pack, establish a pack that consists of girl dens and boy dens or remain an all-boy pack.¬† Cub Scout dens will be single-gender ‚Äî all boys or all girls. Using the same curriculum as the Boy Scouts program, the organization will also deliver a program for older girls, which will be announced in 2018 and projected to be available in 2019, that will enable them to earn the Eagle Scout rank. This unique approach allows the organization to maintain the integrity of the single gender model while also meeting the needs of today‚Äôs families."

BSA,That hasn't been the mission for at least 30 years.

‚Ä¢a new youth protection training encompassing coed issues and other safety concerns is currently being developed and will launch in 2018.

The amount of patient information,  accounting  payroll and personnel records that was left unsecured is illegal.  These documents needed to be destroyed.

The Biohazard is a completely separate issue. There was sharps,  narqs, Caths, blood test vials(full) and other unidentified materials mixed in. When this facility was closed  the administration should have taken steps to properly and legally dispose of this infectious waste.  

Both of these items coupled with the rapid abandonment of the property points towards some illegal things occurring at the facility.

This was scene as a better alternative than jail for this specific population. Residents at the Poor Farm were required to provide labor.
