Games,"Evidentally they're not fans if they're scoring it that low.

User reviews are always flawed systems, but they're doubly flawed on those meta/open critic sites because there's no proof required that the reviewer played the game, and doubly *more* so when there is ample evidence that the game in question was review bombed by multiple communities.

Critics and fans alike praise the game to no end, it's absolutely earned the accolade."
Games,Minecraft came out a few years back - TGA awards only consider one years' worth of games for GOTY
Games,"Hype is a measure of popularity. Gaming now is more popular then ever, and will likely continue to become even more popular.

Consider say Super Mario Bros 3. It was very hyped at the time and had a massive following. But that is *nothing* compared to Cyberpunk's, today. Not because Cyberpunk is a 'better' game or anything like that, just that gaming is bigger then ever, and the hype stretches across so much more gamers and the communities they frequent.

Cyberpunk is almost certainly 'the most hyped game ever', but with the asterix that over the next couple of years something will probably overtake it for the same reason Cyberpunk overtook GTA5/Shadowlands/Overwatch/whatever - because gaming will be bigger then then it is now."
pcgaming,"COD 2019 earnt 600 million in revenue in just the first three days of its release last year. At $60 a pop that's 10 million sales. In three days.

They're doing fine."
Games,"The encounter with Shattrath and what would become the Scryers depicts a different Kael - one blind to the needs of his people. Considering the Blood Elf lore at that point it doesn't seem like much of a stretch to assume his addiction gradually took hold of himself and he became driven by it.

> Kael being in cahoots with the Legion was revealed AFTER TK.

I thought questing in Netherstorm revealed this - I could have sworn there were demons mixed in with Kael's Blood Elves at at least one of the manaforges."
Games,"> Illidan, Vashj and Kael

Kael being a villain absolutely made sense. He betrayed Illidan to become an agent for the Burning Legion, in exchange for power - which was *absolutely* in character for him to do. That alone made him an enemy. The raid was a reaction to the siphoning of the magic in the Netherstorm, which was a huge amount of power that you do not want in the hands of the Legion. Plus you have the Scions' history with Kael - he absolutely earnt his raid encounter.

Vashj was siphoning water from Zangarmarsh, which was throwing the local ecosystem into chaos. Her naga enslaved broken + other natives, and likely would have enslaved us if given the chance. It's also not like we've ever really gotten along with the Naga either. I'll grant you that there's not as much against her, but she certainly was no ally and was causing major problems for the Alliance, Horde, and Outland local races in that area.

Which leaves Illidan. At his hand he orchestrated the second emergence of the Fel Orcs, siphoning Magtheridon's power to do so. Again, it's absolutely in character for Illidan to seek power at any cost, and be completely *blind* (Get it?) to the consequences of it. A Fel Orc horde is really all you need to make things personal for both the Alliance and the Horde - neither want a rerun of that particular episode. 

No one knew that Illidan's end goal was the destruction of Kil'Jaedon/the Burning Legion - only that he was raising an army capable of conquering worlds and doing so our doorstep. I'd say that's reason enough for the Alliance and Horde to see him as an enemy. It's also consistent with their storywriting that Illidan's good deeds go completely unrecognized."

Games,"Heyo,

We've spoken to the volunteers and are enforcing YouTube as the primary source this year, at least for the major trailers. This might mean that a couple of posts get posted 5~ minutes later then they would (If the trailer was available on Twitter earlier), but you should be seeing far more YouTube content for this year's TGA."
pcgaming,"... I did not expect you to claim that the Swedish Chef from the muppets is significant enough a figure in gaming over Brie.

Brie's role in Scott Pilgrim (which is, among other things a celebration of gaming), as well as her role as Captain Marvel (A different incarnation of which was the main character in the story of the Avengers game, released this year) makes her *far* more relevant in gaming then the bloody Swedish Chef, lol.

She's a fine presenter - both are TBH. The only thing 'forced' was you trying to justify the sodding Swedish Chef over her at TGA."
pcgaming,"I've read four different TGA threads on three different subreddits now. I've seen a lot of people complain about Brie's selection as one of the presenters and citing that she's not a gaming figure or ""a real gamer"", and who are generally unhappy about it. Yet while reading all those comments, not once have I seen someone being frustrated, upset or uncomfortable about how the Swedish Chef from the Muppets is also presenting an award. 

Now I could be wrong here, but last I checked the Swedish Chef is not a gaming figure or strongly involved in the gaming community.

It's just not, nor never has, been a requirement for this gig. Celebrities have been involved in TGA for a while now, and not once has this weird requirement come up or been a problem. People embraced seeing famous celebrities enjoying the same hobbies they do. It bothers me that the 'rules' for who is appropriate to present at TGA seem to be different just for this one person."
Gamingcirclejerk,"Uj/ Here's the thing: They might actually be right.

Keanu famously gave away his Matrix money to the CGI guys because he felt they earnt it more. He has a huge history of doing stuff for free or giving things out for free. He's claimed that money means nothing to him, and while I'd take such a statement with such a huge grain of salt normally, he's certainly done a lot in the past to prove it - more then most anywho.

Not that I'm against celebrities being apart of these events as a gig, I think it's great for our image and gaining mainstream appeal. Just that if I were for *that* particular train of logic, Keanu being an exception kinda makes sense."
Games,"To be fair, the current version of Cyberpunk was expected to be *extremely* buggy. 

The game went gold in early October (this is the build of the game that's on those discs), even though the infamous crunch period has extended *far* beyond that. You don't do two months of extra crunch unless a day one patch is *really* needed.

We'll know how buggy the game truly is on launch, after that patch."
pcgaming,"Where the hell is she ""trying very hard to look like a gamer""? Here are the things I know off the top of my head:

- She's admitted to playing Smash, Metroid, and Zelda in interviews when asked if she plays games.
- She's admitted to dressing up as Samus one time for Halloween and posting pictures on social media about it at the time.
- She posted a picture of herself with a Dualshock 4 controller.
- She accepted a gig presenting an award at TGA.

She's just a celebrity who, among other things, plays games. I have no idea where you're getting ""she is trying very hard to look like a gamer"" from any of this. Would you just rather she lie in interviews and just try to hide the fact that she plays games/has consoles on social media?

The only ""real gamers"" put aside and being made fun of are the people who are trying to gatekeep who or what a ""gamer"" is, when in the reality the rest of the world has accepted that anyone who plays a bunch of games on their phone is a gamer and that's fine.

Also, I don't know why you brought up her sex - I didn't."
Games,"I'd *want* to, but I don't think the game would be better because of it. Part of the reason I still remember him vividly over a lot of other comic relief characters in various games is because of how it ended."
Games,"Overwatch, *maybe*? GTAV seems like a contender. Portal 2?"
customhearthstone,"Eh, if you draw it it's still an 8 mana 8/8 with Rush and Taunt. It might not be a card you'd want to put in your deck, but it isn't bad either. 

More importantly, if you're playing a Murloc deck and you're at turn 8, you're out of gas and yet you still have the option to spend an entire turn developing a threat, protecting your smaller murlocs and maybe removing an enemy minion, all without wasting any mana. That can't be that bad an option - considering likely your only other plan would be to hero power and play a 2~ drop.

Though I like the idea of making it non-playable from hand (so you couldn't play it by spending mana as you would any other card) but keeping the ""play from anywhere"" part of the effect in the condition. That way you're forced to fulfill the condition, and that condition is a very Murloc-y one."

Games,"Nice!

I'm not heavily against Act 4 (I actually really like the premise), but *defending* forts felt a lot less fun then *attacking* them. While I could just let them take it initially then take it back afterwards, half my orcs would die and it didn't feel the same to me - It felt like the victory of taking the fort was diminished by me having lost it earlier.

Still, act 2 was great, and act 3 has some great moments. Also act 3 has one of my favourite plot holes: >!The two characters who are the most dedicated towards controlling or destroying the rings of power at that time in the lore of LOTR just *walk past* a ring of power discarded and lying on the floor!<."
Games,"Shadow of War was a genuine GOTY contender for me when it released. It had flaws, and a couple plot holes, but something about it just clicked for me.

Having said that, I didn't grind out Act 4. I had my fill, was satisfied, and moved on. Maybe my opinion would have worsened had I stuck around long enough."

pcgaming,"Have you talked to many animal crossing fans? They can go as far as keeping spreadsheets on prices, be in multiple discords purely for community features, and sink multiple hours into it a day, every day, for months.

'Gamer' is not a sacred term, and someone who plays Animal Crossing for 10+ hours a week is just as much a 'Gamer' as someone who plays DOOM Eternal 10+ hours a week, or CS:GO. 

Hell, I've looked at multiple communities for Hidden Object games, Horse Breeding/Horse Lifestyle games, many different mobile games and even communities built around ""Dress up doll"" games (Well, the non-pornographic ones at least). All these communities are filled with dedicated fans who are trying to get 'better' at these games, who analyze these games critically to gain insight on the genre, who swap advice/strategies, and just are genuinely passionate about what they play, and end up sinking as many hours in their thing as you would in say, DOTA 2. They're gamers, through and through.

Also, Brie is also a fan of Metroid, which is pretty 'gamer' credible."

Games,"My understanding is that the bulk of the criticism about CP77's non-stance on trans identities came *before* the trailer showing that particular poster. People were worried they wouldn't tackle/address body-modding in relation to Gender dysphoria.

Some people reacted negatively to the poster and how it was presented - usually concerned that it seems like a rather token acknowledgement of trans identity. But others praised it due to depicting a trans person as the norm (well, the 'norm' of an abnormal world)."
Games,"The ""worth"" of a product will always vary from person to person. I was just trying to point out that using Jim's logic, there's no reason to put a cap on the $60 priceline. 

Jim's logic is that it's OK for an individual to think that game A should be worth $60 but game B should be worth $50, it's not then hard to extend that logic and imagine a situation where game C ends up being worth $70.

As for how much that matters when you zoom out and analyze the market, eventually it *will*. Maybe we're already there."
Games,"> Collector's Editions and Guides/Hint Hotlines didn't actively rip out the certain pieces of game content to be added exclusively to those editions.

Cut content has *always* been apart of game development and has always robbed players of content that could have been part of your favourite games. Today, with the opportunity for serving DLC as a product to players post launch, that content-that-would-be-cut has the chance to see the light of day, and if you're not interested then you can just not pay for it.

I don't think I've even heard of a real case of complete content being *removed* from a game before release only to be sold afterwards as DLC - just cases where content was cut close to deadlines due to not having the resources to finish it, and instead starting a project to develop and implement that content as a purchasable DLC product. 

Maybe it happens, but I doubt it's common practise - why make your product less good on launch? Why waste development resources on developing content you're not including in the major product, *at the time when you need those resources the most*? You're reducing both the sales of your games release, and the potential customer base who could then buy your DLC product. This argument just has never made sense to me."
Games,"Honestly I'm with you on that as well. I'm sure there are examples of games that genuinely held off what could be considered 'core' aspects of the story and/or gameplay behind day 1 DLC bundled into a collectors edition or whatever, but in my experience the standard version of a game usually offers a 'complete' experience, regardless of whether you can get more content from a collectors edition, or DLC down the road."
Games,"I agree on that front as well. The point I was trying to make wasn't that each game has some objective, universal value associated to it, but that putting a cap on such values just doesn't make that much sense. It's entirely possible for some people to think a game is worth more then $60, and that's OK."
Games,"Perhaps the better phrasing to use there was ""In the AAA gaming space, and from a profit POV, it's usually more efficient to invest more money into marketing then you'd invest in the actual development of the product"".

I never meant to make marketing sound like some magic hole that duplicates money effortlessly (though speaking as an outsider, at times it feels like it can do exactly that)."
Games,"""Laid off"" (or being made redundant) is not the same as being fired.

The bigger problem there is the lack of employment protections in the US, where there's no real formal process for making someone redundant, and nothing protecting the employee from being suddenly let go, through no fault of themselves.

This is not the norm in most western countries."
Games,"Crunch was a real deal in the 90's and 2000's - hell, the most infamous example of crunch is EA Spouse, which was in '04. Sadly, there's nothing 'new' about it. Same with news coverage - if you look back, there's plenty of articles and writeups on how many hours these people are working. You could argue they have had an effect (since no report of crunch that I've seen recently rivals that of the EA Spouse-levels of crunch), but that's a small consolation prize."
Games,"Jim makes some good points, but also some points that are based on rather... sketchy information.

He takes a pass about how much publishes spend on marketing, but the truth is every dollar spent on decent marketing ends up making >$1. It's strictly worse *not* to spend that much on marketing when you're at that scale of development. This is a tad depressing, but it's also irrelevant to the pricetag of a game - whether $40, $60, or $80, it will almost always be profitable for publishers to invest heavily into marketing.

He calls into question the current trend of games having multiple versions on launch and that the $60 version may not be the complete version, but that's not actually a new thing. Granted, it's much more common for GOTY/Collectors Editions/etc to happen now on launch then before, but it was still a thing back in the late 90's/early 2000's - Warcraft 3 comes to mind as a game that launched with a Collectors Edition. You could go back even further and point blame at the various 90's adventure games who leaned on paid hint phone lines and guides as a secondary purchase for ""the complete experience"" of a game. I'm not saying it was 'right' then, only that tactics like this aren't new.

He criticizes the notion of raising the price of a game to $70 in order to prevent layoffs, but uses the Activision/Blizzard 800~ headcount layoff/redundancies early last year as an example here. Now, that notion (higher prices = preventing layoffs and redundancies) is not expressed in the VGC article, nor any article/by any person I'm aware of. As for the A/B example, it's completely irrelevant. Right or wrong, those A/B layoffs were due to roles they no longer had a job for - it would have happened regardless of the pricetags of their products.

Jim touches on the idea that not every game that's been sold for $60 has been worth $60, which I very much agree with. But TBH that logic can go both ways, right? It's entirely possible for the majority of games to be worth $60 or less, but for certain few to be worth more.

TBH, the problem I have with this whole system is that we're pricing every new game at the same price by default, and that's just all kinds of bizzare to me. I don't mind that games like TLOU2 or RDR2 - which put much more effort into the quality of the various game, graphical and audio components of the game then most - could be priced higher then those that don't. I also don't mind that games might consider launching at a lower pricepoint, if they feel like they don't have the content that could rival the average release - Overwatch launching at $40 USD comes to mind."

Games,"Ever heard of ""John Wick Hex""? It's an officially licensed John Wick indie game - which is kinda incredible by itself. But anywho, the game is turn-based, but with each turn depicting a tiny fraction of time. Essentially it means you can use a turn to step out of the firing line of one bad guy, into melee range into another. Then disarm him on the next turn (taking his gun), only to spin and shoot a third bad guy with the new gun the turn after, all of which would play out in a second or two of real time.

At the end of every mission the whole timeline is replayed back to you in real time (similar to what Super Hot does), but IMO this is where the 'Hex' part gets in the way of things - because all gameplay and movement operates on a Hex-grid system, the movement looks really unnatural, which clashes hard with the whole feel of the John Wick power fantasy. 

Honestly the whole idea might have actually worked out really well if you could find a way to take the Hex system out and replace it with something more organic and natural. Toribash is a game in a similar vane - a turn-based 1-on-1 fighting game where you can do incredible stuff that looks amazing when played out in real time afterwards, yet accessible to the layman because each complex action you execute is done via a bunch of simple actions done through a turn-based system."

pcgaming,"So I did a quick google. Most of the results are related to the 1.30 or 1.31 patches, which deployed well *before* reforged, and contained the bulk of the editor changes/fixes. The patches between 1.30.1, 1.30.4, and 1.31.1 all focus on fixing these various issues.

There is logic changes that can absolutely break a map in the current version of Reforged - but its uncommon, and is far more likely just to make unintended visuals appear then cause any major issues. The extra desync issues added during the above patches no longer happen (or at least, desyncing is as common now as it was a few years ago), and many maps that failed to load, or crashed shortly afterwards due to editor changes have had fixes/workarounds applied.

I can't say exactly what *is* still affected to become unplayable, but I can say that over the months since release I've played the greater part of my collection of maps I had gathered over the years and they all still launch and run fine. One of the wind towers in YouTD creates an effect from the center of the map instead of the position of the tower, and one of the older versions of Cube TD that I had has a weird Poison + Frost interaction that outright stops units instead of slowing them, but things like that aren't entirely common. 

The heavy majority of maps I tested are playable as they were before, with most of the remaining few maps having minor visual glitches at most (Like YouTD). Really the only map I tried that was truly 'broken' by the move was that very old Cube TD map - and I can't say for certain that particular version wasn't bugged prior."
pcgaming,"I'm aware he was likely modelled in-house, but he still looked like an anime character, even back then.

Honestly, Arthas is a weird example to pull out IMO, very little was really changed in his design. I'd have a go at the new Acolyte model, or Tauren, or Warden, before something like Arthas (In any of his models)."
pcgaming,He looked like an anime character in the OG as well.
pcgaming,"No custom map content has been removed. There's a couple bugs that have been 'fixed' which can cause some issues (Namely the ""Tornado"" buff icon attaching an effect where previously it didn't, or some previously global script variables being given proper scope definitions, leading to them resetting to defaults every now and then), but none that crash existing maps or outright make them unplayable. None of the major bugs were touched (Disable Spellbook glitch, looking at you), likely for this reason.

There has been content and updates to the map editor since 1.27 (Where I believe the Reforged project started) onwards though. 24 player maps instead of 12, an abundance of QoL improvements in the Trigger Editor, increased map sizes (Both in MB allowance on battle.net and tile count per map)... To say Custom Maps 'lost content' is weird - it's just not true.

Single player changes are few and far between, all things considered. The big one is that the computer AI was updated slightly, which is both a good and bad thing. Most other changes were minor creep placement/being switched out for others, and flavour stuff (like the Stratholme layout change, Silvermoon Ice Bridge and switching the Lordaeron trolls from spear throwers to axe throwers). But no change impacts the overall campaign (or skirmish) experience.

I don't think the abandonware/""Different game"" thing applies. Warcraft 3 has 32 major patches, and plenty of minor. Should 31 different versions of Warcraft 3 be considered ""Abandonware""? Should full support be expected for all, including online features?"

customhearthstone,"This card just kinda seems written specifically for new C'thun (Come to think of it, Mechathun as well) and not much else - even decks built around the other Old Gods will have likely drawn their god before being at 10 or less, due to excessive tapping, making this a dead card.

Maybe change the effect to ""Draw the highest cost minion from your Deck..."" instead? Then wild might use it to gaurantee a Void Lord in hand for example, and future expansions might use the powerful effect since most don't feature 10-cost minions.

Edit: Wait, Giants. Shit. Make it ""It costs (3) less mana."" then?"

Games,"> Warcraft was originally envisioned as a Warhammer game, but they didn't get the license.

(Sorry for the really late reply) I keep seeing this, but can't find anything to confirm it. In [this article](https://www.gamesradar.com/au/making-of-warcraft-orcs-and-humans/) about the making of Warcraft 1 it mentions that only Allen was for the idea, but it was never formally considered (nor offered/license applied for/rejected by Games Workshop), and from very early on in the game's development cycle they were determined to own the rights/retain creative control over Warcraft.

Though obviously Warhammer would still be a major influence in the visual design of Warcraft (and later Starcraft)."

hearthstone,"The broad strokes are the same for a lot of different metas. It's just the finer details that are different.

Golden Monkey RNG won or lost *so* many games on the tournament stage, and there's plenty of other culprits, whether they be ""Who drew X first"" (Galakrond, Dr Boom Mad Genius, Anduin/Rexxar/Jaina DK mirrors, Justicar...), or an old classic like ""Won because Rag hit their Rag"" or ""Won because Knife Juggler juggled Leeroy"".

I've seen some fantastic control matches in my time as a viewer, but I aint about pretending that a lot of tournament matches (*especially* control mirrors) weren't about pissing around for the first 5-15 turns only for the match to be decided by bullshit coinflip RNG. But that's just the game Hearthstone is, and always has been."

Games,"> RPGs weren't looked kindly upon during Diablo's development.

Turn-based games weren't. Diablo started off as a AAA Roguelike, but during development [Blizzard pressured Blizzard-North](https://youtu.be/VscdPA6sUkc?t=1366) to make it real-time. They ended up complying (after some resistance). The entire genre was born from a decision from corporate to chase a trend mid-development.

(Bit of a sidenote, but would anyone else kill for a Roguelike that's basically a turn-based Path of Exile?)

> The OG Warcraft also wasn't chasing sales. Dune II may have been a great title, but it wasn't leading the industry or anything.

A number of trends were starting to surface around then. Again, Real-time games were on the rise and turn-based games were on the fall. Just look at the impact Wolfenstein 3D and Doom made, despite the fact that turn-based Dungeon Crawlers from a first-person perspective of a similar vein existed well before either. 

As for the S part of 'RTS', Westworld themselves leaped off of Dune 2 and started developing Command & Conquer after realizing the potential of the genre. Outside of that though Blizzard didn't have much competition in the field, but they made the decision to compete based off of predicting a trend - which it's fair to say they called correctly. Dune 2 also sold *incredibly* well, and it took years after release for Warcraft 1 to *eventually* outsell it.

The other trend surfacing was online multiplayer (Warcraft 1 released in '94, the same year Doom's online component released), which was a huge part of Warcraft 1's draw, and no small part of its success.

I'm not saying they're not money hungry - only that they were back in the day as well, and that's fine. They made great games, and (IMO) still do."
Games,"Starcraft 2 broke records and created waves - it got us Twitch, among many others.

Diablo 3 I think still holds multiple PC Gaming sales records, and has been the only thing rivalling PoE.

Overwatch and Hearthstone are still going strong. Their modern games are absolutely exceptional when compared to the 'average' release of any other company - just as Warcraft and Diablo were back in the day."
Games,"It always was. It made its name in the 90's by chasing sales and marketing trends. It just also did that with fantastic games.

Their games today are still some of the best in their respective genres, and they're still chasing sales/marketing trends."
Games,"Over 10 years of support and content is fine - great even - by contemporary standards.

As for comparisons to their previous work, WC3:RoC came out mid 2002, and I'd argue the last major addition/content patch involved the Firelord tavern hero, which came out in late 2004. So yeah, SC2 had a great run."
Games,"Over ten years of support and content is far, far more then most games get. Blizzard did well here, regardless of how you paint it.

Also, there were plenty of methods companies used to trick kids into spending their parents credit card in the 90's. That's absolutely not a new thing."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,"<3

Edit: Yo WTF?"
Games,"Mandatory Overtime is absolutely ""Crunch"". I am not American and have similar labour laws to the EU, and absolutely consider any form of mandatory overtime - whether compensated or not - to be crunch. That's just what crunch is: being pressured into a >40 hour workweek."
Games,"That ""48 hour week"" figure isn't confirmed by any report or source I know (It wasn't in Jason's Bloomberg article). I bring it up because it seems reasonable to at least question the assumption of 8 hour days, since they're doing mandatory crunch anywho. While I'm at it, the ""6 weeks"" bit is also misleading - CDPR have reportedly been crunching since [at least January](https://www.thegamingeconomy.com/2020/01/17/analysis-cyberpunk-2077s-crunch-controversy/).

The 'controversy' isn't because of any one news piece, it's because CDPR have started being consistently inconsistent, and people are losing trust in the company because of it. They've repeatedly stated that the game is ""essentially finished""/""Playable start-to-end"" and that they're polishing bugs since late 2019, and while that is no small process and can absolutely take some time, it's been pushed back twice now from its scheduled release since those statements - which makes you really question how honest such a statement was.


CDPR aren't guilty of anything that other developers aren't - they're not evil and this is far from EASpouse territory. But many people simply think they've no longer earnt the free pass that they've gotten from a lot of gaming communities."

Games,"> CDPR did consider delaying again **but mass majority of devs** supported extra day for 6 weeks.

This claim isn't actually made by the GameInformer source, at least not in the podcast. Here's a transcript of the relevant section:

> ""From what I understand, from talking to a few people there there was a discussion on ""Do we want to delay the game again or do we want to do this?"", and from what I heard it was the mass majority saying that they agreed to the six day work week"".

(Edit: [Source](https://youtu.be/DwqCBCj9TVk?t=3542) of quote)

GameInformer claim a ""Mass Majority"" voted for 6 day mandatory work weeks rather then delay the game, but didn't mention who was involved in such a discussion or who/how many people were asked to vote. It could be a discussion involving everyone at CD Projekt Red (making the quote accurate), or it could be a discussion between just the team leads, or even possibly people from CD Projekt (The publishing side of the company, 'there' isn't specifically qualified as CD Projekt Red in this context)."

The linked twitter comment appears to be sensationalized (Not the fault of OP). At no point does the source clip in the podcast confirm ""the majority of Devs"" voted for mandatory overtime instead of postponing the deadline. Here's the quote they seem to be basing that off:

> ""From what I understand, from talking to a few people there there was a discussion on do we want to delay the game again or do we want to do this, and from what I heard it was the mass majority saying that they agreed to the six day work week"".

Game Informer made the claim that there was a discussion on the topic, and in that discussion the ""Mass Majority"" of people agreed to delay the game, but said nothing as to who was involved in the discussion/whether it was company wide or not.

pcgaming,"That term is filtered for the simple reason that it's a common term within rule-breaking comments. Every country has their own colloquial slang, as do generational gaps, political movements, religious views, and any other social group. When we see a term that's used mostly in an uncivil fashion, we filter it - regardless of its source.

As for the ""people filter"" thing: that's simply not the case. Were that our goal, there are a bunch of ""better"" ways to do something like that (which some other subreddits do or have done in the past) - from bot bans (silently removing all comments and submission from specific users using automod), to third party bots that integrate with Mass-Tagger/Pushshift/any equivalent that mass-ban users based on participation to select subreddits, to simply removing all 
transparency from rule and ban enforcement - none of which we do, nor (to my knowledge) have we ever done in the past. Because we're in no way trying to apply a ""People Filter"".

customhearthstone,"My thinking is that you'd probably only play this secret in a deck that valued board control above anything else, so you *probably* have it. Noble Sac could fit that deck as well, since it complicates your opponent trying to trade up."
customhearthstone,... Why not just Noble Sacrifice + this instead? Same result for two less mana and you can do it in Standard!
customhearthstone,"Between this, Repentance, and Sacred Trial, Paladin has access to three seperate secrets that punishes their opponent for playing a big minion, but no secrets that punishes their opponent for playing a small minion (At least not by my count). So while I love the flavour, it being a secret doesn't seem to add much.

Hilarious synergy with Eye for an Eye or Noble Sacrifice though. That alone might make it worth it."

Games,"> I have to say it must be entire Acti-Blizz because then the other 'only Blizzard lost 200 to 400' doesn't make sense in light of Versailles being laid off.

Acti-Bliz has an office in Paris as well, it's possible that the 200-400 figure could be citing Acti/Bliz + Bliz positions lost in France overall, rather then from either office/company in France. Doesn't seem likely, but then neither does that figure as a part of the 800 total jobs lost in '19.

There was definitely a lot of misinformation at the time, and certain details certainly weren't clear. Thanks for doing your part (and then some) to help clear some things up!"
pcgaming,"Aye, but there's a serious financial incentive for Blizzard to try to avoid laying off *everyone*.

Considering Acti-Bliz operates an office in Paris, some people could be offered positions there to save on paying out redundancies."
pcgaming,"Just to clarify: At no point did they try to *fire* 800 people in 2019. Layoffs and firings are very, very different things, and you can't just 'fire' the 400~ employees in the French office - you need to lay them off."
pcgaming,"The jobs could still be 'saved' (they're still working that all out according to the article), but it's not likely that they'll remain in France. 

While I'm sure many employees will be offered a role elsewhere, it's not exactly conveinent for people to uproot and move to Ireland or whatever."
Games,"US-based employees were confirmed doing this, not the employees based in the French office featured in this story (though there's nothing to say that hasn't happened either).

Given the buzzword-salad served by the Blizzard spokesperson on why the office is being shut down, it's probably safe to assume they're just trying to cut costs or something. If that's the case then there's hope that these employees were getting paid what they're worth at least."
Games,"Ugh, I really, really wish the people in that story didn't conflate the terms ""laid off"" and ""fired"" together. At best it's extremely ignorant, and at worst it's intentially misleading.

I support the idea of raising awareness and efforts to unionize in the game development industry, but there's no need to use misinformation to get there is all."

Games,"> But if you want a Fallout experience , you know a RPG game that let you make your own character , don't force you to be any archtype , player choice above anything else and ending that actually show the effects your choices , Fallout 4 is anything but that.

The video goes into greater detail, but it makes the point that not only is Fallout 4 a game that lets you make your own character and promotes player choice in customizaton, it's probably the best in the Fallout series at it.

TLDR: There's no specific min/max build, there's no ""useless"" stats or OP stats (Agi in FO1/2), there's no cases of ""Leveling up"" without gaining any reward from doing so, the SPECIAL rebalance (Starting with 28 SPECIAL points instead of 40) adds a lot of rethinking/player choice to starting characters, there's far more perks available at any one time to choose + the option to forgo those and improve a SPECIAL stat instead...

Fallout 4 is far from a perfect game. But I'd say in that area it does very well in."

Games,"**Popup Dungeon** - I genuinely think this might be my GOTY by the end of the year. I've played it 98 hours so far and it only released just over a month ago.

On the surface it's a cool tabletop-y / roguelike thing that has a pretty in-depth set of mechanics. It's very easy to play well, but as more elements are added situations become trickier to manage.

Once you dive deeper, you'll see the best part of the game: The flavour. There's a ton of settings, from generic fantasy, to sci fi, contempary horror, fuedal Japan, and so on. The initial characters include a boring set of generic archtypes, but then through at you internet trolls, mute DJ's, gamblers who quote card game memes, and Max the GOOD BOY - every one of which designed in a thoughtful manner with a lot of effort put in. They aren't one-off jokes, but full characters that are incredibly interesting to play with.

A lot of the enemies are references/spoofs of well known characters/archetypes, with the same amount of effort put in, executed in an extremely flavourful way. It's hard to convey just how much this improves the experience, but you'll frequently run into an enemy that illicits a chuckle, then be impressed at just how their abilities and design are both faithful to the joke behind it, and work towards creating interesting experiences for the player. Any game can simply implement a ""Space Lincoln"" enemy, but few would be as successful as Popup Dungeon when it comes to giving him such a fitting role and ability set.

But lately I've spent a lot of time with the Steam Workshop features and ~~ripping off~~ creating totally original heroes. Popup Dungeon promotes the Steam Workshop to a ludicrous degree, with players being able to create entire heroes, enemies, abilities, game modes and more using the same tools the rest of the game was created by. It's incredibly satisfying to create ~~Blizzard's~~ your own hero and run with them and see them in action.

I'd strongly recommend it!"

Games,"> And every time they feel like they have to one up the previous expansion in terms of scope. So you end up fighting fucking aliens from space and completely killing old gods, titans and other shit.

In fairness, as early as Warcraft 1 you were fighting aliens from space and repelling titans.

There's definitely been scope creep when it comes to the story, but originally it wasn't very grounded either is me point."

Going first, assuming a full mulligan for nothing but Mountain Giant, you have roughly a 36% chance of finding at least one copy. Second, 46%.

After Mulligan, you'll draw 4 cards naturally by turn 4, and tap for two more. If you went first (So 27 cards in the deck starting at turn 1) and you didn't get it in the Mulligan, you have a 37% chance of drawing Mountain Giant. If you went second (26 cards in the deck), 41% chance.

Chance of not having Mountain Giant by Turn 4 going first: (1 - 0.36) * (1 - 0.37) = 0.4, roughly 40%. Going second, (1 - 0.46) * (1 - 0.41) is 32%.

Honestly those numbers are better then what I thought, but going first it's still a 60/40 on getting a Mountain Giant by turn 4, and near a two in three chance going second. But that's assuming you're full mulliganing."
hearthstone,"Handlock... has little RNG? Half the reason that deck exists is because of the power play you can make on turn 4, which is decided by essentially a coinflip (whether you draw Mountain Giant by turn 4). Mountain Giant was Keleseth long before Keleseth was a thing.

I get people getting frustrated at card generation and RNG. But I don't get it when people are frustrated by one but then go on to embrace the other."

Games,"Overwatch and Hearthstone both have genuine love, care and quality put into them. To claim that ""almost all of Blizzard's properties [are in] a tailspin"" while two of their most recent releases are still dominating their respective markets is at best reaching a bit. As for WoW, the fans have been non-stop complaining about the state of WoW for almost two decades. It's in a different place from where it started, but I wouldn't call it worse or better for that alone. The state of WoW as a whole has always sin-waved around a bit. What I'm getting at is that there's no absolute measure showing that WoW is failing. It's getting less popular, sure - but it's probably just safe to assume that games that are almost two decades old tend to do that.

The reason this kind of thinking is dangerous is because holding the old talent that high in regard tends to blind you to from seeing the new talent. Overwatch and Hearthstone both have popularized new voices from within Blizzard, and like it or not those games will likely be held high in regard in 30 years’ time, the same way we hold Warcraft, Diablo and Starcraft now - in no small part because of new talent.

As for your last point, Blizzard has never been known to release new IP's or projects often. If they started doing that now, that'd be far more 'anti-old Blizzard' then anything else they've done. As far how sacred 'old Blizzard' is, [I've said some things](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/iibrj1/you_now_need_an_ssd_to_play_world_of_warcrafts/g38gmc7/) about that in the past but my TLDR is that I'm also a staunch follower of Blizzard's work from the 90's to now and I absolutely believe the same Blizzard of the 90's would eventually go on to announce Diablo Immortal. Over time they've been given this weird reverence, but they were just another company doing company things - and made great games in the process."

pcgaming,"I'm not of the belief that WoW would have hit the heights it had without a subscription model (to fund the game's ongoing development and content), and a consolidated server infrastructures that's well maintained and administrated.

Most MMO's with a fixed price only model fail to output enough content to satisfy the MMO playerbase, and/or have quality issues with that content. I do not believe WoW would have faired much better in that regard.

Just to be perfectly clear: I 100% understand what PC Gaming was, and what it has become now. I understand you're not a fan of the various trends with the current state of PC Gaming, and that's fine. But I believe some of those trends are at least in part responsible for some of my best moments in PC Gaming. I'm not sure if PC Gaming is 'better' or 'worse' now then it was back in the day, but I'm happy with where we are - we are truly spoiled for choice compared to the 90's.

I cut my teeth on Doom WADs and building maps for Warcraft 2. As a teen/young adult in I spent more time then I'm willing to admit in the Warcraft 3 editor (And still do now, I've probably clocked 20-30 hours in the last week alone). I love level editors and modding tools, but that world has only expanded over the last 30 years. Modding a game has only gotten more accessible over time, and the only reason it sometimes seems like that isn't the case is because many modders have been able to move into indie game development - another thing that's bloomed massively in the last 30 years."

pcgaming,"These are player-built tools to help mod the game, not level editors supplied by the developer. If that's all that's needed to qualify, then by that definition PC Gaming absolutely has plenty of mod-friendly games that have ""level editors"", as most modding tools count as such, and are readily available for a plethora of games. 

There are some games today that aren't very mod friendly, or content mods aren't applicable/possible, but a)  that's always been the case (remember, Doom was built to be mod-friendly because of how mod-unfriendly Wolfenstein 3D was), and b) graphical fidelity, sound quality, game environments and level of detail in animation have all scaled dramatically over the last 30 years, and as a consequence it's harder then ever before for bedroom programmers to create quality content on-par with what's in the game already.

Were Diablo 3 made as a traditional single-player game it may have had mods, but not a full on (developer-supplied and supported) level editor, because Diablo 1 and 2 never did. There is literally no reason to expect otherwise - it was never a card on the table in the first place.

> You don't get that diablo 3 would have had level editing if gamers hadn't fallen for the mmo scam, when people picked up Ultima online, guild wars 1 and wow, that told the game industry to keep stealing games.

How you view the world is your business, you're absolutely entitled to your views. But I personally would much rather live in a gaming world that had classics like WoW, Guild Wars, and other games, vs a world where those experiences never existed. I gladly supported them at the time, and if another game like it comes along that's worth my time and money I'll gladly support it as well - and that's OK."

pcgaming,"Warcraft 1 didn't have a level editor (Though it did have a stat editor IIRC?) - Warcraft 2 did though. Doom (and Doom 2) didn't, they were just easily moddable. Also the vast majority of PC games in the 90's did *not* have a level editor, and they were *never* a standard, or on the cusp of being regarded as a standard.

Diablo 1 and 2 did not have level editors - I don't know a single person who was expecting Diablo 3 to have one. Starcraft 2 does have one, yet the maps in the arcade run on Battle.net servers owned by Blizzard (same with DotA 2's custom maps - they run on Valve servers, not your own PC), so the two concepts can absolutely co-exist.

Edit: Also worth pointing out that what exactly a ""level editor"" is is not clearly defined, and many level editors didn't really add much to the product because their functionality was limited. It's somehow correct to say that Warcraft 2, Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne all had level editors, but they all have *very* different levels of functionality built into them - so much so that putting them under the same label is incredibly misleading."
pcgaming,"I'd argue against the ""worser employee conditions"" part, at least compared to very early Blizzard (the war stories just sound like almost non-stop crunch at times). 

I don't think Blizzard of today are outdated or anything - I'd still rate their modern releases as ""above average"" in terms of quality/innovation at a bare minimum.  Setting aside WoW for the moment:

Heroes of the Storm: EOL, but still receiving content? ""End of Main Life”? With Blizzard having the transparency of a brick wall it's hard to tell if it was successful or failed (in the financial sense I mean), but it certainly never came close to overtaking DOTA or League. Still, I'd put it with Smite as ""The best MOBA that isn't DotA or League, and a very interesting take on the genre"". You can fault it for a lot of things, but it took risks and was genuinely innovative.

Hearthstone: Ongoing Titan. Far from left in the dust, they came out with a new game mode towards the end of last year (that going by content created, is about as popular as the main game mode itself) and have another scheduled in a months’ time. Over the last couple of years they've added a mini-content dump between each major expansion and also stepped up their storytelling game - last years ""Year of the Dragon"" storyline for me was more engaging and fun then BFA's main story (Maybe not the biggest hurdle, but for a card game that's still impressive).

Overwatch: Still going and seems to have an active community. The cast has been updated well enough since launch, and the core game rules have been rewired a few times to improve the game. Hard to say if it still is (or ever was) the Titan of its genre, but you wouldn't leave it out of a list of the best games in the TF2-shooter-thing games

Starcraft 2: Titan, but with the Asterix of no real competition (probably due to RTS consumer trends). Truth is a ton of RTS's have come out in the last 10 years, but none really on the scale of Wings of Liberty, so they certainly haven't had to innovate recently. TBH whether we're talking about Blizzard, CDPR, or EA I can't fault a business for not investing resources in a product that almost certainly won't have a worthwhile return.

Diablo 3: Yeah... I mean, it was great for a bit? But there's no hiding the fact that they failed to read the room when it came to what the market was expecting vs what they were making/updating/maintaining. Ironically the Blizzard we needed most for Diablo 3 may have been ""passionless, trend following corporate entity"" rather than whatever we got here.

As for (retail) WoW specifically, it just kinda sin-waves. TBH I think the team are doing their best keeping it alive and relevant, but the game itself just isn't meant to have gone this far out of scope - from a technical perspective, story perspective, and gameplay perspective.

Having said all that, I'm very happy games like League/Dota, Runeterra/MTG: Arena, every bloody MMO, Path of Exile and others exist. Choice and competition are never bad things."
pcgaming,"A hill I will die on is that Blizzard of the 90's absolutely made great, timeless games. But they were not a flawless company or some benevolent entity from which the Blizzard of today has since fallen from. They were flawed, they chased marketing trends, they had some sketchy tactics... They were not this weird perfect paragon of a company that some people seem to regard them as.

Warcraft: Orcs and Humans was basically ""Dune 2 came out but online multiplayer is starting to be a huge trend and Dune 2 doesn't have it. Ok go"".

Diablo was pitched, funded, and (for the majority of its development period) developed as a turn-based RPG - essentially a AAA Roguelike. But Blizzard pressured Blizzard North to turn it real-time, because marketing trends were showing that real-time games sell more. Blizzard North ended up complying, inventing the genre we now know today - not out of passion, but out of folding to demands from corporate (well, and probably *some* passion).

Speaking of Diablo, it had multiplayer (+ PvP) too, and that was pitched (with a MASSIVE carrot that Blizzard North were dangling infront of Blizzard's face) with the idea of releasing paid expansions which unlocked better gear, specifically so that the players who bought the most expansions were more powerful then the players who didn't (though this never came to pass, the only expansion released isn't compatible with battle.net).

WoW capitalized on the looming MMO trend that Everquest and DaoC (and to a lesser extent, Runescape) foreshadowed/jumpstarted. Starcraft: Ghost didn't. They dropped the project that didn't involving chasing trends and sales.

Maybe it's time to recognize that Blizzard today *is* the same company it was in the 90's. And maybe that's fine."
pcgaming,"Naa, this isn't censorship-related for once. It's purely bureaucracy, and while I enjoy blaming the ACB and/or Canberra for fucking up as much as the next guy, they didn't fuck up here - some third party that Paradox uses to organize this sort of thing did.

Games,"I haven't played that, but I have played Effect and Cause in Titanfall 2, which I understand to be basically the same system (though you're right in that it doesn't fall into either of my two ""dual worlds"" buckets).

I guess in that case it's only ever rendering one specific viewport at a time, which is enough of a difference to make it irrelevant to the patent. All assets for both worlds seem to be loaded, you can switch which viewport you're viewing on a dime, and the game can still process logic in the 'inactive' game world, but so long as there's only ever one viewport rendered in real time then it's not relevant to the patent in question.

This is why I mentioned it may be to specific to be problematic - so long as you have enough video memory to keep two worlds of assets loaded in video RAM at once, there's no real reason you *need* to render a second viewpoint to display a second world, even if it needs to be shown as soon as the next frame is created and pushed to the screen (And we've seen both these games do seamless transitions very well as proof of that). 

Since The Medium's implementation also requires every asset of both worlds to be loaded/available at short notice, there doesn't seem to be a functional difference in either the result or the requirements. The patent may honestly just be for marketing purposes - they can champion it as a ""genuine next-gen gameplay enhancing system"", even though it kinda isn't."
Games,"My (very limited) understanding of how that works is that patents can be filed, but should the owner enforce that patent on another company also implementing a dual-world system that other company can cite other games as a defence.

However, [the patent in question](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10500488B2/en?oq=20180207524) specifies more then just a dual-world scenario. Specifically, it patents the idea of rendering two seperate worlds in realtime in two seperate viewports (of which only one needs to be shown to the player). I don't know any dual-world games that would technically qualify against that particular definition (most have loading screens between transitions indicating assets are being loaded in/out to render the second world, or are blatently the same game world with extra effects added + a screen filter).

It also oddly specificies two seperate player-controlled characters exist, one for each world? Meaning that you might be able to do something similar and then dispute the patent on the grounds that your game only has one character duplicated across the two viewports? This may actually be related to that Chronos Twins game Bob called out in the video (Which appears to be the same character duplicated across two viewports, but I've never played it). If that's the case, then the patent may be too specific to realistically be problematic - though it's still somewhat hypocritical."

Games,"This was actually a huge issue I initially had with Dark Souls!

When I first started playing Dark Souls I was talking with friends about how I was finding even the 'easy' bosses hard, and eventually they realized that I had never even thought to block their attacks. It honestly never come across my mind that my shield (which was just a glorified ruler with three planks of wood taped to it) could block blows from weapons so big that may as well have been a Toyota Prius.

It's silly to think about in retrospect, but I still think it's horribly counter-intuitive, especially in a game that purposefully lacks obvious tells and prompts.

(I'm better at Dark Souls now and I fully admit blocking these bosses is usually not a *good* idea, it just came up at the time as an option)"

pcgaming,"I don't choose to have a shit connection. I have the 'best' plan my ISP (or rival ISP's) can offer me, outside of the data limit. Anything better would involve either switching to a 4G solution (Which would double or triple my monthly cost atleast, and I'm already paying $100~ AUS a month), or moving house (which would cost at least several thousand dollars for various reasons, plus be massively stressful/inconvenient). I'm stuck with what I have for now.

I absolutely, 100% realize that these problems are only for people with slow internet - I never claimed otherwise. But that doesn't invalidate my points, and it's completely fine for myself (or the person you initially replied to) to voice support for a practice that's a net gain for us. It's completely logical in my current situation to support the promotion of preloading if DRM is the cost of that. If that (plus everyone else's voice on the matter) results in genuine change then that's fine too - that's just how these things happen.

It's OK to find someone elses solution to a problem you don't have to be irritating to yourself. It's not OK to invalidate that other person's opinion simply because you don't like it yourself."
Games,"Please don't use disparaging and offensive language for things you don't agree with. Comments like this will be removed. Consistent usage may invite further consequences, such as a temporary subreddit ban."
pcgaming,"> Some DRM is super intursive (like Denuvo.)

This is subjective, but for me Denuvo is one of the least intrusive forms of DRM. The most intrusive would be Online-only (Like AC2 and the like), but even then games that require me to keep a game manual or CD key around for reinstallation is still more bothersome then Denuvo's requirements.

> I'd rather wait the extra hour or two to download the game on release day and have a better overall product forever.

For many of us, that wait is measured in days, not hours. The wait itself isn't even a problem - I'm very, very used to scheduling downloads over night and trying to squeeze every bit from my bandwidth/data cap. But not being able to do anything while it's happening? No watching a stream on the side, or YouTube videos buffering every 5 seconds, or throwing the internet off for my partner to be unable to watch Netflix or use for social media? Having to manage all of that happening on and off over three~ days? That's the shit part. More ways to manage the download (such as pre-loading) helps mitigate that *a ton*.

It's possible for pre-load as a feature to work alongside a DRM-free game (to some extent), but it's certainly not common. If the cost for preloading to become common is something like Denuvo, then for me that's worth it.

Again, it's all subjective - it's OK to disagree. It's just not black and white is all."
hearthstone,"Tempostorm's meta snapsnot is a snapshot of the top 100 (or top 1000, I forget which) legend meta, which is usually not always representative of the meta as a whole.

HS Replay's data actually lists Libram Paladin with a 48.3% winrate when only using data from the top 1000 legend players (though without that filter it's 62%, and using statistics pulled from all Legend players is still 61.2%, lol). To get that feature you need the Premium version I think though, so you might not see it.

There's a few reasons why the two stats could be so far apart yet still make sense. Libram Pally could be easier to build optimally for new players w/ limited collections vs another player with a half-built deck, or it could be super easy for an experienced player to effectively counter. It could be easier to pilot effectively with less room for error vs the 'average' deck, or maybe it just has better matchups against decks commonly seen in low-mid MMR matchups but not in super high MMR matchups.

Another interesting point is that Firebat pointed out on stream that Paladin has had the least amount of success in Tourney play - but I don't have the clip on hand to reference nor any data points to support it. Still I trust his judgement of the tourny meta read over my own. Since LHS/Conquest/Specialist are all different game modes compared to average ladder play that usually doesn't mean that much ladder-wise, but historically the best tourny decks have usually drawn from the better ladder decks at the time, with a few cards swapped out for tech choices/tourny meta reads.

Edit: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/nY4ndGh) is what I'm seeing with that ""Top 1000 legend"" filter. Note the low game count as well, so the data may not be very reliable (But it's consistent with Tempostorm's meta snapshot)."

Games,"IMO it seems the ""outrage"" industry is getting stronger and louder. Youtubers, streamers and content creators whose content depends on creating and echoing outrage and controversy just seems to be more influential now then ever, and this bleeds into how a lot of games/news/events are perceived. People were suddenly more critical of TLOU2 after seeing 5-6 trusted content creators slam it, for example.

It's a somewhat alarming trend TBH. I'm not against people being upset by news or decisions made by developers, but it seems like a powerful way to influence people all the same."

These types of warnings are effective. Game ESRB/ACB labels are trusted by parents or customers who themselves aren't following the games industry enough to understand at a glance what to expect from a product.

Also, this is veering slightly off-topic, but those same cigarette warnings are *also* effective.
