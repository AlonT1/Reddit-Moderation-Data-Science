DankLeft,"I don't usually use forums or Reddit, I usually just post comments on Ancap blogs like Molyneux or Cantwell's blog, but they didn't seem appropriate places to post my story. So here goes, I just wanted to share this with all of you.

Nov 3 I flew to Europe for a Eurotrip type tour. Not a guide or packaged deal, just going around by myself. I paid for half of the trip with the wages I earned over the last two years, my dad paid for the other half. I am 19, I guess that is normal starting college and all. (Before that I worked for my dad's company part time, so I guess you could say he paid for all of it, lol).

I did France and then Italy and then Greece next. I am an Ancap so I wanted to see anarchists in these places. Yes, I know they are different kinds of ""anarchists"" and not really full anarchists like us. I went to an anarchist book store in Italy and it had a lot of English books, but no Rothbard or Ancap. Like I said, I expected that, not a surprise.

I went to Greece, which everyone knows is famous for its revolutionary anarchism, its economic crisis and everything going on right now. Here I found directions for a local anarchist center. I went and didn't see anybody, but it was covered in graffiti, mostly in Greek so I couldn't read it. Whatever, I started taking pictures. Then some people came out and confronted me.

This should have been my first warning sign something was not right, because photography is not a crime. They were not violent, but they were not friendly, like asking who I was, what I wanted. They all spoke good English actually. Not uncommon in Greece. I said I was a tourist and an anarchist and I just wanted to take pictures. Then they got friendly and told me I should have asked first (but pictures are no NAP violation so I don't know why, but I didn't say anything) and they invited me inside.

We hung out for a while and smoked hash (there is no good dank in Europe as you might find out like in Cali, everyone smokes hash with tobacco which isn't as cool as it sounds). We started talking about politics and anarchism. I was trying to talk about the state, they were like yeah no doubt the state was bad. But they wanted to talk about capitalism, capitalism this and that. This is when we started to get into a debate.

I told them that what they called capitalism is different from the free market. They said capitalism is free markets. And I said I agreed. That is what I am saying. Real capitalism is free markets. And they said yes, that is what we are trying to get rid of. And I said no, but we don't even have that right now. We need more free markets. And everyone at the same time was like ""nooo"" we are anarchists, we are against capitalism. Anarchists oppose capitalism.

And I said but not anarcho-capitalists. Anarcho-capitalists are the anarchists who support capitalism. I had a fanny pack (yeah, lame I know) for my camera and in that I had this yellow and black bowtie (also super lame, it was a joke but I wasnt wearing it). And I said look, these are the Ancap colors, yellow and black, like versus the communist red and black. Well, these guys had a lot of red and black in the building already so I thought they would get it.

I think that is when it started to get a really bad vibe, really tense in the air. The free market thing was funny, we disagreed but I think they thought I was just confused. Everyone was uncomfortable now. Then someone said markets wont work with democracy. And I said exactly, that's it, democracy is against anarchism. And they kind of agreed, and said yes, we don't have real democracy, just governments, and we needed more democracy. I said no, we need less democracy, democracy is the enemy. And we need to end democracy to have anarchy. Then they were all like ""noooo"" again. You know that thing people do in groups when everyone all says ""nooo"" or expresses some disapproval at the same time.

And one of them said ""but we do want to stop democracy"" and then they kind of spoke back and forth in Greek. I didn't really understand it. And they asked me what I meant.

So I said okay, I had the floor, I was going to tell them about ancapism. And I tried to explain to them some Rothbard and Hoppe. I said the natural order in anarchy is that the best rise to the top, the market picks who is the best. They compete and are peaceful. They said what do we want instead of anarchy. I said we want private owners to own their own land and businesses, and to employ people. They said that is what we have now. I said no, it would be even better. One of the guys said it was like feudalism. And I said it is not feudalism.

Eventually one of the guys spoke up and I thought he was Greek, but he spoke English perfectly so he may have not been. He said he knew what anarcho-capitalism was and that we were basically fascists. He asked me if I thought everything should be private. And I said yes. And he asked me if I thought people were unequal. And I told him yes. And that not everyone would have equal rights. I said everyone has the right to own property and not be done aggression against. But that not everyone had to be treated equally by the owners. He said what about immigrants and racism. And I said that would not happen in a free market, but yes property owners could be racist if they wanted to. They had to respect property.

Then he called me a fascist again, and someone else said I was a fascist. And then they basically all started shouting fascist at me, and one of them grabbed me by the wrists. They pulled me out the door, it was up three floors, and basically drug me down the stairs on my back. It hurt really bad and I remember yelling ""you're breaking the NAP"" and things like that. ""Stop initiating force against me."" Then they kicked me around on the ground in the hallway, before they took my camera and threw me outside. I was crying and stuff, I just sat there. I was in shock because it was so sudden. Looking back there were warning signs though.

I think they felt bad for me and gave the camera back, but when I looked later they stole the memory card with all of my Greek photos.

So they initiated force and theft. They broke the NAP. I knew the left anarchists were not real anarchists, but I never knew they would do something that bad.

I wasnt seriously hurt, just kicked around a little, lots of bruises and little cuts. I am fine guys so don't worry. Just needed to share."

Some really stellar tracks on it, the guest vocalists are all phenomenal, and it truly feels like yet another evolution from the band. It’s a gorgeous album perfect for the present fall and winter seasons imo."
movies,"It doesn’t, but I think she’s someone that happens to be good at both. She’s hold her own in Moonlight, a movie filled with phenomenal, naturalistic performances. She also made the most of the material in Hidden Figures, playing that role as best as one could. Can’t attest to her in Harriet, but by all accounts I’ve heard no complaints. She’s just as good, if not better than Justin Timberlake, and people are fine with him generally."

giantbomb,"I saw Jeff at a grocery store in Boston yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen energy drinks in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the cans and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each can and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

Edit: In all seriousness, I saw Dan interact with some fans a few Pax Easts ago and he seemed like such a sweetheart. I also recall seeing Jeff and Ryan at the airport leaving Pax East and being awestruck. They seemed super chill with the people who recognized them too. "
indieheads,I saw it and I disagree! I feel like he was constrained enough by the mandate of having to stick close to the source material that that Sorkinisms only really popped with those changes they made from the original. I think The Newsroom is still the most Sorkin thing ever.

Broadway,"According to the New York Post (which one should take with a grain of salt, of course), the show is supposed to transfer actually!

And as a person who’s seen the show three times, I’d say the harmonies are more Barber Shop Quartet than Andrews sisters in this production, just a warning. I love what they did with it though! "
Games,"Hmm. I think you should definitely play through Steins;Gate since you played Danganronpa and the Zero Escape series. If you enjoyed those and the wild ride the story takes you and the diverse cast of characters, you’ll love S;G.

As to which version to buy, that’s totally up to you and your preferences. If you want a more animated version with less interesting art, get this new one coming out. If you want one less animated but with great art and with cheaper art, just by the old version. Either way, you’re gonna have a great time I think. "
Games,"Yeah, if you’re not familiar it won’t mean much at first. However, I think it’s the type of thing that once you start playing, you’ll remember seeing things in the trailer and be like “oh yeah I saw this I think I know where this is going” and things to that extent. 

Just a VN, yeah. There are some choices you make that impact the endings you get. It’s a game that has a few endings and a true ending. "
Games,"Oh I definitely don’t disagree. The art of the original is one of the things that won me over originally. But honestly, the game would be great even if all the art was done with stick figures. It’s the voice acting, music, and most especially the writing that make the game so special. The anime art style is a step down for sure, but this release still presents those unfamiliar with the original story or those who haven’t experienced the story in a long time a new and easier way to get through it. "
Games,"From what I understand, it’s the VN except they took out all the original art and videos and put in the anime stuff in its place. There is no remaining presence of the original art from the VN. They’ve also animated new stuff for all the things that weren’t in the anime but where in the VN, like the character endings and extended scenes. "
Games,"Not sure which thread is going to stay up so I'm reposting my comment here:

&#x200B;

As someone who has played the original VN and watched the anime several times, I'm going to be that guy and say that if you want to go in blind playing this version, maybe skip this trailer. It doesn't really spoil anything too significantly and this game is definitely one about the journey not the destination (or multiple destinations in this case), but there are some things in the trailer that stood out to me as things that stood out to me the first time I experienced the story and was glad to not have known. Either way, if you were hesitant to play this game before, this is probably the most accessible way there has ever been to go through it."

hiphopheads,"I believe the reason this stuff upsets people is because it can come off as both exploitive of a culture you don’t belong to as well as being a means to more so string up controversy rather than offer any meaningful perspective. 

The situation kinda reminds me of the Open Casket painting controversy. Essentially, the Whitney showcased a painting by a white artist depicting the severely damaged dead face of Emmitt Till. People were upset because they felt like a white woman shouldn’t be the person to capitalize and comment off of a tragedy against an African American kid. Some thought it was just controversy bait as well since it didn’t really say anything about the issue. 

Drake’s picture is controversial and arguably misguided because there are better people qualified than a a mixed race Canadian to comment on a problem that predominantly affected African-Americans in the United States. Additionally his picture doesn’t really offer anything enlightening or new or intelligent on the subject, so it only comes off as even more questionable and misguided. "
hiphopheads,"Yet again, it was another late, sleepless night in Atlanta. The studio was packed, yet intimate all at the same time. Warm amber lights washed over exotic leather furniture, creating a dimly lit sonic oasis. A sweet aroma of weed smoke clouded the air, while vanilla scented candles were strategically placed around the room. The mood developed into a haze of relaxation. As engineers and producers methodically worked the mixing boards, Future and the rest of his entourage nodded along to a rough take of a track that would later be called ""Diamonds Dancing."" Many individuals in the studio danced along while producers ran the track back, but there stood Drake in a dark corner, dissecting every piece of ""Diamonds Dancing"" with surgical precision. The track stopped playing, and Drake stepped from the shadows. He didn't speak much, but when he did, people listened.

""I'm going back in the booth, play that outro back.""

Puzzled, the engineer began playing the outro instrumental back, not questioning Drake's demands. The room fell quiet as people began to observe. As the outro began to play, Drake put on a pair of monitor headphones, rubbed his beard and began to take a drink of a dark, murky substance. Closing his eyes, Drake began to flow freely.

""You doin' me dirty, you know. How we let it get like this I don't know. But that nigga can't save your soul, nah."" Producers and entourage members in the studio began to look around the room to see if others were witnessing what was happening. Drake continued crooning into the microphone, while the mood became even darker in the studio.

""Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty. Haven't even heard from you. How can you live with yourself? Haven't even heard from you. How can you live with yourself? Ungrateful, ungrateful."" The Engineer looked over to Future with concern. The engineer whispered, ""should we stop him?"" Future then put up one finger, as to silence the engineer while shaking his head, not taking his eyes off of Drake.

""Your momma be ashamed of you. I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you, Ungrateful. I'm too good for you, too good for you. You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable."" Candles in the studio began to flicker and die out, one by one, as if a spirit swept throughout the room.

""Doing me dirty. You're making me nervous. I haven't even heard from you. You look drained, you look exhausted, girl them late nights ain't good for you. Really starting to show on you. Don't hit me up when it's good for you. Ungrateful."" By now, everyone had stopped what they were doing, all attention was focused on the darkened silhouette in the recording booth. Finishing up his final thoughts, Drake hung up the headphones, took another sip of muddy water, and crept out of the recording booth.

As he came back into the studio, all eyes followed his every movement. Drake retreated back to his shadowed corner, where he leaned against the wall with his fingers interlocked and pressed against his lips, as if in deep thought. The silence of the room created an uneasy tension. The uneasiness built more and more, as studio members waited for him to speak. Finally, he broke the silence.

""Play it back."" "

indieheads,"In regards to the NY show, it isn't completely impossible to get tickets anymore. If you get there early enough and wait the cancellation line, you're pretty much guaranteed tickets. And for face value, no less! 

It's still not as straightforward as simply buying tickets online and not having to worry, but it's a non soul-selly way to see the show. Just requires free time and patience. "
indieheads,"I can attest to the whole ""better than the album leads you to believe"" thing. I wasn't a huge fan of the cast recording, but I was completely blown away by it when I saw it in NY recently. I went from skeptical and cynical to in love with the production within three songs. It lives up to the hype completely in my opinion. While nothing will top Sweeney Todd in my eyes, Hamilton has become one of my favorites. "
indieheads,"NYU! I recommend it to people who wanna experience New York and finish your undergrad in a lot debt! The school is liberal as hell but accepts all beliefs. School spirit isn't really a thing and making friends is something that you have to actively pursue. However, it's in a popping area, the education is solid, and you have a lot of opportunities to explore the city through the school. I've really enjoyed my time so far. "

indieheads,"Saw LCD Soundsystem in Bonnaroo and it was honestly one of the best sets I've ever seen. It's the most emotional a show has ever left me. 

I also bought VIP tickets for Kanye at MSG in New York as well as tickets for James Blake at Radio City Music Hall. I'm quite tempted on buying tickets for Roots Picnic in New York since the lineup is pretty solid. "

tipofmytongue,"Definitely isn't DOOM, because I'm a huge fan of his. Could possibly be Madlib, I'll check ASAP."
tipofmytongue,"Yeah, I've used whosampled before. The thing is, I have no idea where the samples are from. Like, they sound like they could've been from cheesy movies or TV shows, but I'm not 100% sure. It sucks, because that album was pretty rad sounding! "
tipofmytongue,It definitely isn't Entroducing. I've heard that album enough to rule that out. 
hiphopheads,"Posted this somewhere else, but had no luck. I'll try again here:

Alright, so I heard an instrumental hip hop album the other day that I can't identity. I can remember this about it: there's a sample that plays that goes ""well, you got me there I'm a traitor"", there's a song that has talk about the media, there's a song that has a sample mentioning the new world order, and there's a sample that brings up you having picked up this album. It was only instrumentals and samples, not rapping from what I remember. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? "

It was only instrumentals and samples, not rapping from what I remember. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? "
indieheads,"Happy to hear you enjoyed it some! It's definitely not a perfect album as you pointed out, but it's a fun and easy listen. Northern Downpour is a gorgeous song, so I pretty much agree with you there. "
indieheads,"Like I said, I acknowledge that Pretty Odd is super rip-offy and derivative, but it rips off a sound that I think holds up better and that I'd rather hear. Not only that, but to my knowledge they moved towards a sound that their counterparts weren't necessarily flocking towards, which was a bit refreshing (as refreshing as a homage to the Beatles can be). There's just a joy and happiness to that album that their debut doesn't have. I'd probably be able to get behind Fever a little more if it wasn't so whiney and melancholy. 

But yeah, it was cool to be able to discuss a band I used to be really into! I'll probably give Pretty Odd another spin today. "
indieheads,"Overall I think their sound throughout that album sounds like stuff by bands like Hellogoodbye and Fall Out Boy. In regards to finding songs that sound exactly like the ones you pointed out, I'd say look to the stuff from the two bands I just mentioned. It's not exact, but it's still samey enough that'd I'd claim blandness. 

Also, it's pretty much impossible to objectively say if one song is better than another, so I won't sit here listing songs in order to prove my point. Personally speaking, I enjoy all the singles off of Pretty Odd a lot more than anything off of their debut. "
indieheads,"I think AFYCSO is more appealing to a teenager because of its angst and the band's image at the time. However, (for me at least) you come to notice that the album is a hodgepodge of sounds and clichés from that time in music and it doesn't really sound all that great. It's messy and scatterbrained. 

Pretty Odd I think can be more easily appreciated by someone who's not a teenager. It's also pretty cliché, but I'd say it's cliché in the sense that it's borrowing from a sound that holds up well. The album feels like a love letter to The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and other similar bands from that era. It's charming and colorful, as opposed to their first album, which was angsty and bland. "
indieheads,"I partially agree with you. They did get progressively worse, but I'd say the decline started after their second album. Their second album, derivative as it is, is easily better than their first. It holds up way better. Their first album, while kinda enjoyable, doesn't really hold up so much. "
indieheads,"[Colors by Sport](https://sport.bandcamp.com/album/colors)

indieheads,"Either Malibu, Untitled Unmastered, or No Burden. "
House,"It's on Spotify right now. Pitchfork recently did a review on it; they gave it best new music. 

Personally, I think it's pretty good. Very relaxing with a diverse song choice. "
indieheads,"Two bigger entirely exclusive to Vita games that have come out since then are Freedom Wars and Persona 4: Dancing All Night. Freedom Wars is a Monster Hunter clone that many people dig. Persona 4: Dancing All Night is a rhythm game akin to the Hatsune Miku games staring the cast of Persona 4. 

Some not strictly exclusive to Vita (but still only found on Sony consoles) games include Steins;Gate and the Danganronpa series. Steins;Gate is a great sci-fi visual novel and Danganronpa is kinda like Phoenix Wright meets 999. "
indieheads,"In regards to sports games, the Vita is mostly a wasteland of low quality ports. In regards to adventure games, the Vita has several ports of the bigger adventure games to come out recently. There are a few kart racers, but not that many. 

Basically, if you enjoy visual novels, ports of indie games, replaying old PS and PSP games, and JRPGS, then the Vita is an amazing purchase, made better by the ownership of PS+. If you're into other stuff than I just mentioned, maybe look elsewhere. 

For the right price, I believe the Vita is absolutely worth it. I've sunken in countless hours into the Vita version of Spelunky and Persona 4. Honestly, I'd recommend the Vita just for Persona 4 Golden. But do keep in mind, once you buy a Vita, you'll also have to sink in money for a memory card, which can be pricey as hell. "
indieheads,"I absolutely adore my Vita, but it's definitely not for everyone. What kind of games are you into? "
indieheads,Accepted into and will be attending NYU. Hooray for crippling debt!

hiphopheads,"Does anyone have a link to that high quality version of Flockaveli 1.5? I remember someone posting about a WAV or a FLAC version, but I haven't been able to find the post since then. "
indieheads,"That looks nothing like him in my opinion. So I'll put money on that not being him. However, I do concede that I have nothing to back up my opinion, so I may very well be wrong. "
Downwell,"Every time you get a health refill while your health is already full, that four bar ticks up. Once it's ticked up all the way, your overall HP goes up by one. "
indieheads,"You may be right. I just think it's an album you'll appreciate most if you're well-versed with funk, jazz, and hip-hop as a whole."
indieheads,"Nowadays, it's arguable whether there's a stylistic distinction between the coasts because artists from both coasts tend to break conventions associated with each coast. However, in the past I'd definitely say there were stylistic differences. For example, boom-bap tended to be associated with the East while g-funk was associated with the West. There's a lot of other differences that one could talk about, but I don't think I'd be able to explain it in a cohesive way. You'll definitely notice the differences yourself once you get into music from both coasts. "
indieheads,"Definitely. Production-wise, it sounds typical to most mainstream rap to come out of the West Coast nowadays (not a bad thing at all). Thematically speaking, it's a less intense and more straightforward as well. So yeah, that's a good one to start off with for sure. 

If you've got any more questions regarding hip-hop, I've got your back and will happily answer them for you! I love recommending stuff to people. Also check out r/hiphopheads if you haven't already. There's a sizable overlap in users of that sub and this one, so you'll probably feel right at home. "
indieheads,"I'd say maybe wait a little while before revisiting TPAB. I won't say that it's the most unapproachable and abstract album in the world, but at the same time it can come off as a bit daunting for those either not really into hip-hop or the various genres that influenced that album. "
hiphopheads,"How is it overrated? Critically speaking, it was only received decently (it only has a 64 on Metacritic). Maybe on this sub it is, but even then I wouldn't say it's too heavily adored here. "
hiphopheads,I think Tales From The Land Of Milk And Honey by The Foreign Exchange was definitely glossed over by many. That album is the closest they've been to reaching the level of quality found in their album Connected. 
giantbomb,"Surströmming isn't too bad actually, if prepared properly. "

Keep in mind, this is totally subjective, and that both albums are most listens. I also left off Interstate 8, since I'm not as familiar with it compared to their core releases. "
indieheads,"I feel like Mark Hollis would be an interesting guy to talk to do. He's been a part of two of my favorite albums ever, so I'd love to hear if he had anything to say about them. I'd just be happy to hear a little more about him though. "
indieheads,I'm surprised no one has brought up this one yet: [Deafheaven - New Bermuda](http://imgur.com/WybmzjA) . Great art for a great album. Totally encapsulates the sound of the album. 
hiphopheads,"As brief as the review was, I think it does a good job at capturing how I feel about the album. The album was definitely an interesting listen, and it had some decent high points, but overall it felt a bit lackluster. However, I'll still give Raury a lot of credit for carving his own sound out. It's just a matter of time until he completely nails it. "
hiphopheads,"Lucky for this guy (and I suppose everyone else who bought tickets), supposedly he's gotten a lot better at performing. I saw him open for Kanye in Miami and I thought it was decent enough, so any improvement since then should mean good things. "
indieheads,Sweet! Congratulations then! 
indieheads,Whatcha gonna be doing? 
indieheads,"Great video for a great song. Really excited for the new album. Impersonator is one of my favorite albums from recent years. 

Also, if you ever have the chance, see these guys live. I saw them open for Grizzly Bear in Miami, and it remains one of my favorite live sets. Their music is even more mesmerizing and powerful live. "

hiphopheads,"Because it's a ""funny"" way of expressing excitement. I don't think it is, but shit like that gets upvoted all the time on this sub. "
hiphopheads,A loss. 
hiphopheads,"You'll probably get a longer and more intimate set from an actual tour date rather than a festival performance. That's not to say that he'd perform badly at the festival or anything like that, but it may be a more enjoyable experience seeing him at venue filled with only his fans rather than some randies at a festival. "
indieheads,"I saw him open for St. Vincent. He did an acoustic set that was really solid. I will say this though, you may come out of his performance thinking every song he performed went on a bit too long. Things can get a bit repetitive and samey. Still,  I enjoyed myself. "

Also, you a bigger fan of his solo stuff or his stuff with AC? "

This may be a dumb question, but does he ever play any Animal Collective stuff? "

Also, is Panda Bear any good live? "

hiphopheads,"To add on to what he's saying, really any Aphex Twin project is great. I've always been a huge fan of Selected Ambient Works Volume II. "
hiphopheads,What were you disappointed by? 
indieheads,"I'm skeptical because it's DOOM. He has a tendency to not show up to shows. Also, I'm pretty sure he's not even allowed in the US anymore. It doesn't help that it has that little ""live from another time"" thing next to it. It leads me to believe he actually isn't going to be there in person. "
indieheads,"Bought my tickets to this a while back. Decent lineup considering the ticket price. 

I'm still super skeptical about DOOM being there though. "
hiphopheads,"I'll be there too! I saw Run the Jewels down here when they opened for Pretty Lights. They put on a great show, even though the crowd wasn't too into it. "
hiphopheads,"I saw that! I'm skeptical though, knowing DOOM's track record. Also, the fact that it days ""live from the other side of time"" makes me think that there's a catch to this. "
hiphopheads,"What I was attempting to point out is that if you add the points you wanted to every hip-hop review, you'd end up with some ridiculous scores. And besides, if you're adding it to every hip-hop review, doesn't it defeat the purpose? You're not accurately representing the lower rated albums then, you're just adjusting the scale in a meaningless way. "
hiphopheads,"So MBDTF is a 11.5/10? Yeezus is an 11/10?

Well, whatever works for you bruh. Their reviews are pretty competent, and you shouldn't be focusing on the numeric score either. "
hiphopheads,"I'm not going, but it should be a good show I think. I've gone to see SBTRKT do both a DJ set and a live set, and they were both really solid. "
hiphopheads,"I would disagree with that. I feel like NOTM is way more consistent, and the onslaught of Bjork samples is really interesting. "
silenthill,"I'd say Silent Hill is essential to play before playing Silent Hill 3, since that game is basically a direct sequel to the original. It holds up pretty well and has some good scares. The soundtrack is stellar as always. 

Silent Hill 2 you can play without any context, and is in my opinion the best of the series. 

Homecoming has great music, but the game is rather awful. Downpour is slightly better, but still isn't great.

Just my extra two cents: Play Silent Hill 4 and Shattered Memories eventually. 4 is messy, but the story, music, and atmosphere is good as always. Shattered Memories is a reimagining of the first Silent Hill, and is pretty great too. 

I have no opinion on Origins, since I've always heard it's mediocre. 

You're in for a good time bud, enjoy! Lord knows I wish I could do a virgin run of these games again. "

hiphopheads,"I'd say that ""Thriller"" is the white man's ""Thriller"", but I see what you're going for and agree. Timberlake is the shit. "
hiphopheads,"While it didn't necessarily get me into the genre (I was a fan of it before), hip-hop as of late has led to a resurgence in my interest in funk music. I remember wanting to re-listen to the Super Fly soundtrack after I heard TPAB. "
hiphopheads,"I'd say FutureSex/LoveSounds is up there. Great project overall. The beats to SexyBack and My Love are crazy, and those tracks are destined be remembered as some of the better pop songs of the 2000s."
hiphopheads,"I think Hurt Me Soul is the more impressive song in terms of technical ability and rhyme scheme, while Sing About Me/Dyin' of Thirst has a bigger emotional impact. So if I had to choose, I'd probably go with Hurt Me Soul. The beat to that song is just too nice. 

Sing About Me/Dyin' of Thirst is still excellent though. I'm just more inclined to listen to Hurt Me Soul, especially since it isn't nine minutes long. "
hiphopheads,"That was really nice actually! Thanks for the recommendation, you've definitely peaked my interest. "
hiphopheads,"What musicals have you seen, and why didn't you like them? "
hiphopheads,"Are any of y'all into musicals? If so, what are your favorites? Also, are any of you aware of any musicals that usually aren't too widely discussed yet are still really great? 

To answer my first question, I fucking adore Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's such a strangely fun mess. "
Games,"If you're a fan how it plays, yes. The game gives you various side-ops to complete after the story mission is complete, all of which are pretty fun and enjoyable. The game also offers incentives such as audio logs and other items for completing missions multiple times and on harder difficulties Finally, the game is designed around besting yourself every chance you have, keeping track of things such as longest headshot, farthest distance a body a thrown, and scores at the end of the mission.

So while a lot of the game's replay value comes from what you're willing to put into the game, I'd say the base content is substantial enough that it's worth the free download. 

I think it's worth mentioning that all of this applies only if you're familiar with the Metal Gear franchise. It probably isn't worth checking out if you've never played a Metal Gear game, but I'll leave that up to someone else."
hiphopheads,"So on the album Take Me to Your Leader, there's a track called Lockjaw featuring a rapper called Trunks. Does anyone know anything about the guy and his music? Does he have anything worth checking out, or anything at all to check out? I read once that he has an EP that got leaked and then scrapped or something like that, but couldn't find much else. "
hiphopheads,"Yeah, that's true. At the same time, didn't the single version only include the 0 to 100, and not the beat switch-up part? I could just be remembering incorrectly, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I coulda sworn that was the case. Or at least that was the case here in South Florida. "
hiphopheads,"That's why I specified that the biggest tracks didn't have them. Started From The Bottom and Hold On, We're Going Home definitely didn't have them. Neither did All Me. 

I'm just saying that he doesn't do it enough and isn't known for them enough to be thrown into the conversation of those that are the best at switch-ups. I won't deny that he does them well. "

Cherry Bomb is such a strange album. I kinda dig it though. Smuckers is one of my favorite songs of the year. You're right about it not being better than Wolf. "
Games,You definitely should man. Kendrick's album is one that rightfully deserves all the praise it's received. And We're New Here is a super creative and dancy take on its source material (which in itself is a fantastic album). 
Games,"Just wanted to put an extra shoutout in there. 

I've seen that Young Fathers' album recommended a bunch, I really ought to give it a spin. 

God, this year has been so excellent so far that it's hard to choose. Immediate standouts for me are Lupe Fiasco's Tetsuo and Youth and Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly. I'm not all the way through it, but Kamasi Washington's The Epic has been great so far as well. 

I'm hyped for that Jamie XX album too, We're New Here is one of my favorite remix albums ever. I'm extra hyped for Frank Ocean's new album and Kanye's album if he drops it. "
Games,"I generally enjoy most music genres, but I'm most into indie rock, hip-hop, and electronic music. If you're into the first two, check out r/hiphopheads and r/indieheads. I'm also huge onto jazz (r/Jazz could definitely use some more love too). 

What's your album of the year so far? "
indieheads,"I think Pretty Odd by Panic At the Disco is a super enjoyable and fun album. It's very derivative of the Beach Boys and Beatles, but it's bright and colorful enough that it stands on its own. "
indieheads,That's dope. How were they? 
indieheads,"I saw Tyler the Creator last Sunday and it was a pretty mediocre experience. The sound was super shitty (you could hardly hear Tyler) and his set was super short, completely avoiding an encore. However I must say, Tyler brought a lot of energy and the crowd wasn't as bad and obnoxious as people describe Odd Future fans to be. Overall, I'd probably see him again if it was cheap and at a different venue.

This weekend I'm going to Sunfest on Saturday and Earl Sweatshirt on Sunday. The lineup for Saturday includes Schoolboy Q and Damien Marley. Should be exciting.

Next Wednesday I'm going with a friend to see Neutral Milk Hotel. I'm expecting an amazing show, and I'm glad that they decided to include South Florida in their itinerary. If their setlist is at all similar to recent ones, I expect to cry my eyes out.

I have Death Grips coming up in July, and I'm waiting for III Points to announce their festival lineup as well. Hoping to fit in Between the Buried and Me and Nicki Minaj during the summer, but I'll probably be too busy working.

EDIT: Earl postponed, so I guess I won't be seeing him till September. "
indieheads,"Florida seems to be painfully neglected when it comes to indie artists coming. Especially down here in Miami. The fact that tune-yards was down here the other day surprised the shit out of me. But then again, I'm not gonna go ahead and claim we have it the worst. "
hiphopheads,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought lossless streaming was $20?

EDIT: [Yup, it's $20]( https://tidalsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201745891-How-much-does-TIDAL-cost-)"
hiphopheads,"Like the others have said, it's definitely a great place to start. A lot of their shit is super solid, so I don't think you'll ever have to worry about encountering truly awful Public Enemy music.  "
hiphopheads,"Awesome, I haven't heard of most of these. I'll check them out when I have the chance. Thanks!"
hiphopheads,I love Little Brother. The Minstrel Show is one of my go-to albums to recommend to people. Thanks for the suggestion though! 
hiphopheads,"You guys know of anything that sounds similar to Connected by The Foreign Exchange? I'm open to all suggestions, but you can probably refrain from mentioning anyone that's super mainstream or common sense. "
hiphopheads,"Cliché answer, but mine is It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back by Public Enemy. It's their best album and is basically the rap equivalent of What's Going On?, one of my all time favorite albums. "
hiphopheads,"They has appeal to people who don't exclusively listen to hip-hop. They're a sum of their parts kind of band. They aren't necessarily the best in regards to every individual aspect of their sound, but since it's a lot of aspects not frequently seen together, it makes for a unique and interesting experience. They have the energy of a punk band combined with rapping and the appeal of an indie band."
indieheads,"To anyone that's actually seen them live, how is Death Grips' live show? Got my ticket for them in ATL recently. "
hiphopheads,"I suppose that's one of the interesting things about BLACKIE, his sound is really all over the places and he usually tackles a new sound with each release. "
hiphopheads,"GEN by BLACKIE is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. It has the feel and vocal delivery of a punk album along with the abrasiveness of an industrial hip hop album. The standout track for me is [Selfishness of Evil Men]( https://youtu.be/x8hQhatjgjA), a super personal track with some of BLACKIE's most powerful vocal delivery and introspective lyrics. "
YMS,"I'm gonna answer this question assuming that you're genuinely unaware of who Death Grips are. 

Death Grips is an alternative hip-hop act known for their inaccessible music, scummy antics, and general love by a lot of the Internet. This post displays a video of I've Seen Footage, which is one of their (arguably) more popular songs. Definitely check them out if you're open minded. Their sound has really grown as time as progressed. "
YMS,He did a quickie on it. You can watch that to find out yourself. 
streetwear,"OP posted the link above, just in case you didn't see it. "
hiphopheads,"I didn't catch that in my first viewing actually. Wow, you really know how to make a dude want to rewatch a movie. Props. "
hiphopheads,"That's a pretty solid writeup dude. Your interpretation is certainly one that makes sense, and it's close to what I found myself thinking throughout the film and after it ended. "
hiphopheads,"I saw it yesterday too and really liked it. What do you think ""It"" represents? I've heard theories saying that it represents STDs (which the director denied) or pregnancy. I'm still unsure myself what I want to believe. "
Games,"I'm cautiously optimistic about this. On one hand, I really adore the characters and would really enjoy to see them again in a new scenario. On the other hand, I personally felt as if the story didn't really lend itself to a sequel. This may end up being super cash-grabby. I'm afraid they may milk the Steins;Gate license kinda like they did with Persona 4 (I will admit that all those P4 spin-offs and pseudo-sequels were enjoyable though). Hoping for the best here, because the original is probably one of my favorite stories ever, and the anime adaptation was equally enjoyable. "

hiphopheads,"Tetsuo and Youth is hardly what one would call ""funk"". "
hiphopheads,"Then my bad for not catching your intent. And I totally agree with you. Her album was quite enjoyable, but it's certainly nothing that calls for all her talk. I'm interested to see how and if she can follow her album up. If she can improve, then maybe it'll justify some cockiness. Still can't justify being a malicious and hateful individual though. "
hiphopheads,Won't disagree with you there. I'm just saying that suggesting that no one fucks with her music is a bit extreme. 
hiphopheads,"If that's the case, then I don't necessarily disagree. She really does have a problem with keeping herself under wraps and has a super toxic personality. At the same time, it kinda works because it gets people talking about her, which seems is her goal in life most of the time. "
hiphopheads,"Again, I don't disagree entirely with original comment. Never even claimed she was that big. I'm just saying that there's a pretty big difference between how she's doing now and ""no one"" fucking with her music. It's an exaggeration that doesn't really help perpetuate conversation. Or at least any useful kind of conversation. "
hiphopheads,"Theophilus London's album sold three thousand and he had the luxury  of a single with Kanye near release. She sold about the same as Riff Raff, who also had way more promotion for his album than she did. I'm not claiming she did amazing, great, or even good numbers. I'm claiming she's a lot more relevant than you gave her credit for."
hiphopheads,"Listen, I definitely agree with you about her being bitter about everything and that bitterness being undeserved and unearned, but to say that no one fucks with her music is really hyperbolic and ridiculous. 212 was pretty big, her album was reviewed very well (with a 77 on Metacritic), and it didn't sell too pathetically considering how short notice the album was dropped. "
hiphopheads,"My hobby is collecting vinyl. An expensive hobby no doubt. Speaking of vinyl, does anyone here want a download code for Dark Side of the Moon? Got it when I bought it on vinyl, and have no need for it. "

hiphopheads,"I kinda disagree with you about the beat being bad (I think it's average, but not so far as bad), but your other points are valid. You're right though, there are tons of better songs off that very same album that do similar things a lot better. That's the problem with Lupe is that his singles can sometimes be the preachiest shit on the albums (Bitch Bad, etc.). "
hiphopheads,"Care to elaborate some? I don't think it's his best song or anything (all those little interludes can get annoying), but I think it's a bit hyperbolic to call it crappy. The beat isn't terrible and Lupe flows well over it while spitting some cool lines. "
indieheads,"Don't forget the possibility of Death Grips... 

On second thought, you should probably disregard the date Death Grips suggested. "
hiphopheads,"I was kinda disappointed with that EP overall though. A huge step down from So It Goes in my opinion. So It Goes's production was pretty innovative and fresh, and they went and took a few steps back in that regard. "
HotlineMiami,Nice. Thanks for the update! 
HotlineMiami,How do the records sound? Do they have a problem with skipping or something to be concerned about? 
hiphopheads,"Who performed first, and how long was each set? Considering seeing them in Boston, but have zero interest in Trash Talk. "

hiphopheads,"Take a look at Phonte's other work if you're looking for something else to listen to. His work under The Foreign Exchange is solid, with their album Connected being a personal favorite of mine. Their sound is super smooth and colorful. His debut solo album Charity Starts at Home is really good too."

Fun punk rock album. Heard about it in Johnny Marr's AMA. "
hiphopheads,Who played first? How long was Ratking's set? How were they live?
hiphopheads,"I never really got into her music, but it's probably because she has an outstanding voice with excellent producers behind her. She's also arguably one of the bigger voices of female empowerment in the mainstream music industry. You also can't neglect all the big artists she's worked with throughout her career. Basically, she has a lot going for her. "
hiphopheads,"Listened to the track and I have a few criticisms. I won't complain about lyrics, because that's the most subjective thing in the world. The beat wasn't bad, maybe just a bit too simple for my tastes. The biggest things I'd work on are your flow and voice. They're kinda flat and lifeless. If you bring more energy to your music, you'll be bound to captivate more people. But it's a pretty solid start, and deserve props for trying. Just keep on practicing. 

P.S. It'd be best if you got yourself a better mic to record on. "
hiphopheads,"I can't listen now, but will do when I have a chance. Check out /r/makinghiphop too if you haven't already."
PAX,"I honesty don't remember. I'm a Vita gamer, so I don't really notice that sort of specific thing. "
PAX,"From my experience, there are many many more 3DS's than Vitas, so I'd take all the main multi-player games for the 3DS (Pokemon, Monster Hunter, Mario Kart, Animal crossing) and whatever vita games you'd play normally for when you feel like saving the battery for the 3DS. "
indieheads,"Gonna see Mason Jennings in Fort Lauderdale, any word on how his shows are? Also curious about how Tyler, the Creator's shows are.  Finally, I'm wondering if James Blake's music translates well live, and if he's worth seeing. "
hiphopheads,"Yeah, that's a good point. I suppose wording does play a big part in shit like this. And I guess being famous comes with the disadvantage of being critiqued even more so than just you and me. "
hiphopheads,"Do you guys feel artists have an obligation to keep their opinions from the public, specifically if they may be controversial? We hardly hold that against our average joes. Or do artists, considering their position and recognition they receive, have to contain themselves? Does requiring this not further separate the gap between the famous and normal people, putting them on some pedestal not required of others? How do you feel about this issue? Agree or disagree? "

hiphopheads,"Considering what day it is today, let's talk about Nujabes for a bit. Which album do you prefer: Modal Soul or Metaphorical Music? Personally, I prefer Modal Soul. That album has my favorite songs of his (Reflection Eternal and Flowers). "
hiphopheads,"Drake has some great ones. ""The Motto"" was huge, as was ""All Me"". ""Come Thru"" is probably one of my tracks of his too. "
hiphopheads,"You shouldn't really ever have a guilty pleasure. Music is (mostly)  subjective; if you like it, you like it. Don't let someone else's opinion help you determine that the music you like is good or bad. 

But keeping in the spirit of this topic, I'd probably say my ""guilty pleasure"" is Lil B. I understand and agree with a lot of the criticism he gets, but he has some shit that I legitimately enjoy. I'm Gay is a solid album, and 6 Kiss is pretty influential I'd say. "
hiphopheads,Here and KTT definitely have their strengths and weaknesses. So personally it's a tie between those too. 
hiphopheads,"I believe he's referring to quality, not popularity. No one will argue popularity with you.
"
hiphopheads,"Nah, didn't see Boyhood. I'll probably see it at one point in my life, but it doesn't seem like my type of movie. "
hiphopheads,"To those who saw both, which do you prefer: Whiplash or Birdman? I feel like Birdman is the better film, but I enjoyed Whiplash more. "
hiphopheads,"I feel as if general consensus here seems to be ""Good, not great"". People are happy to see Wayne rapping with some fire and intensity again. Personally, I thought it was average. Too much singing, and as others has said, apologizing repeatedly got rather annoying. Still had some solid songs and quotable lines though. "
hiphopheads,"In all seriousness, how do you guys think a gay rapper would be taken amongst mainstream audiences and the rap community? Say they had the talent and sound worth recognizing, would they still be treated seriously? Or do you guys think homophobia is still too heavily prevalent, especially in the rap community, for said person to succeed? If so, could their sexuality positively influence their popularity? Would this be the new ""white rapper"" issue? "
hiphopheads,"Been to a lot of shows, so you'll definitely have a blast. Bring your vice of choice if you're into that, a ton of cash, and a lighter. You can probably just hide your weed in your shoe. It's separate stages in one big warehouse. Buy for pit if you feel it's worth it to you. You don't have to worry about looking ridiculous, since Chicken Man is probably gonna be there. "
hiphopheads,"Thanks for looking out, but I'm already on top of that. Bought my ticket day one. Super hyped to go."
hiphopheads,"Then there are places like The Nest and Churchill's. But either way, we probably either lack the market or are not worth the inconvenience of going so down South. "
hiphopheads,"That's not really true. We have Bardot, LMNT, Grand Central, and some more. Plenty of options really, I think."
hiphopheads,I'd kill for any of these guys to come to Miami. We're seriously neglected when it comes to smaller artists heading down here.

hiphopheads,"The higher the grams, the more sturdy it is. For a lot of record collectors, 180 grams is preferred, because it holds up better over time. Just figured I'd ask for those that would want that kind of information. "
hiphopheads,Do you know how many grams it is? 
hiphopheads,"Yup. It's definitely a return to form for him, for the most part at least. "
leakthreads,What a fucking impressive song. Just the kinda thing he needed to start his album with to pull people in. 
hiphopheads,"Like someone on this subreddit said recently, you may not party to this song, but others may. Depends on the demographic of the party, really. I'm not necessarily saying that I disagree with you at all, but just to keep in mind other people's tastes (as good or bad as they may be). "
TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Guess I was wrong then. They're probably gonna go with the Leave ending, which I personally find the least interesting and suiting for James's character. Leave I feel is way to happy of a end considering how James is portrayed throughout the game. 

At the same time, I recognize the fact that Mary's death may not have impacted him as bad it seems, so Leave may fit fine. It really comes down to interpretation, which makes this game so great. "
TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Seems like they may be aiming for the In Water ending, since he didn't heal himself and look at the letter and photo when talking about it. It's a little early to tell, but I certainly wouldn't mind. That's probably the ending that stuck with me the most. "
hiphopheads,"Flying Lotus by far and away. Flew to Georgia to see him, which was worth every penny. His 3D visuals aren't unparalleled, as is his song selection. "
hiphopheads,Kanye's live show is pretty dope. Flying Lotus live shows are enlightening. The Weeknd gives off some good vibes and sings really well live. 
hiphopheads,He said in an interview that it probably wouldn't be. The article should be on pitchfork.
hiphopheads,"You see, I disagree with you there. I feel like a lot of tracks in the middle of the album get way too poppy and uninteresting when compared to the rest of the album. Not necessarily awful or anything, just not consistent greatness across the whole album."
indieheads,So did you enjoy it then? 
hiphopheads,"I really dig a lot of his stuff, and I'm a huge fan of Clipse. All he needs now is a truly consistent solo album, and he'll probably become a favorite of mine. "
indieheads,"Uncharted games, all the Souls games, Ico/Shadow of the Colossus HD, Heavy Rain if you wanna laugh, Metal Gear Rising:Revengance, and God of War if you want a simple character action game. That should keep you busy. "
hiphopheads,That's true. Gotta love the Isley Brothers. Wouldn't have classic beats like the aforementioned and Big Poppa without them. 
hiphopheads,I think people will still be able to enjoy It Was A Good day in the future. Still holds up today. 
hiphopheads,"I really enjoyed her album actually. It's fun and vibrant, and Banks flows well on the beats. However, sonically the album is closer to a house album than a hip-hop album. So if you don't dig house and electronic music, you may not enjoy it. Definitely give it a spin once to make up your own opinion. 
A few complaints I have are that her lyrics aren't particularly interested or innovative, and the song ""Nude Beach a Go-Go"" is fucking awful. Those things didn't completely hamper the listening experience for me though. "
hiphopheads,"I dig Banks's music, but man does a lot of the shit she says sound like a cry for attention. I understand that Twitter isn't the best place for eloquent responses, but damn, if you've got beef with what some says, commenting like you're on an Internet forum certainly isn't gonna help you cause. She means well, but she seems to lack the capability of expressing her opinion without hyperbole. 

And the sad part is, if this is actually a cry for attention, it's sure working.  Sure, it makes me lose a little respect for her, but she's got reddit and pitchfork talking about her all the time. Hell, I'm waiting time to talk about her right. All I'm saying is that I wish she acted with a resemblance of professionalism and respect for others opinions. "

hiphopheads,"Keep yourself hydrated. Try not to eat too much before you go. Bring a lighter. And most importantly, have fun without annoying everyone else. "
indieheads,I really dig this band. They make some fun music. I remember hearing about them during Johnny Marr's AMA. They were his favorite new band or something to that effect. 
hiphopheads,Zach Hill was making a movie in which Death Grips scored. Seems like this may be the score they recorded. 
hiphopheads,"There's been a few posts about this. Nobody knows. A rumor is that he's in prison, which I believe comes from one of his producers on Twitter. "
indieheads,"The Fillmore in Miami Beach, Florida. Perfectly sized, pretty decor, and around a rather happening area in Miami.  The  sound is almost always excellent there as well. 

I've seen a shitload of shows there, since it brings in quite a few big names. These shows include: Modest Mouse, CHVRCHES, Grizzly Bear, St. Vincent, Queens of the Stone Age, Metric, Atmosphere, Coheed and Cambria, Porter Robinson, and probably some more that I've forgotten. 

Quick shout-out to the Tabernacle in Atlanta , Georgia. The floors bounce when it's crowded and should probably be closed down, but it's a really cool looking place. Been around forever too. "

silenthill,"From the Giant Bomb wiki:

""Character movement in games utilizing tank controls is based on using the up direction on the Analog Stick or D-Pad to move the character forward. Turning is controlled using the left and right directions and the down direction moves the character backwards.

Tank controls are often found alongside fixed CCTV style camera angles in early 3D third-person games on the Playstation, Sega Saturn and PC when developers were still trying to find ways to control 3D games. Newer games rarely utilize tank controls because gamers find them to be unintuitive"".

hiphopheads,"Yeah, I was gonna make a point that they were the least similar. I'd say they are somewhat in the same vein though, with both having a heavy and intense rock sound with a rapper as its lead. Death Grips has the industrial/electronic element to them that separates them from RATM."

Also, he usually performs with a live band, who do an outstanding job as well. If you want to see one of the better live rappers and be at a show with good vibes all around, go see Chance."
hiphopheads,"Clipping, Dalek, Ratking, and Run The Jewels would definitely be up your alley. Also, for future reference, posts like this would definitely be better suited for the Daily Discussion thread. Just trying  to help you out."
hiphopheads,"Mick Jenkins - The Water(s) 
Very similar to the previously mentioned ComfortZone mixtape by Saba, due to it's spacey and jazzy trap sound. Interesting concept too. 

FKA Twigs - LP1
FKA Twigs' debut album. Her sound is very similar to James Blake, which is basically trip-hop sounding R&B. Pretty short album, but spectacular nonetheless."
hiphopheads,"Teebs is definitely the most similar. Shlomo, Four Tet, and Jamie XX are kinda similar. All those artists are generally great, so you should be set for a while."
hiphopheads,"So It Goes is one my favorite projects of the year. The instrumentals are very unique, which I would describe as industrial trap. The flows are diverse, as are the subject matters. However, the rappers' voices are kinda odd, so you may find them annoying. I'd definitely recommend a listen nevertheless."
hiphopheads,"I don't necessarily hate the album, but there's a reason people don't enjoy it. The main complaint was that the production was very samey and not all that great, which is legitimate problem. Also, people felt that his rapping wasn't all that great, and that he did his moaning shit way too much."
hiphopheads,I paid $161 for one of the closer sections. I believe tickets in the back hover around $50. Lawn is about $30.
hiphopheads,Got mine for West Palm Beach as soon as the presale went up. All the shit I saw on KTT about the show made me feel at ease with having spend so much on the ticket.
hiphopheads,Enjoy the show man! Let me know what you though of the show.
hiphopheads,"I went to the one in Ft. Lauderdale on Saturday. It was over-packed as fuck and filled with teenagers looking for drugs and shit. It was also hot as hell and water was six dollars. Overall, it was a decent event. Way too much trap (the electronic kind) music for my taste though. I would maybe go again depending on the lineup next year. "
hiphopheads,"That thread was pretty terrible though. Literally nothing of value was said there. In fact, that post was pretty unnecessary in general. No real discussion can be had over the art for single. There's a reason why the art for singles isn't usually posted here. But ""dat ass"" changes shit I guess."
hiphopheads,"Not me, but I have a friend that legitimately though that Drake said ""And my stomach was soaking wet, she only fired two"", thinking that Drake's mom shot him. "
indieheads,"Have fun with Modest Mouse man. If they are as good as when I saw them, you're in for a treat."
indieheads,"Bought my ticket for Interpol, I'm pretty hyped. Anyone here seen them before? If so, how were they?"
hiphopheads,Madlib by far. I'd say my favorites are Auditorium by Mos Def and Absolutely by DOOM.
nin,"How was the light show? If you saw them during the Tension Tour, how would you compare?"
hiphopheads,Just remember this: you're definitely gonna wanna remember that show if it's as good as it seems it will be. Up to you though.
hiphopheads,"Saba's new mixtape #ComfortZone came out today, y'all should definitely check it out. I have very high first impressions on the thing. For those of you who don't know who Saba is, he does the guest verse on Everybody's Something off of Acid Rap."
YMS,You didn't post a video though...
hiphopheads,"Yeah man. Got the email about it the other day. I'm down here in Miami, so if anything I'll be going to the show over here."
hiphopheads,"I recently found out that Yung Lean was coming to my town. Has anyone here seen him live? If so, how was he? "
hiphopheads,[Wamp Wamp] ( http://youtu.be/mZ0iUNI0ncc)
bassnectar,Hopefully another Miami show (BassLights again?) . Still having withdrawal after BassLights last year. 
indieheads,"I'm a mild fan of Jack White (never listened to his solo stuff, liked the White Stripes and Raconteurs), and he's coming to somewhere I'd be able to make it to. Do you think it's worth the price of the ticket for someone like me? Also, is he any good live? "
hiphopheads,"Bought tickets for Drake vs. Lil Wayne. Anyone see either of them live before? If so, how were they? "
indieheads,"Panic! At The Disco is a lot better then people give them credit I feel. Sure, their debut is kinda mediocre, but I find most of their music pretty enjoyable, especially Pretty Odd, their second album. "
hiphopheads,"Definitely B L A C K I E. All of his music is available for free on his website, so that's a plus. If you wanna start with album of his, probably start with Gen."
hiphopheads,"I've really enjoyed the songs he's released so far, with this song continuing that trend. ComfortZone looks like it's gonna turn out great. Hope Saba blows up soon."

ModestMouse,"I thought it was spectacular. One of the best shows I've been to in fact. Isaac had a lot of energy throughout the whole show, and the rest of the band was on point as well. I found the setlist pretty amazing as well, with nearly no one album being focused the whole time. Overall, if you love their music, you're gonna have a blast.
"
hiphopheads,You might enjoy parts of So Far Gone and Thank Me Later by Drake. You may also enjoy the Man on the Moon albums by Kid Cudi.
hiphopheads,"I love me some Little Brother. They had a great, mostly consistent discography. Don't get enough love in my opinion. "
hiphopheads,"I feel like there's a lot of heads here that don't really appreciate The Minstrel Show by Little Brother. This album has been a personal favorite of mine for a while now. I really love the soulful production on this tape and the broad range of topics covered. The album plays as a parody of black pop-culture, which was done so well that apparently it was deemed as ""too intelligent"" by BET, who refused to play the single off the album ""Lovin' It"". To me, it seems like a lot of people don't recognize how much people owe Little Brother for Drake, who was a big influence on him when it comes to sound and flow. I'd highly suggest giving the album a listen if you have a chance!"
hiphopheads,"Dilla's sample of ""Theme From Midnight Express"" by Giorgio Moroder for ""Phantom of the Synths"" is pretty great, especially since it's been used by DOOM and Jay Electronica. I love what 9th Wonder did with Michael Franks song ""I Really Hope It's You"" for the Little Brother song ""All for You"" (a favorite of mine). Another favorite is ""Movie Finale"" by Madlib, which is used in the Mos Def song ""Auditorium"". When it comes to Madlib though, there's so many options to pick from. "
hiphopheads,"If you're near or in Florida, a Friday ticket for Big Guava Fest this weekend is $90. "
hiphopheads,"The Knight's Gambit by Ka is pretty dark. There are some pretty eerie beats on Vaudeville Villain by Viktor Vaughn. One may describe Liquid Swords by GZA as dark. The Weeknd can get dark sometimes as well, but he's more of the R&B side of hip-hop. Those are just a few things that came to the top of my head. If you're feeling experimental, midcity by clipping may satisfy you as well."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,They were THAT negative about the game? Or was Konami acting sensitive? 
TwoBestFriendsPlay,"Thanks for the link, I'll definitely watch that eventually. I just came off beating that game though, so I definitely don't wanna sit through those cut scenes again so soon."
hiphopheads,"Yeah, Big Guava's lineup is pretty tight. Chance, Vic Mensa, Earl, and Outkast all at the same place. Its non-hip-hop lineup is great as well."
PAX,"Does that work for all Riot employees, or just specific ones?"
PAX,"You'll be fine just showing up with the badges; that's all you need. And trust me, it'll be easy to find the entrance. Just look for and follow the big line of people."
PAX,Great. Thanks for letting me know! I hope you enjoyed your time at Pax!
PAX,"Hey man, I was at Pax today too, and I was wondering how and where you got the Varus skin? Also, is it true that they're giving out a ward skin too?"
hiphopheads,"Any album by DJ Krush. He's rather similar to Nujabes, so you would probably really like him. Check out his album Ki-Oku, it's great and jazzy."
PAX,No problem sir. I believe the subreddit you are looking for is /r/ploompax.
PAX,"This is a subreddit about Penny Arcade Expo, not a vaporizer. Sorry dude."
hiphopheads,Care to elaborate? What about him and/or his music put the nail in the coffin for you?
PAX,"Wrong subreddit dude. This about Penny Arcade Expo, not e-cigs."
bassnectar,"437.
And thanks for the chance dude!"
hiphopheads,I think one of the most iconic stories in rap would be Children's Story by Slick Rick. My personal favorite would probably be All for You by Little Brother. Such a great song off a mostly unappreciated album 
hiphopheads,"From the rappers I've seen live, Atmosphere, Vic Mensa, Chance, Kanye, Evidence, Run the Jewels, Blueprint, and Kendrick don't use backing tracks. That's really most, if not all of the rappers I've seen live. The only rappers I've seen with the backing tracks are Travis Scott and Robb Banks. Is it fair to assume that only relatively unpopular rappers use it? I'm genuinely curious to hear what big named rappers use it."
Games,"I never incountered any, but then again I did have the DSFIX, so that might be the reason why I didn't have any problems. "
Games,"Personally, I would suggest the PC the version; this is because of the mods available for it that allow you to make the game prettier, run at 60 FPS, and even invite your friends directly if they have the game on PC. However, if none of those things interest you, the console version is more than suitable. "
nin,Yup. It's exclusive to Beats Music though. I'm pretty sure you can find a copy of it somewhere on the internet though *winks*. 
hiphopheads,"Hey man, I listened to the song you linked and thought it showed some promise. The beat you were riding was damn good, and you didn't have any lyrics that I found cringingly bad on first listen. I did have two problems though. The first is that I thought the hook went on a bit too long considering how simple it was. The second thing is that I thought you didn't do enough to differentiate yourself from other rappers. I'm not sure if they influenced you at all, but you sounded a bit too similar to Aesop Rock and Eminem throughout the song. Work on those two things, and I'm sure you'll end up being great."
hiphopheads,"[My Adidas by Run DMC] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA8DsUN6g_k&feature=youtube_gdata_player) is probably one of the most iconic songs about shoes of all time. 

"
hiphopheads,"While Kendrick is great, I'm not sure if we can jump to this conclusion yet. He's technically only released two studio albums, and it seems like people here are split between which they find better. If mixtapes count, then I guess you could say this is true though."
truegaming,"I feel Silent Hill 2's soundtrack is one of the most important reasons why the game is so memorable. The soundtrack plays a huge part of setting the unsettling atmosphere throughout the game. It's a rollercoaster of sounds, ranging from subdued and ambient to loud and prominent. Here's a track from the opening moments of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS6HX2m-HNY&feature=youtube_gdata_player."
Games,"I found the game incredibly enjoyable (in fact, it was my GOTY). I really enjoyed how fleshed out all of the characters were, each getting their own equal time to shine. I also found it clever how they handled the system for replaying events by tying it in with the narrative. The music in that game is really great too, which is something people usually forget to mention. 

By the way, I'd strongly recommend you playing through 999 whenever you get the chance. That game was really well done (again, another killer soundtrack), and I think you'll enjoy it considering how much you liked VLR. From there, if you enjoy games with storytelling similar to those, I'd recommend you getting into visual novels. /r/visualnovels would be a great place to get you started."
hiphopheads,"If you ever have the chance, definitely see him live. He goes fucking nuts. Granted, he didn't do much rapping when I saw him, but his energy was incredible and he got everyone going nuts."
hiphopheads,"Oh, okay, my bad. Didn't think he had actually played that song before live. Thanks for the link though! "
hiphopheads,Chance played a new song at a concert last night and it was great! Anyone here have video of it? 
hiphopheads,"Well, best of luck to you sir or mam!"
hiphopheads,Maybe you need to lower the ticket prices? It's better to sell at a loss then to lose all your money. 
hiphopheads,Put the tickets on StubHub then. They'll probably sell there. 
hiphopheads,"Who here has bought tickets for the Yeezus Tour? What city are you seeing him and where are you sitting? To start, I bought GA for the Miami show."
hiphopheads,No problem!
hiphopheads,You might enjoy Midcity by Clipping. He's raps over industrial beats and it's pretty good. You can get it for free off of Bandcamp.
hiphopheads,"Anyone here into Pretty Lights and/or Bassnectar and been to one of their concerts? I'm a big fan and bought tickets for BassLights, and I'm just wondering what I should expect."
