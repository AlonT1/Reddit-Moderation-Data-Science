Games,"They didn't send out any review copies, and most sites don't operate on the weekend. The only people who played it is people who bought it for themselves."
Games,"So I'm currently playing this game for review reasons and... yeah it's bad. It's basically mediocre burnout only the cars slip a lot and sometimes there's QTE.

But also I can't tear my eyes away from it. It's one of the most genuinely entertaining games I've played just for its ""so bad its good"" factor. It's so wild I can't get over it.

Also I'm still kind of upset that one of the most genuinely positive and well done deceptions of a non-binary character in gaming is trapped in Fast and Furious: Crossroads. If only it was a good game."

The book says that no one knows what really happens. It does note IGN's article says she was pushed out, but it also notes Sony's response and does talk to Wells, who says the rumors were untrue. Hennig declined to be interviewed for the book, so we'll probably never know."
Games,All good now.
Games,On my end the post hasn't been edited at all and the spoilers are all open and unmarked. You gotta get rid of the spaces between the tags and the writing.
Games,Hey I removed this post. You gotta fix the spoiler tags. Once you do give me a heads up and I'll reapprove it.
Games,"We did this when Fallout 76 was released exactly because of that. Fallout 76 is the reason we have ""a second review thread is okay if..."" in the rules.

Edit to clarify: We personally didn't do it, but we allowed another user to post a second review thread and decided that should be in the rules."
Games,"Hey there!

Due to an excess of individual reviews from Youtube and other sites, we have decided to host a second Review/Megathread as a place for any reviews which may have fallen outside of the Review Thread window.

We are doing this to avoid our front page from being flooded with nothing but reviews for an individual game, which is what Review Threads are meant to help mitigate in the first place.

Thanks."

Games,"I made this post in another thread, but here's four games I really enjoyed and never see anyone talk about:

**2000:1: A Space Felony** is a super weird murder mystery in a space station. It has a great premise, is pretty hilarious, and I think the ending sequence was one of my favorite things that I played through last year.

**Extreme Meatpunks Forever** is a visual novel/brawler where you pilot mechs made of meat to punch nazis in their stupid face. Great cast, fun art style, awesome soundtrack.

**Yi and the Thousand Moons** is a video game opera about a woman who shoots the moon out of the sky. Quite short, but I loved the visuals/soundtrack and it felt super unique.

Finally, **Pendula Swing** is kind of like ""what if Shadowrun was set in the roaring 20's?"" It's a bit iffy gameplay-wise, but the world and writing are both absolutely fantastic and it's super wroth playing."
Games,"A Short Hike is great, though I decided to just go with games I've straight up never seen anyone talk about, and A Short Hike is one I see a lot of people talk about"
Games,Mine goes to forced stealth in a game with no stealth mechanics
Games,"So there's a lot of games in this bundle, but here's four I played that I never see anyone talk about and alone are worth $5:

**2000 : 1: A Space Felony** is a super weird murder mystery in a space station. It has a great premise, is pretty hilarious, and I think the ending sequence was one of my favorite things that I played through last year.

Games,"The super strange PSP version of the game included this totally random ""Historical mission"" mode where you just played cool boss fights from the six movies."
Games,I remember one game (I want to say Age of Empires 2 HD) had a Steam achievement for pre-odering the game and I genuinely couldn't think of one that bothered me more.

Games,"Amanda Young from 2 and 3, which makes sense as her whole thing was that she didn't quite believe in Jigsaw's ""everyone deserves a chance"" thing and thought people should just die.

Also that trap is in the game. Amanda's gimmick is that she can put reverse bear traps on the people she catch and they have to find those traps scattered around the map to try and find the key before it engages and kills them."
Games,"The thing that always gets me about face campers is that it's such a shitty way to play the game, because you literally get less points from it. You'd get more points if you down and hook survivors several times. The only time it's really useful is in the very very end game when you're clearly not getting any other survivors."
Games,Ok but only if Samuel L Jackson actually shows up to Samuel L Jackson at the monsters.

Games,"I'm like 80% positive if it got to the point where it's sending you a notification, its been manually removed rather than automodded. If someone's post is a few sentences long, it shouldn't be getting hit by low effort."
Games,"For the misleading stuff, we'd rather err on the side of caution. How it's worded, especially in a title, is a major part in how people will read and react to something."
Games,"According to the FAQ it's based on a few things:

If the review has a score then publication can set what score a game needs to be achieved to count as recommended, but if they don't then it has to score higher than the publications' average score. If the review doesn't have a score, then they go with verbiage that would mean the same (the examples they give being Eurogamer's ""recommended"" or Angry Centaur Gaming's ""Buy""). If the review is manually added to the site, then the author can selected if they're recommended or not."
Games,"uh... you may be looking for a different thread?

I guess [Distrust: Polar Survival](https://store.steampowered.com/app/635200/Distrust_Polar_Survival/) though?"
Games,"If the hammer drops, it drops. Until then we aren’t going to be banning entire games. I agree that they’re gross, but that’s about it."
Games,"Honestly, unless Reddit Admins step in and tell us to change something, I can’t really see us changing how we do this.

From a pure practicability standpoint, we’d have to ban all discussion of Dragon Ball Fighterz, and those other games that I’ve already forgotten the names of. Simply, that won’t fly with most of the mod team, nor most the people here. 

If the post serves no purpose other than to show off underaged characters sexually then it probably doesn’t fit here anyway. If it’s a game, we’d mark it NSFW and talk internally, but it seems doubtful we’d remove it."
Games,"Sure, I’m game, give me weird LOTR."
Games,"I mean, I want to have my expectations subverted and I think if the best you can do is the same thing but more pretty then you should step aside for someone with more ambition. I love the direction FF7R went in and am so excited for what’s next."
Games,"> As far as I'm aware neither the product packaging or the store listing informs the customer that this is a remake of only the Midgar section, not the entirety of FF7's story.

The back of the box says ""The story of this first, standalone game in the FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE project covers up to the party's escape from Midgar and goes deeper into the events occurring in the city than the original FINAL FANTASY VII"" So yes, it's literally on the packaging."
movies,"ok, but like...

we can also just keep calling it COVID-19"
movies,"I mean, we could also just keep calling it COVID-19 and not risk being racism too"

Also can u get a hyena on the TV?"
Games,Too much work for something that doesn't drive sales
Games,Sounds like it’s Epic.
Games,"Sorta kinda. It certainly talked about quite a bit of issues. For example, Lucas himself. They mention that he had a really bad habit of popping in and demanding changes, the most infamous of which being that he suddenly decided the main character needed to be Boba Fett two months before they announced the game. This had both major story/writing issues (they already recorded lines and animations with actor Wilson Bethel, and that all needed to be scrapped) and gameplay issues (they were told they had to have Boba Fett's jetpack, which means having to redesign everything from environments to make use of it, to AI to react to it.)

The game could probably still have been salvaged, but the book straight up quotes developers talking about how difficult working with Lucas was, and how he just didn't seem to know how to work with game studios."

Games,"I feel like if you have to use ctrl+f to find the free game, they fucked up."
Games,"I must have missed it TBH. I only ever saw the game on some Steam discovery list, and I've never seen it talked about."
Games,"Here's some random one I've really come to enjoy and have found through various methods.

[**Code 7**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/650570/Code_7_A_StoryDriven_Hacking_Adventure/) - It's an episodic text-based hacking adventure game. Three of the four planned episodes (plus a prologue) are out right now, and it def seems like episode 4 will happen. I absolutely love this one, was totally shocked by just how fantastic the combination works out. There's a free prologue episode I super suggest playing.

[**stikir**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/952200/stikir/) - Short little weird meta game about making the game you're playing. Constantly changes gameplay styles and has a ton of really fun boss fights and weird ideas.

[**Cradle**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/361550/Cradle/) - I know this game has like 1,000 reviews, but I've honestly never seen anyone talk about it. Sci-fi first person adventure game set in Mongolia. Weird plot, pretty fun game. Love the art.

[**Heaven's Vault**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774201/Heavens_Vault/) - An adventure game about translating a dead language and trying to find a mysterious hidden site to maybe save the world. Awesome characters, fantastic setting, tons of choices that play out in big and small ways.

[**Lightstep Chronicles**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/983290/Lightstep_Chronicles/) - Sci-fi visual novel about a dude who gets trapped on a spaceship with a bunch of crazy AI. Apparently based on a book/comic series. If you beat the game you get the book for free, which is real neat. Lots of awesome world building.

[**Re-Legion**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/782140/ReLegion/) - It's an experimental cyberpunk RTS where you need to convert random people to your religious cult. I don't think it's great, but I do think it tries enough ideas to be worth giving a shot for fans of the genre. Just got a big update recently, that may help a lot.

[**This Strange Realm of Mine**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/655730/This_Strange_Realm_Of_Mine/) - Pixeley Doom-esque FPS that also delves into philosophy and poetry. It's a weird mix, but it comes out with a game that's super unique and a lot of fun.

[**The World Next Door**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755470/The_World_Next_Door/) - A match-3/RPG combination game. Once again, I don't think it's fantastic, but it's a fun little game and I love the art and world quite a bit. Worth playing for that alone.

**[10,000,000](https://store.steampowered.com/app/227580/10000000/) / [You Must Build a Boat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/290890/You_Must_Build_A_Boat)** - This one may also be a little more ""mainstream indie"", but this is a pair of super awesome match-3/dungeon crawling hybrid games. It's a genre I love and wish more people tried TBH.

[**Adam Wolfe**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/483420/Adam_Wolfe/) - I know it's a casual adventure game/hidden object game, but this one is actually really cool. A neat little change on the genre that includes a lot of weird puzzles and even FPS segments.

[**Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action!**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/269230/Aces_Wild_Manic_Brawling_Action/) - A neat little arcade-styled beat 'em up game. If you like that or character action games, this is totally worth it.

[**Anarcute**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/390720/Anarcute/) - A riot simulator with cute animals that riot. You collect big parties that riot, and you march them around and punch both fascist and capitalists. Basically perfect.

[**Stone**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/907770/STONE/) - A game where you play as an Australian Koala that gets blackmailed and is looking for his missing boyfriend. Very much a ""stoner noir"" game, as described to me. Once again, I don't think it's great, but I do think it's unique.

[**Loud on Planet X**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365200/LOUD_on_Planet_X/) - A tower defense/rhythm game hybrid that somehow has a soundtrack by bands like CHVRCHES, Metric, Lights, HEALTH, and more. I have no clue how they managed that.

[**The Uncertain: The Last Quiet Day**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/406970/The_Uncertain_Last_Quiet_Day/) - Technically the first episode in what was supposed to be an episodic series (episode 2 is set for 2020, maybe?), it's an adventure game where you play as a curious robot that accidentally stumbles upon the first humans seen in a long while. It's pretty neat.

[**Shu**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/528720/Shu/) - Super awesome and fluid 2d platformer. Seemed to go really under the radar, which is a shame because it's great.

[**Darknet**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/401910/Darknet/) - A really awesome VR-supporting puzzle game/RTS hybrid. You command little virus armies to move around and try to hack the internet. I really enjoyed it.

[**Aaero**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/499890/Aaero/) - Rhythm game/SHMUP mash-up that has some really neat ideas and cool boss fights. Great soundtrack too."

Games,"I mean that’s already fantastic value. 

You can go through older levels with puzzle solving shit you get from later levels to find collectibles, and there’s a combat arena you can go through. I’d say 30ish hours to 100%."
Games,I haven't played 3 so I can't answer this.
Games,"I think I only died to one of the early bosses. I was playing on normal difficulty and managed to beat every boss, albeit a few were pretty close. The game has a rather generous death system (if War/Strife dies you'll switch characters and the other gets revived at half health in 20 seconds) so it's pretty tough to die as a whole."
Games,"In my time, Strife played as a pretty typical twin-stick shooter while War played more like a character action game. Combine this with the length of the game (It's like 20 hours) and the strong enemies and it made me feel like Strife was just up against bullet sponges. It's never so bad that I was completely bored, but War was def more fun to play."
Games,"The TechRaptor review is mine if anyone has any questions about the game. Was fun shit, I was pretty surprised by it."

SubredditDrama,"I heard this story, but it's kinda off. They wanted Starkiller to be ""Darth Somebody"" in the original Force Unleashed, because they felt that would have made the game more legit. When they asked Lucas he said yes, but they had to go with either ""Darth Insanius"" or ""Darth Icky."" They chose to not use the Darth name.

(apparently showing up and demanding weird changes was normal for Lucas. In Lucas Art's oft forgotten (for good reason) 2008 third person shooter Fracture the main character ended up with the name ""Jet"" because Lucas felt he was always ""jetting around."" Likewise, in an ultimately canceled Darth Maul prequel game, Lucas saw an action figure of Darth Maul next to another red-skinned Star Wars character and decided they had to be friends/lovers, and the team had to explain that the characters existed in two totally different time periods.)"

Games,I'm gunna go ahead and say that shutting down the subreddit was no big deal and users have indeed shrug and come back the next day. I am hopeful at least a few reflected on their behavior.

The aesthetics are great and there's something hilariously awesome about the way you can grab and slam/eat people, but the game desperately needed a lock-on system or snap-to when it came to grabbing objects or switches.

Still, it was one of those games that had all the potential and just needed a bit of work. Hoping to play this demo later and see how its grown."

Games,"Yeah I saw Werewolf at E3 too and really thought it was neat. As far as I can tell though, they released absolutely nothing to the public outside of some concept art, and everything out right now is just the press talking about what they saw.

Mosaic was super neat. I'm hyped as all hell for that one."
Games,"Quite a few of them didn't have much, if any, of a public showing (Werewolf wasn't show to the public at all, Stronghold only had a minute long trailer during the Kinda Funny show, etc.)"
Games,"Honestly a lot of the games I saw had passion behind them. From AAA games like Man of Medan and Psychonauts 2, to the AA stuff like Werewolf and Stronghold: Legends, to even weird indie projects such as Project Witchstone and Mosaic. The only game I felt actually lacked passion that I saw/played was Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot."
Games,"I played it at E3, and honestly? It was so absolutely, amazingly, insanely good that I would agree with it winning here. Perhaps the only other game that I'd consider (that I played) was Control."
Games,"Yes, you can at any point in the menus."
Games,"There are underwater gameplay sequences. I'm going to go full lazy and just copy/paste what I wrote

> Reed occasionally needs to don a diving suit and take a trip into the flooded waters, which can be pretty hit and miss. On one hand, these are probably some of the creepiest segments of The Sinking City. There’s something outright horrifying about seeing a giant tentacled monster swimming just off in the distance. On the other hand, these segments are often pretty slow. They usually require little other than walking from A to B while sometimes shooting a fish with a spear gun. At least they’re all pretty short and don’t manage to outstay their welcome."
Games,I mean I guess
Games,"Too much, which is part of the problem. They’re basically going to happen every time you enter a house, and each of the main quests has like 3-5 fights. I sent the combat difficulty (you can adjust combat and investigation difficulty separate) to easy pretty early in, made the experience a lot better."
Games,"That's a tricky question. If it was $40 I'd say yes, absolutely.

At $60... It mostly depends what you're looking for. I suggest setting the combat difficulty to easy because that makes the game flow a lot better. If you can deal with the combat being bad, I think the atmosphere really does nail it."
Games,"Stuff you can get through. Most often it was visual stuff, like things falling through the ground, or AI problems, like cops turning hostile towards me when they see monsters, or enemies getting stuck on walls."
Games,I wrote the review for TechRaptor if anyone has any questions. Bit of a shame about the combat but I still like the game quite a bit.
Games,"Are there hyenas in the game and, if not, when will there be? Is important."
Games,"I played the original version of the game and [wrote a review for it](https://techraptor.net/content/re-legion-review-revision) and thought it was a mess.

For starters the only content in the original game was the campaign, which took me about 7 or so hours to finish. The writing isn't great either. The cult leader has the exact wrong personality to lead a cult: he has the willpower of a tree frog. If anyone asks him anything he'll take a ""hard stance"" against it, then seconds later they'll ask a second time and he'll yield and allow it. It doesn't help that every character is a blithering idiot. When the prophet first shows up his super awesome grand idea no one had ever considered before is to destroy the evil CEO's company. He's instantly promoted to the leader of a cult.

When it came to gameplay, the ideas were good but executed poorly. For example, to create units you have to actually evangelize citizens and then train them into what you want. The idea is that you actually wander around and find people to evangelize. However, random citizens spawn in specific areas at specific intervals, so it's really easy to just find an unlimited source of people.

The enemy AI was also dumb as bricks. They basically followed one path from point A to your base, and never broke from this path for any reason. You can right away figure out if buildings you capture are in any danger or can be left totally unguarded because enemies will never go out of their way for something in a corner. Likewise, the pathfinding is really bad. People got stuck all the time, and I had a lot of issues getting groups where I wanted. Neutral citizens had a problem with getting stuck in large clumps that are impossible to untangle no matter what you do.

Maybe this version will give the content that's needed. The skirmishes are def a step in the right direction. But at release, eh."
Games,This was literally an advertised feature of the game though.

Games,When I played through it I would have put it at the 8-10 range. It probably matters how much time you spend taking in the atmosphere and looking for hidden things though.
Games,"I've played a lot of games with this style of stuff.

To give an example: at one point in the game you're given the choice to save one of two characters. This sounds like a major decision. However, it's not, as the character you choose to save promptly drops out of the game and never shows up again."
Games,"Yes. There's some really bad puzzles, a hilariously terrible mood killing shooting segment, bad stealth, and crummy graphics. The story and setting (and, IMO, soundtrack) carries the game really hard, as does the fact that at least it feels like Call of Cthulhu is trying something new rather than just reusing other game's ideas."
Games,"Honestly I thought it was launching at $60 and my general view was ""It's not worth $60 but is worth $40"".

So... I mean if you're a Lovecraft fan, yes."
Games,Sleeping until 2pm
Games,"I don’t have time to play a second time. If I did, I’m not sure I would. Admittedly this is part because I am very much a “one and done” type of gamer. 

Honestly I saw some choices that /felt/ major but didn’t seem to affect the game much. Outside of the final choice, I didn’t see anything that really changed the story massively one way or another. "
Games,No. It’s very consistently been on my “I want to play this so bad” list but I never find time. One day. 
Games,Nasty. I’d take sun dried peppers any day of the week.

Games,"Like I think they're worth doing because they're fun. Usually they have the most interesting puzzles in them, and I really wanted hit up every tomb/crypt that I could just to see how it changed the game. One had a puzzle that required me to kick rafts around so I could avoid piranhas, another had the classic light beam puzzle only instead the goal was to get light to /not/ shine on things. It's cool stuff.

That said, the rewards are pretty meh. For the most part it's just passive buffs (hold breath longer underwater, use skill you already had but twice in a row now), or costumes that give passive buffs."
Games,Honestly they felt pretty similar. 
Games,Yeah I think so. It at least bascially wraps everything up.
Games,"Uh... I don't remember how many exact. Most are based on ancient Mayan/Incan culture.

Neat thing: you can also get Lara's TR2013, Rise, TR2, and Angel of Darkness character models. They use the actual lower poly models for each one."
Games,Yes. Shit wasn't any good. Alternative music for life.
Games,Barely any.
Games,"Go sit down and Google ""Maned Wolf"". Look how weird those shits are. Now imagine a few of them tearing apart Lara, who can't get away because she broke her ankle falling into the wolf pit.

Most the deaths are toned down from TR2013. I would argue that's the most gruesome in the series."
Games,"While you're right that it's not very different from Rise, in fact that's easily my biggest issue with the game, Rise was bascially an excellent game. ""It's a lot like an excellent game"" is still pretty high praise."
Games,"It's bigger than Rise, but works the same. Generally openish world and you slowly gain abilities to hit new areas. I don't think it's any more focused on exploration than the other two, but the series has always been pretty exploration focused."
Games,"I'd saaaay... 10 hours for main story, 25 to 100%"
Games,"Less gruesome than the last two actually. Don't fall into the wolf pit tho, that wolf pit is Hella gruesome. "
Games,"I played on base Ps4. Considering how lovely the game is, and how it's one of its biggest strengths, you should hit up that 4k."
Games,"I have the same issues with this one that I did the last two. The characters that aren't Lara are about as interesting as wet tissue, and the overall plot feels like a character drama with no character. Lara herself is still great though."
Games,"I wrote the review for TechRaptor so if you guys got any questions feel free to ask.

I have to say I thought I'd be one of the higher reviews because I'm a big ol' softy and something struck me as off about the game. Generally happy to see lots of people liked it more though."

> Both China and India had most levels set up so you could get through with very little to no killing. In fact, they even rewarded you for getting through levels with as few deaths as possible. On the other hand, Russia had a lot of levels where you could only advance by killing all enemies. The enemies were always in really tight quarters, and killing all of them without alerting others felt nearly impossible at times.
> 
> China and India both had chase sequences where they would play more like speedy platformers, but they were more of a ""once every few levels"" thing and often weren't overly complicated. Russia had one every level, and they seemed to require a series of pixel perfect jumps and slides. Often the game would have trouble getting down ladders, and I remember one sequence where I must have gotten hit by a train several times because I wasn't in exactly the correct spot, even if I was over the ladder still.
> 
> China and India you earned points for your actions, and if you got enough points in a level you got a stat boost or an active bonus. Russia was the same, but the point requirements were much higher (and, again, didn't seem to work with the much more kill-heavy objectives) and getting those stat boosts was much more difficult.

52book,"Having another great week.

So I finished both of the shorter books I was reading. The first was **Stairway to Badass: The Making and Remaking of Doom 2016, by David L. Craddock**. It was a pretty informative and interesting to read.

I also got through **Can & Can'tankerous, by Harlan Ellison**. It was a short story collection. I enjoyed most of them, though there were a few that just totally flew over my head and I didn't care for.

I'm still going at **Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett**. I'm about 30% of the way through it and am enjoying it quite a bit.

I picked up **The League of Regrettable Superheroes: Half-Baked Heroes from Comic Book History, by Jon Morris**. Fun little biographies of bad super hero ideas. More of a side thing, but I kinda love it.

I also started reading **The Shadow Out of Time, by H.P. Lovecraft** last night. It's only 75 pages so I was going to plow through it in one night, but I wasn't feeling great so I stopped at chapter 3. May do that tonight.

Finally still listening to **Life, The Universe and Everything, by Douglas Adams** on Audiobook. Not enjoying it quite as much as the first two books, but still entertaining. Half way through that."
Games,"Considering the title of the video is ""Halo: Fireteam Raven Arcade Experience Reveal Trailer"", that would have been a totally okay title for the OP to use."

oh, uh... which games?"
Games,"> The only other possibilities are someone from IX (Garnet or Beatrix), from X (although DLC #5 is likely Yuna, so having two FFX characters in a single season is unlikely), FFXIII (Serah, Vanille, Fang), or FFXIV (Lyse). And considering all of those are underwhelming/unlikely, it's gotta be Rinoa.

While every part of me wants Beatrix, there's also FFXV. I actually think Aranea Highwind from XV would be likely. "
Games,"> Freya is barely a character.

52book,"""Now consider the tortoise and the eagle"" - Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett

""Marty Stratton knew a good sound when he heard it."" - Stairway to Badass, by David L. Craddock

""I'm drifting. That's one of the symptoms of the stroke- I drift a lot; all the tales seem interlocking now."" - Can and Can'tankerous, by Harlan Ellison"
Games,"Sounds like there was a meeting between the ""working on it"" and ""nevermind"""
Games,I feel like linking to a tweet where Ron says he found out from a company meeting isn't a good way to prove that a twitter post is how the employees found out?
52book,"I'm really plowing through this challenge this year...

So the other night I finished **The Lies of Locke Lamore, by Scott Lynch**. I loved it, though I'm wary to start the sequel because of how long it seems to be between books. Still, I'll keep an eye on it.

I decided it was finally time to kick my ass back onto my list. So my next book is **Small Gods, by Terry Pratchett**. I read the first 70ish pages and am enjoying it so far.

I'm still reading **Stairway to Badass: The Making and Remaking of Doom 2016, by David L. Craddock** as well, though for the most part I put it aside last week to finish Locke Lamore. I'll probably get it done this week.

I also randomly picked up **Can & Can'tankerous, by Harlan Ellison**. It's a short story collection. I only read the first story in it so far, so we'll see where it goes.

On the audiobook front I happened to finish **The Secret History of Wonder Woman, by Jill Lepore** on the way home from work today. It was rather interesting, even if I got lost a few times.

My next audiobook will be **Life, the Universe and Everything, by Douglas Adams**. I'll prolly get that started tomorrow."
52book,"Last week I took an overnight shift at work, and we basically did nothing. So I used it to basically read through the entirety of **Mongrels, by Stephen Graham Jones**. My impression upon finishing it hasn't changed much from what I said last week: it was okay, but felt like it was trying way too hard to be shocking and disgusting at times.

Anyway, I'm now back to **The Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch**, which I'm 50% of the way through. Enjoying it greatly.

Picked up **Stairway to Badass: The Making and Remaking of Doom 2016, by David L. Craddock** on the side. It's a shorter book about the creation of, well... the 2016 Doom reboot. Also has stuff about the original Doom too. Interesting so far, but only read the first chapter.

On the audiobook side, I'm a little over 50% of the way through **The Secret History of Wonder Woman, by Jill Lepore**. I have to say, there is one insane cast of people involved in her creation."
Games,"As someone who's second favorite is 13, I'll fight you!

For reals, this seems weird. 15 is a pretty fun game. Sure it has issues, but I had a better time with it than the majority of the series (albeit, a good chance is probably because I've kind of grown out of turn based combat)"
Games,"I'm actually going to E3 this year and I'm fukkin' pumped.

Also my favorite E3 moments will basically always be Aisha Tyler, who I can't get enough of. "
52book,"I'm still reading **The Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch** but I ended up putting it aside this week because I got a weird itch to start some new books.

The first was **A River in Darkness: One Man's Escape from North Korea, by Masaji Ishikawa**. I got it free from Amazon for that World Book day thing they did. Plowed through it in a week. It was really interesting, and a shocking look into North Korea. I also feel really bad for Masaji, since it never really feels he got anything close to a happy ending.

I also grabbed **Mongrels, by Stephen Graham Jones**. It's ok, but I feel like it's trying a little too hard to be shocking/disgusting at times. 

On the audiobook front I finished **The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, by Douglas Adams**. Just as enjoyable as the first book.

My next audiobook is **The Secret History of Wonder Woman, by Jill Lepore**. I'm enjoying it, but I'm having the same problem that I did with Hidden Figures last year. There's too many names for me to easily keep track of in an audiobook, so I'm wishing I just read it."
52book,"This week I got distracted by tiny books. So I read a pair of tiny books written by Jon Ronson.

The first was **Frank: The True Story That Inspired the Movie, by Jon Ronson**. It's my new shortest book at 37 pages. Just gave a quick history of Frank Sidebottom, a super weird and super great musical act. The movie is great by the way, I suggest seeing it.

The second was **The Amazing Adventures of Phoenix Jones (and the Less Amazing Adventures of Some Other Real-Life Superheroes), by Jon Ronson**. Only a little longer at 46 pages. Offered a really neat insight into a world I don't think about at all, but actually fascinates me.

Besides that I'm still reading **The Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch**. About 30% of the way through it, and am enjoying it a lot.

Also still got my audiobook going, which is **The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, by Douglas Adams**. I'm 70% of the way through, so almost done. Will easily have that finished this week. I'm loving it, and honestly I think I enjoy Martin Freeman more than Stephen Fry."
Games,"> What I really miss are new FPS PvE IPs. What's the last non-indy campaign focused shooter that was a new IP? Resistance Fall of Man? 

Get Even came out last year, though I guess that'd be more AA?. For the most part tho def not as common as it should be."

Games,This sounds like the kind of wonderful time where unnecessary mechanics and complexion for the sake of complexion was being removed to streamline games for a better focus on actually fun elements.
Games,"I'm kind of confused as to how this is ""when consoles were ruining video games"" because quite literally every game here except Thief 2 was on consoles. "
52book,"So last week I finished up **It Devours!, by Joesph Fink and Jeffery Cranor**. Really loved it, thought it was just as fantastic as the first book. Can't wait for more.

I'm now focused on **The Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch**. So far I've just read the prologue and the first chapter, but I like what I've seen. Since it's on the longer end of what I usually read, I doubt I'll finish it this week.

On the audiobook front I finished **The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry, by Jon Ronson**. I really enjoyed listening to it, and will probably have to hit up Them soon to round out my Ronson reading experience. 

For now my next audiobook is **The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, by Douglas Adams**. Much like the first book I'm really enjoying it."
