PS5,So who's gonna tell him..
PS4Deals,It was about $30 for me in indian store. Sorry for the late reply.
PS4Deals,There's always a chance yes but Black Friday is usually one of the two best sales of the year so I won't hold my breath for it. The regional pricing for my country on the store has this game for even cheaper right now that's why I think it's worth it.

PS4,"Yup, it's cz the system in a way that if there's a seperate ps5 version of a game the save files can't cross over unless patched in by the developer."
PS4,Yes but you can't transfer your save data from the PS4 version to the PS5 version in this case.

That is bs you know at least half of the thousands of BC games won't be given that functionality if it has to be manual work. Only the most popular ones which made lots of money will even bother."

I think I figured it out but wanna ask one thing, for my first time upgrading it converts to a 1:1 ratio depending on my xbox live membership right? After that if I want to upgrade again that would be to a third of xbox live?"
XboxGamePass,Well the upgrade offer ended like last year I searched it up but somehow it's still possible then? Weird

KanojoOkarishimasu,Best way to describe it is she knows what she wants and how to get it with one exception being Kazuya so she doesn't even know why she's doing all this.
KanojoOkarishimasu,Hmm I guess but she's not really evil she's just in the middle.
KanojoOkarishimasu,"Idk why many don't like mami I see her as this unpredictable force of nature in the manga it's just funny to see how petty she can be, out of all the characters in this series you pretty much know what's going on in their heads and how they're gonna act next but Mami is so unpredictable it's fun."
Games,"Time for Persona fans like me to ask Atlus for a PS4 port haha, never played a SMT game before looks interesting."
playstation,"I had almost zero hype for this game, but was bored to tears and saw great reviews so jumped on it, it's really surreal..I won't say I love it overall just yet but it keeps surprising me. Often times in open world games when you don't know what to do next you look at the map and just pick and choose what you're in the mood for which might give you what you want but also let you avoid things you would normally just know aren't for you.

My first day with the game aside from the ever impressive visuals it overall felt just too familiar like I've done this before but my most recent session I decided to just, explore the world. Avoid looking at my mini map as much as possible until it's second nature and it really turned around for me after that. Not knowing where the birds are leading you to and just letting the world guide you to where you wanna go is surprisingly easy to get used to. I like it more and more, and while the climax of the first mythic tale was where everything just clicked and I love that moment in the game, I'll still reserve judgement. Might not be the best game I've played this year but with the prolonged lockdown definitely an immersive one."
PS5,The PS Move filler was a drag tho.
AskReddit,Arthur Morgan
PS5,I just feel like most people here are subconsciously expecting way too much and will inevitably be disappointed. I'd love to be proven wrong but I'd rather have low expectations and be surprised.
PS5,"My god, I get it you're excited but quit pulling numbers outta nowhere. All the games they showed, the design, accessories, all that amounts to 25% ?"
PS5,Chose makoto in both playthroughs of vanilla but had to go yoshizawa route she's just canon.
gifs,Fuck you got me.
Persona5,"Hanging- Jesus, I can't eve-actually wait a sec"
Games,And get Justice to Rank 8 as well as max Faith by that time.
Coronavirus,If you value your life and theirs then do what's best for everyone and refuse to go through with it. You don't wanna take the risk.
Persona5,"Before they enter Shido's palace Kasumi came to Leblanc and had a chat with Ren, Mona and Futaba offering her assistance, Futaba thanks her and mentions she was filled in by Mona about Kasumi's help during Joker's escape so all of them knew about Kasumi's power at that point."
pcgaming,Yeah worth a shot.
pcgaming,Hope you're right
pcgaming,"They've cut back on the number of NPCs on the street tho, even seeing driving gameplay in a street with other cars it doesn't feel nowhere near as lived in."
Games,"Exactly I want areas with dense population and according to some previews I've seen they've definitely cut down on the number of npcs as compared to the first gameplay trailer, even I could see cities at night have the flair but don't feel *alive* almost like it's kinda empty."
cyberpunkgame,If you collect 7 balls then they'll make a hologram of a wish granting dragon.
TowerofGod,Slight hint of Urek elevates this pic to GOAT.
Games,"Supposedly that's why they delayed their next few big games to fix that issue we'll see what happens, tho even with their samey looking games they're usually well made, relatively bug free, and enjoyable."
Games,Heard Ubisoft is pretty good with their schedule and don't really support crunch.
Games,After the first dungeon is when the game opens up so try to see if you like the game at that point.
anime," I felt like Fujiwara getting her mouth taped while watching others drop mega hints themselves the whole time, I can finally say it, FUCK RACHEL!"
Games,Cancelled co-op game from WB games?
anime,Waited years I can wait till Jan.
dankmemes,If by 'jets left' you mean drifts left then try blowing air at the stick for a bit i saw that online and tried a week ago and surprisingly it fixed itself.
yakuzagames,I'm hoping they skip a P4 Arena style game I mean we did get a direct sequel to 5's story so maybe it works out as in the number of times they milked it.
yakuzagames,Hoping for persona 6 I'm ready to be disappointed with a Scramble localisation tho.
PS4,Although I'm glad people are loving the game I do hope there are some changes to the culture at naughty dog regarding crunch. Even though many there prefer to do that and regard themselves as perfectionists it can't keep going on like this and I'd rather they add an extra year to the dev cycle and get more breathing room instead of them running out of passion for the industry.
PERSoNA,I'm playing through P5R rn and have played P5 two times prior are there any changes to how the game functions in this? Like they really increased the amount of time you could have to max out confidants is it the same in golden?
anime,Return of Papagane! Seriously steals the show every frame he's in. And I cannot wait for next week it can possibly be the most emotional episode yet if they give it the time if deserves and not rush certain parts like this one.
Kaguya_sama,I've been waiting for this episode all season I thought dio was next week but we got return of PAPAGANE!
PS5,"That's true for everyone on the same platform plays on the same settings, this will be different, even last gen games like God of war and Red dead 2 had higher resolution options for the updated consoles."
pcgaming,Hmm I'm on my 3rd overall playthrough/first for Persona 5 Royal so I'd actually prefer if they have a Persona 4 golden port or remaster. It's the only title currently that's stuck on a dead platform with no possible emulation anytime soon.
pcgaming,I would love to play any persona game in 60 fps.
PS5,I'm gonna need you to join and leave again on Friday.
PS5,"Dreams 2 letting you make your own actual dreams seemed pretty insane, no more nightmares!"
pcgaming,"It's hard to describe, I never got to the end of it but a 60fps release might make me dip in again and I'd say you should try too it's easily in the best games this gen."
PS5,You're asking in r/ps5 what do you expect? Go to a neutral sub if you want unbias answer.
anime,"Pm me what you wrote that was considered spoiler, I've read the webtoon pretty far along so I'm good just got me curious."
anime,"Slight correction, Bam could already use Shinsu freely since he's an irregular however making a contract was only to act like he is a regular."
PS4,Sure would!
PS4,Anyone else have one?
anime,2nd most anticipated episode for me seeing game of thrones level of backstabbing lol
Kaguya_sama,Now that's a man who knows what he wants.
funny,Oh hello there! **shank**
funny,Time for you to go back wait till next year **stab**
funny,"I did alot of training this last year so I'm definitely gonna get some good kills unlike last time!

Edit: welp. Next year."
anime,I won't say in reply to what kind of question he answered that because it can be a spoiler I think so I'll just say the character will relate to hayasaka in some way.
anime,The author already talked about a character he's going to introduce after about nine volumes so if he's thinking that far ahead it's nowhere near done.
TowerofGod,Our guy is no. 2.
anime,I was gonna wait to binge the season after its over but we got the first visual of UREK FUCKING MAZINO in here?! Ugh I gotta watch this one at least.
Overwatch,Thank you for this I had a good laugh.
anime,"Can't wait for [spoiler](/s ""Urek Mazino"") to show up."
FinalFantasy,I just let the others in my party die so I didn't have to micro manage their movements often and I killed him using Cloud first try. I guess I got lucky I learnt his pattern quickly.

PS5,If not discord I would prefer updating the PS Messages app to have Party chat integration so I can talk with people without having to boot up my console.
Android,"Go wherever you want, do whatever you want."
Android,It just works.
cyberpunkgame,Ever since I've played Yakuza 0 I truly don't care about a game's size and prefer playing in a smaller space so I can learn my way around the map without looking at the map.
PS5,Different strokes for different folks I'm in.
FFVIIRemake,Rufus second phase reminded me of Father Gasgoine from Bloodborne then promptly got my ass kicked going in trying to stun him lol.
FFVIIRemake,What's the item name?
FFVIIRemake,For real?!
FFVIIRemake,Damn I thought I was the only one struggling with that Pie thing I went up there all smug like what are these tiny things gonna do and he whopped my ass 2 times.
PS4Deals,Not really ToP was a series of fights without long form of story connecting them. I can see it being around 5 hours.

MasamuneKunNoRevenge,What's the name of the comedy manga
Games,Hmm would you recommend I just read or watch a summary of the original plot upto the exit from Midgar before playing this game?
Games,"Whoa that's not what I expected to hear, that's strange it starts from the same point as the original but somehow takes place after it?"
FFVIIRemake,"Happened to me before for releases like DBZ kakarot and Death Stranding, just make sure to restore licences on the account you bought the game on and wait till release, the lock will disappear when the time comes."
Persona5,"I'm not that knowledgeable on fusing persona, how do you get this ability?"
SquaredCircle,WrestleMania 31 can't forget that RKO!
Games,Awesome! Can't wait to get my hands on it.
OreGairuSNAFU,The season 1 design was better no matter how much better animation season 2 had.
Games,Ohh I see I guess die hard fans are gonna be resistant to any form of change. Hope you enjoy the rest of the game! Thanks for clarifying.
Games,That's good to hear! Hope you continue to enjoy the game man.
Games,"No spoilers as in the things that got leaked from early streams or gameplay of the game, been hearing mixed things about the changes they've made to the story. I've never played the original however I still want the new version of the story be on par with the quality of the original."
Games,"I've never played the original so it'll be new to me, just want the game to be as good as possible according to modern game design."
Games,"That's good to hear, I was hearing some people were really turned off by the spoilers coming outta the story."
patientgamers,"If someone here is wondering about the quality of side content, you can recruit a living chicken to your workforce and fight zombies protecting knock off Micheal Jackson as he moon walks through an empty street for his latest music video."
Games,Thoughts on the game so far?
Games,"Man, if you are a fan of RPGs or expansive stories in general you're gonna love this game. I can't say enough good things about it, while there were some definite flaws with the original I haven't been able to play this version but I've heard it's only gotten better.  It released at possibly the perfect time when people have nothing better going on atm just jump on it. Stick with the first dungeon it can be slow because there are a decent number of systems at play but once you get familiar with them quoting Todd Howard - ""It just works""."
anime,I've been waiting for the entire second cour to finish before catching up but glad to hear Bones did this episode justice. Next season gonna be twice as good!

cyberpunkgame,I know it's backwards compatible but they haven't yet revealed if the games will work just as they did on PS4 and you have to buy a PS5 version for improvements or all the enchancements that are possible with the console will be automatically applied on the ps4 copy. So I'm gonna assume it's the former cz money.
cyberpunkgame,I was JUST saying/willing to bet there's no way this game is meeting it's deadline with the way they haven't shown any new footage but wtf all the way to September do you guys realise how close it is to next gen? At this point screw it I'll just get it on next gen by waiting a couple more months.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,Nah that's be like a Japanese rip off of marvel and dc who would wanna watch that

BokuNoHeroAcademia,"He did smile before punching him, it was very subtle."

In some skins, Widowmaker has a tattoo which wraps around her right arm which reads ""araignée du soir, cauchemar""; it means ""evening spider, nightmare"" in French.

Games,"Digital purchases increase year over year as people get better internet and physical media declines in relevancy, it's more of a testament to this change than game getting higher sales cz it's actually good."
PS5,"No problem I totally get that, for what it's worth I used to despise turn bases combat tried it various times before but this game does a good job of bring it into modern times and I love it, still haven't liked any turn based since."
PS5,"Japanese highschool simulator during the day which involves upgrading your character relationships with your team which affects it's dungeon crawling aspect during the night, best to see some trailers or gameplay but it's easy to get spoiled. Just a way to spice things up since I see a lot of Western RPGs here this JRPG is a good palette cleanser."
PS5,I don't see persona 5 on this list
u_SrGrafo,"Nope look at its mods, he's not one of them"
u_SrGrafo,Only the 6th remains and he's completed the gauntlet
AskReddit,You should look up any upgrades some might actually work.
PS4,I completely forgot that's a thing lmao
PS4,Yeah I've been able to avoid voidouts on hard but in a few close calls it's definitely been a lot faster than what the guy is suggesting here
PS4,I just wanna ask is there any story scene I'm missing by not creating a void out? I've never lost to a BT yet so I don't know if that's a thing that can happen anytime or a specific story beat.
DeathStranding,"This is one part of the game I really love and ready all the comments here I'm like feeling super bad over not contributing enough in the lake knot city area hope those roads aren't ready next time I play, gotta build em all!"
anime,I'll follow you lol
anime,Fr
PS4,"Just stick to Amazon, Flipkart is not trustworthy."
DC_Cinematic,"I'll tell you what you get, you get what you fucking deserve!"
pcgaming,"
# insist?"
Games,Would you recommend if I've never played an CRPG? No idea what it is
anime,Alright my bad :(
Persona5,Had something very similar a few years ago this looks better than ever.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,"Regarding the bullets notice how Magician guy was saying ""He can't use his quirk"" right after being hit with the bullet, won't be surprised if he can somehow stop someone from using their quirk with those bullets? Honestly they look more like darts than bullets to me with the needle but everyone is saying bullets so."
anime,Wait what? You're really blowing my mind rn..
anime,I actually just starting reading the manga after s1 *today*. Should have done it sooner.
DestinyTheGame,What is more synthesizer? Is gamit armor different than normal?
anime,Fuck yes.
anime,Oh this is gonna be fun I wanna see new watcher's reactions.
theouterworlds,Things like narrative is subjective
Overwatch,"
:)"
Overwatch,Thanks man:)  I've been doing this for long while I'll keep doing it for those who ask. Also I made a major error in previous message I meant to say I'm *not* against such an idea.
Overwatch,"I'm not against such an idea but these lore bits aren't centralised at one place for me so it'll take me a while. Maybe one day I'll make a special post on this sub detailing all the lesser known facts. I'll let you know if that happens.

Edit: Typo"
Overwatch,"I've not counted, but it's not that there aren't many interesting things about these characters, it's just blizzard is really bad at making that info easy to access. Thus I aim to rectify that, one random lore fact at a time."
Overwatch,"It's a pleasure to spread lore, doing Micheal Chu's job for him."
Overwatch,"Zenyatta is primarily inspired by Shaolin monks, The dots on his head is a Jieba, a symbol representing the three gems of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha; the three vows of abandoning bad behavior, having wisdom to release others from suffering, and creating goodness; and the three trainings of discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

His orbs symbolize the nine chakras (the tenth chakra is outside the body). The word means circle, which may be why it's a necklace."
Overwatch,Make sure to print enough pamphlets.
Overwatch,"I've played just as long as you have, dude it's time to start moving on. I was addicted to the game and for 3 years if I had access to ps4 3 days won't go by without me putting in at least a few hours into overwatch and even that is a safe estimate. Longest game I've ever played and I love it but I am finally burnt out. I don't know if it's the fault of the game/devs frankly I don't care the reason which is why I don't think I'll go back to the way I used to play it. Even if they release a new game in the series I'll play it a bunch but this game as it is now is gonna need nothing less than a core refresh to the fundamentals to feel different enough that I'd wanna play when I'm alone. Until then I'll just play it with the friends I have who still play this."
PS4,Oh now I understand a yes you can. I think I was just tired asf to understand before but have fun 😅 also I have mhw too but haven't started what's your psn dm me?
PS4,Kinda confusing for me sorry if your Phillipines region gets Japan copies then does your store show Japanese Yen as Currency? If you bought small add-ons that work I don't see any reason as to why Iceborne won't work if you buy from that same account.
PS4,"Phillippines, then you have to buy any dlc from Philippines region account."
PS4,Which region account did you buy the main game from?
freefolk,This thread is now Canon.
DestinyTheGame,Better than messing around having no idea what's going on and which system does what lol I'm in.
DestinyTheGame,"How do you 'select' a modifier on an item? Does it just give the option? I haven't reached endgame yet, also

 >obtain another powerful (pinnacle?) reward.

Do you mean you get one powerful reward for completing the nightfall plus another one if you reach 100k score?

Thx for the reply btw"
DestinyTheGame,Oh I think I kinda get it thanks
DestinyTheGame,*This is nice* now carry me in raid.
DestinyTheGame,Sorry I don't understand this terminology 100k what? Heavyweight what? :(
gaming,"Rumors say they were, it got canned."
pcgaming,Jeez clean yourself it's everywhere!
anime,Yeah.. people thought it's a dead series cz of that so didn't buy the BD when it came and now I don't think anyone will be willing to after the whole isekai boom.
DestinyTheGame,"I guess one of my issues is I don't know what 'build' is the perfect balance of fun and effective, doesn't matter if a gun is OP if it's unsatisfying to use that coupled with not being able to navigate the systems as efficiently as I would like to makes me think I'm playing it wrong."
DestinyTheGame,"So can I ask what's the main way to get steps for exotics after the campaigns are over? Even tho I played at launch I quit right after Osiris and there are a lot of new systems (what are Triumphs, Collections, Pursuits, seasonal artififacts, ornament, universal ornaments, how is fusing improved) Don't have a clan or people who play the game and Google can only tell you so much.  I *think* I know what some of them do by just playing but not being able to play the game consistently really makes you feel inferior in terms of knowledge.. Sorry if these things are really obvious I'm just trying to enjoy the game on my own. Honestly wish I could find a clan for noobs."
movies,Ah man you reminded me of how criminally low it made at the theaters I loved it even if I didn't complete the first one. It was a bit dragging at times so I get why people didn't flock to it but still it didn't deserve that low earnings.
Games,Real shit? Wow
anime_irl,Yarr
anime,"Ah that reminds me still no season 3, gonna go die now."
pcgaming,"But it's how the genre works, I'm with you when it comes to gameplay affecting monetisation but that means when the problem is created due to greed and solution is sold for a price but in terms of fairly priced fighting games selling about 5 or so characters for a game with at least 72 characters at launch, if that's the only way they are monetising the game to keep the game online long term I can live with that. Now when it comes to titles like Mk 11 I agree with you because they go way overboard for what should be acceptable or even ethical."
pcgaming,Hmm not exactly they take months to release each fighter and character dlc have never been egregious as long as the base game had enough content which I don't hear complains about smash when it came out.
pcgaming,In case of FROM it was only a marketing deal and Activision had no hand in funding of the game so they had no control. Even Nintendo has started to experiment with it on mobile that's how it started for Bethesda too remember Fallout Shelter?
raimimemes,Yes
movies,For u/tphantom1
movies,It would be incredibly painful.
DestinyTheGame,Thanks for taking the time for all that man it really helped.
DestinyTheGame,"Can you describe what is 2.0 gear? Been away from the game for a long time just after Osiris came out and dong understand many terminology like random rolls, masterwork, main problem in destiny for me was always not knowing the best way to increase power"
DestinyTheGame,Let's gooo
Overwatch,oui c'est assez cool!
Overwatch,Because french
Overwatch,"In some skins, Widowmaker has a tattoo which wraps around her right arm which reads ""araignée du soir, cauchemar""; it means ""evening spider, nightmare"" in French. This is a play on the second half of a common French superstition: ""araignée du matin, chagrin, araignée du midi, souci, araignée du soir, espoir"" which translates to ""morning spider, grief, midday spider, worry, evening spider, hope."
Overwatch,Username checks out
supergirlTV,Well helloo there
Games,It's good stuff just wasn't worth the price they originally came out for
PS4,If you wanna get into rpg then start slowly go with Persona 5 I'm not just saying it cz I love the game and I've not played any DQ game but like others here have pointed out it's very slow game and it's classic JRPG in every sense of the word. I *can* tell you P5 will be very beginner friendly and will have a smooth turn based combat something I've never liked in any other game before. I can't speak for the quality of DQ 11 but this is my perspective.
theouterworlds,"If that's a problem then why do people come to this sub to talk about how hyped and excited they are, how it's gonna be the best thing ever for a game that they haven't even played yet. In a public forum you will see both positive and negative opinions and discussion chose to ignore what you want but don't expect others to stop."
u_SrGrafo,The purple cake delivery man
anime,"""I acknowledge the council has made their decision but since it's a stupid ass decision I've decided to ignore it""
                                  -Japan (Probably)"
gaming,Or my axe
PS4Deals,Don't worry each persona game is completely self contained the only character that crosses over is just there to give the game a thematic consistency you meet him like you meet any new character. I have only played persona 5 and there is no requirement to play the previous games. It's an excellent jrpg to pick up.
Overwatch,All hail Bobby B the best hog.
PS4,So when can we expect the delay /s excited about it!
Games,Yeah..as bad as I feel for doing it..I think persona is gonna have to wait.
