arkhamhorrorlcg,"Every Deluxe expansion requires only a core set to play. 

Bless/Curse are entirely on player cards, so you only need to as hard into the mechanic as you want. Even Curse, you entirely buy into. Only Sister Mary innately played with Bless tokens. Everyone else does their own thing. 

That said, it can feel more complex on the front end and it does deviate from the usual Chaos Bag math. It's still built on the same premise as every other deluxe though. It's also typically easier to buy into the current expansion than it is to find reprints- especially in the current epoch, demand is higher than supply."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"You're really going to be getting the worst of both worlds with this one. It's going to slow to a grind unless you've all played enough to be on top of your turns, and if they haven't played before, it's a very bad introduction to the game. 3rd Edition, Eldritch, even Elder Sign support higher player counts.

spiritisland,I had to resleeve my Invader cards that were in FFG Reds. They were slightly too tall and stuck above their slot too high. I had another brand on hand by chance (Mayday) and they're noticeably shorter.

spiritisland,"4 of 6 Thematic boards came out before Badlands. It makes more sense to be internally consistent and have the cardboard boards lack Badlands setup tokens and then have the rulebook correct it, than to have 2 of 6 cardboard boards be accurate and the other 4 need the errata because you can randomize the boards on the flip side. The mat has marks because it's the most recent and permanent version of the 6p thematic map. 

It's not a different game. Cardboard has one additional setup step. Neoprene has one fewer. If instructions are followed, playmat and normal island boards have the same finished setup results."

arkhamhorrorlcg,"Incorrect. Rules reference, page 5, under Campaign play.

>Each card costs experience equal to the card’s level, to a minimum of 1 (purchasing a level zero card still costs 1 experience). The number of pips beneath a card’s cost indicates the card’s level.

Substituting a level 0 card costs 1 exp unless you have Versatile. Upgrading into a Level 1 card costs 1 exp. Lucky Dice costs 10, not 11. Flare costs 1, not 2."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"For the most part the decks are straightforward but very good at what they do. Stella's ""lose often"" ability is absolutely something you can rely on turn to turn. Jacqueline can be a bit resource starved but once you start getting her bag manipulation tricks online she's *extremely* consistent because half the time you're hand picking her tests. Harvey is much the same."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Some new, some old. Stella is a new character entirely, the rest are first timers to the LCG. They're 60 card packs which contain a premade deck and upgrade cards. Some are reprints, some are new versions of familiar cards, some are new entirely. They're meant to be playable right out of the box and have both interesting upgrade options and give new tricks to old characters, such as ***Spirit*** cards in Nathaniel Cho's deck being especially pertinent to Calvin."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The deck lists in the core set, [the rest of which are here](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/31/92/319211ce-89a8-45b0-8832-dfbff548c963/ahc_decklists_v61-compressed.pdf) aren't necessarily good. They're a good enough starting point but the new Starter Decks are very fun right out of the box and they're more consistent- you just have more copies of cards you want to see more often. I'd start with these but definitely take a chance with the Core Set characters, they're still among the favorites in the game."

I make an earnest effort to keep up on new product schedules for stuff, but the threads in question are almost always ""Is X getting a reprint, is Y in-stock online"" etc. They tend to come in waves, and admittedly there aren't many right now but it's been a consistent issue in the past.

COVID withstanding, it used to be far easier to track reprint and release windows before Asmodee changed a lot of things on their end. We simply can't forecast stuff like that easily and most of the responses in the threads are conjecture, my own included."

arkhamhorrorlcg,"Blob doesn't rely on the Group A/B/C designations like Labyrinths. Each table's worth of 1-4 Investigators plays as normal, but the Blob shares a ""global"" health pool that's based on number of players overall, and you have a shared pool of ""Countermeasures"" that all groups can deplete or replenish as you play. Epic doesn't necessarily need a ""proctor"" but someone will have to track the Blob's overall health and the number of Countermeasures available at a given time because all players can access them.

It definitely plays well as a standalone and you won't really miss some of the beats that you would in one-team Labyrinths. It's not as great a difference as LoL."

Sagas don't have campaign aspects such as EXP. The campaign setting came fairly recently. It's a lot more of a traditional cardgame. It pulls characters from all over and has a ton of gameplay options though. You can play a knight in shining armor, or you can sit in the corner and play a weird graveyard recursion combo deck. 

Marvel Champions feels like it took more nods from Lord of  the Rings than Arkham in a lot of aspects, which is far from a bad thing."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"As a long time LotR LCG player, my favorite cards were the ones that let us directly infect the encounter deck- Ranger Summons, Flight of the Eagles, Flight to the Sea, and my personal favorite- Tom Bombadillo! 

[Stargazing](https://arkhamdb.com/card/06027) and The Stars Are Right are the perfect Mystic answer to those cards. Even with just two players, I'll find a way to fit them into my decks. I'm never sorry to see the starts aligning rather than Ancient Evils."

arkhamhorrorlcg,"He did say it was while they were mapping out who would go into which box, so ""they wouldn't put out a box and say oops it's 5 Mystics,"" which would have been before 3e released, one of whom was a new character. It doesn't confirm more characters, only that new characters had to be distributed, which would be Daniela and Stella.

That said, I'd put money on new characters anyway."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I was more alluding to them not doing a bonus, because it'd be lopsided but hard to elaborate without spoilers."
arkhamhorrorlcg,It's likely just for the epilogue. I don't think they'd throw in any big curve balls for the last scenario of half the campaign.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I played solo with Luke and the ability on the Agenda to draw 3, keep all Hidden definitely did the trick. One game does not a pattern make but didn't feel too rough. I'm a little afraid to go back through on solo, that said. I feel like my stars aligned once it came time for Luke to play Pyre and dunk a god into some pillars."
arkhamhorrorlcg,please don't be real please don't be real
boardgames,Cancelled entirely? The FLGS I used to work for has a demo copies. Interesting.

Games,"Mount and Blade is still my favorite weird rabbithole to fall into. It's unwieldy, felt very old design-wise when it came out, but hit all the right chords to resonate with my earliest memories of playing PC games growing up. It's one of those games that I have to push friends to keep up on because the payoff is definitely there. I can't wait to sink my teeth into a new one for the first time again."

Grain of salt I suppose."
arkhamhorrorlcg,Good enough for me.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Didn't confirm the marquee art or the article? When asked to repeat the title, they said the announcement article should be following. Same as they often do after product reveal livestreams.

Edit: Nope, they mentioned posting the key art. My bad. Multitasking on MMO patch days is hard.

https://twitter.com/FFGames/status/1229860422213304320/photo/1"
arkhamhorrorlcg,Article should be going up shortly.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"No, they specifically called out a new *type* of product."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Game of Thrones was licensed and those deals typically don't last longer than they ""need"" to. Game of Thrones' TV run is over, thus the marketing isn't selling itself. 

Arkham Horror LCG was (when I still worked in the industry and had access to numbers) their highest selling, non-licensed product (meaning there's no licensing fees or deals to work out) and on top of that it outsells several of their other licensed products. That is to say, AHLCG is an extremely profitable product. 

I can't speak on their RPGs outside of anecdotal experiences. I played their non-licensed RPGs like End of the World but only at  FFG events and the system was fun enough but not built for campaigns. Star Wars (and by extension Genesys) were easy to sell and demo because it's easy to show why the game appeals to a player (power fantasy) and why it's appealing to a GM (everything modular, granular, easy to organize.) So if it's true that these are getting sunsetted as well, it's going to be a shame but there's no lack of content to keep the games on tables for a long time."
arkhamhorrorlcg,Yeah BCW is what I was blanking on. I live alone so I'm happy to store all of my games in cupboards.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I ended up using UltraPro deckboxes and a ""shoebox"" from storing Magic cards. Can fit two cycles worth of encounters and scenarios in there easily."
Games,"I suppose this gives context to the articles form earlier this week.

spiritisland,"Well, in a sense they do- it's a special ability of certain Adversaries. 

It makes sense thematically as well. The coasts are always a threat to you. If you do your job and ensure that Invaders can't reach the heart of your island by constantly torching their towns and cities, what foothold are they going to be sending more Explorers from? The one you need to destroy (and doing such is your victory condition)."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Not trying to bend the rules we're here to enforce, but afaik Go7 is the only company making inserts for this particular box else I'd highlight those too. 

https://go7gaming.com/product/ahl-001-for-arkham-horror-zealot/

I'm a huge fan of box inserts and I personally store the whole cycle in the ""Return to..."" box once it's released."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"As the name implies, it's an expansion for an expansion. There's a few things going on here. 

1) it's a smaller, sturdy box with dividers for every encounter set in here, so it's a storage solution that's perfectly serviceable. 

2) it's a way to replay older content with a fresh coat of paint, some narrative twists and mechanical changes that let you add another layer of complexity if you sink a lot of time into the game. 

3) it gives new versions of familiar player cards to add more depth to deckbuilding. 

You can absolutely play through the Return To version on your first go but it's not recommended. You can play The Forgotten Age without ever looking at this box and still get the full experience and bang for your buck."
boardgames,"I think it's worth playing one game with them, but moreso so you can learn the turn structure without one more variable to worry about."
spiritisland,"Arkham Horror: the Card Game is my absolute favorite game and definitely scratches a similar itch, but is typically geared toward campaign play (though everything and anything can be played as a standalone), has a ridiculous amount of depth and variety in player abilities and flavor, and is overall a thematic homerun. I can't recommend it enough.


/r/arkhamhorrorlcg"
twilightimperium,The models look so much cleaner with a matte paint too.
spiritisland,"It also lets you stack Wilds tokens for a Dahan's worth of damage later. Yeah, you can pitch it, but it's a good way to canvass with some Wilds before you do so, and Keeper is pretty middle of the road with card plays and energy income. There are few cards, especially in starting hands, that let you directly control where the Branch and Claw tokens get placed. This helps partners too."
spiritisland,"The PnP do have alternate rules but I don't want to dilute that part of the game, at the same time. Not every spirit needs to be powerful and up to snuff but Sharp Fangs just has too great a chance to not *do* stuff."
spiritisland,"Oh absolutely, they synergize very well. I just want to see some more tools for Sharp Fangs to work with. They have to rely on events doing work for them a little too much."
inkarnate,"I was planning on running some Powered by the Apocalypse one-shots and then turning them into a surprise Call of Cthulhu campaign but hey, if there's enough in 5e to do horror, maybe I'll do that instead."
spiritisland,"I wonder if we'll see any powers that help round out Sharp Fangs. Different gameplay and approach, but Many Minds looks to entirely outclass them, based on what we've seen of Many Minds earlier and now the final board."
spiritisland,Scripted Deluxe is the one to look for. It's fantastic.
twilightimperium,"After players know the game and everyone can help pitch in for game setup, playtime gets far more reasonable. Still several hours, but a game of newbies who just don't know enough about the game yet to make choices expediently vs. a group of people who can both make plans quickly and can help just set the damn game up is a big difference. 

As for the podcast boys, they invest a ton more time than the average player. There's still a ""tournament scene"" in that bigger game stores may be able to draw in several groups to play that way, but those people aren't also sitting down at home to make content to be consumed. 

If you're on Facebook, search there or on the subreddit for a local group- there's likely to be something closer than you'd think."

If there's more games that do assymetrical gameplay well, send them my way. Half of **War of the Ring** is on my shelf collecting dust while I procrastinate on painting the minis because that game is illegible as hell."

Edit: Apologize for AutoMod going rampant in what I'm pretty sure was the plot to Halo 4. It has been summarily terminated."
TheAdventureZone,11am EST/8am PST ish
TheAdventureZone,The hard hitting questions
spiritisland,"If you're on Facebook, try making a LFG in the Spirit Island group, a local gaming group, or a store's page. Else we have LFG threads pop up fairly  often on the Twilight Imperium sub, so I'd imagine you could find local people on a subreddit."
boardgames,Is the multiplayer asynchronous or do you have to make lobbies and play a game in a session?
boardgames,"Apologies if it's too off topic, but Google Opinion Rewards gives play store credit for surveys based on google maps history. Selling my soul and data to a megacorp doesn't always feel great but they also already have the data, so whatever. It pays for more expensive games like KotOR but I also just hit $9 again so Terraforming Mars is my next purchase."
TheAdventureZone,It's canon now!
TheAdventureZone,Fog of Love is also a fun party game despite being two player. It's fun to ham it up and rope your audience into caring into the fake fictional couple that the players portray. I highly recommend it.
TheAdventureZone,"Due to Balance's origins, was there any difficulty in sorting out the licensing for the game with other various, corporate entities that may have made an RPG? Or did the graphic novel adaptation smooth that part of it out? 

Was there any inspiration drawn from Phoenix: Dawn Command? RPGs are definitely about collaborative storytelling, but TAZ is a bit tonally different, in that few characters fling themselves into harm's way so eagerly with the exception of Magnus."
TheAdventureZone,ty for telling me I'm cross-posting. Bad bot.
TheAdventureZone,"...okay, I didn't know how badly a need I have for a denim dice bag is. I've got some people to talk to."
arkhamhorrorlcg,Oh agreed. I love that games multiplayer. I was the only one with the collection so deck management was a chore.
Games,"I wanna say late fall? Prior to it I had some stalls when loading into Elite and Boss rooms, moreso with the ones that have to wake up like Hexaghost, but I haven't had any noticeable issues in a long time and I play fairly often. I'll try to go out of my way to build a fat deck and see if I can put some strain on it. I could be wrong and anecdotal."
Games,"1) This is part of Xbox Game Pass so if you got it via the holiday deal, do not sleep on this game with or without this patch

2) You need to get at least one ""clear"" up to the Heart of the Spire, so you have time to do #1)

3) for real get this on any platform you use often. It runs perfectly on Switch and everything after a minor performance patch. It's fantastic."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"For us, it's head count. We had an odd number for so long that even though games like KeyForge and Destiny directly appealed to us, it was easier to find engaging Co-Op games that we could play with 3p."
spiritisland,I misread the initial post. My mistake!
spiritisland,The PnP rules tests are on the Kickstarter page for Jagged Earth. It was always meant to be public.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Plenty of people use action/click trackers in this game, whether it's physical or online. You're going to find yourself in the minority here, friend. Keep it civil."
spiritisland,I'd totally help test if you're building it to work on Android/Browser
videos,I was bartending during the game and assumed I misheard the announcement. As a Hawks fan I'm not even mad. Rinne is a hell of a player. It's a fun list to make.
spiritisland,"Doesn't hurt to just skim the deck ahead of time too so you kinda know what you're getting into. I've only had the deck devastate me once or twice but it was playing Ocean, so the Inland was already just a mess and then exploded."
spiritisland,"Once you play the four low-complexity spirits, you can totally crack open B&C. I just did the same last week, and the tools you get in B&C are very intuitive and just give you more options of how to deal with threats. I definitely recommend it (but I also recommend the rules tweak from the Jagged Earth PnP, which is to skip an event card on your first turn)."
spiritisland,"I also haven't dived into scenarios. I played everyone solo against vanilla Invaders just to figure out what a Spirit's tempo and rhythm was like in a vacuum, plus I wanted to know the game well enough to pilot the invader/fear board when playing with my buddies for the first time, which means both playing the game but being able to be an informed rules lawyer. Even the difficulty tables in the rulebooks make upping the difficulty more enticing and less intimidating."
spiritisland,"Once I learned the system itself, Rampant and Shadows Flicker were the ones that got me. I play [a lot of Arkham Horror](r/ArkhamHorrorLCG) so once it clicked that Fear was my Act deck and the clock I'm trying to escalate, the toolboxes of spirits just fell in place. On top of that, the modular difficulty is ingenious. I loved that about Arkham's approach and this just cranks that up to 11."
spiritisland,"Whup, time to read the rule book again!"
spiritisland,Like a pico thing or game/snack anarchist?
spiritisland,Never play Azul with her. They're basically Starburst
spiritisland,"Just curious, was this a Jagged Earth rules tweak?"
HadesTheGame,"I swapped mine to Left Bumper, swapping the Codex and Reload. Feels totally fine for the gun and I've never once accidentally clicked RS at a bad time."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Same policies were carried over from LotR LCG and this was all in response to reports, so yes. I don't speak for the trees."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"If it's a spoiler for a different cycle, a different scenario, or something not immediately relevant to the question, give it context and a spoiler tag."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"More strict for encounter cards than anything in this case. Mostly, let people choose the information they're exposed to when it'd typically be hidden information in-game."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Some people avoid news articles entirely so everything in the pack is new, so even player cards will be a surprise until cracking the pack."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Mystic is definitely king when it comes to control magicks. Blue/White is about not letting your opponent have fun, and Mystic has those tools but without the psychological trauma inflicted upon an opponent."
Games,It's just 4 players against bots but you're pretty well outnumbered. It's intense and games are shorter than some of the more involved modes like Capital Assault. It's only Clone Wars era content (until this update hits and adds Resistance/FO)
magicTCG,"That's not a ""sale."" So yeah, chargeback."
arkhamhorrorlcg,The Greater Good Boi*
PokemonSwordAndShield,It looks like a Bleach villain but I dig it. Way more menacing than the usual palette.

arkhamhorrorlcg,"I really love this synergy in decks like [Minh-finity Stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6lwnrsQCFQ&feature=youtu.be) but it's definitely not a card for everyone, which I can appreciate."

arkhamhorrorlcg,"Welp, I just wrapped up a TCU run with him but once more into the breach I guess. Have to at least try this in a standalone."
arkhamhorrorlcg,Oh I didn't say it's a new issue. I ran two copies then because it was too neat to pass up.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"That one definitely piqued my interest. My one reservation is not knowing what level the upgrades will be at, so it's hard to want to put them in an off-class investigator like Luke. I would swap it out for none exp if it weren't upgradable but there's actions involved too. 

This one's cool at base level at least. Could be worse."

TheAdventureZone,"Podcast apps pull content from a host, so it doesn't matter much which app you use. On Android, I personally use Podcast Addict but my smart speakers at home can access podcasts I subscribe to via Google Play or Spotify, so it's a toss-up."
TheAdventureZone,"Tell your friends. Tell your parents. Unless they're assholes, in which case you don't need that in your life and I'm your dad now."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Having this with Well Maintained is fun if you have the resources for it. AoE damage, self-discards so it goes right back to your hand, and takes no slots."
twilightimperium,The bigger issue was a) the lowest effort memes or b) using the subreddit to send pictures to your friend across the table from you. That's not what this is for and those will still be removed without hesitation.
TheAdventureZone,"""Authorial intent"" requires intent beyond ""Let's play some D&D for paternity leave."" It's definitely more rough but it's kinda nice to have it more goofy and loose. Kind of a mix of how they do live shows."
Games,"At the risk of feeding the trolls, it's a digital adaptation of Fantasy Flight's cooperative card game, which is extremely well received."
TheAdventureZone,I'm also going to hijack the top comment for a minute and ask that feedback on the thread overall be replied to here to keep the rest of the thread on track. Blow up my inbox!
Watchmen,"I'm in the camp that the Mars footage is faked, and he's actually ducked the watchdogs. If those tachyon satellites come back into play, I'll probably end up eating my words."
Watchmen,"I have a hunch that Judd is connected to the KKK/7K ""proper"" and the current group is someone taking their guise, taking actual action when Judd's group is silent and inactive. He'd have motive to take action on the usurpers while being able to not be involved from a Klan perspective."
Watchmen,"If you're still open to applications (though you've gotten quite a few so far) I'll throw my name in the hat. 

Currently an active moderator for r/theadventurezone r/ArkhamHorrorLCG and r/twilightimperium ranging from 10k-70k users. As such I'm highly active and babysit my modqueue and new threads constantly. 

As for Watchmen, I started with the graphic novel in probably middle school, followed by the movie (which I still love as an adaptation) and now the show. I played the first episode of the game that released on 360 but didn't stick with it, I'll admit. 

I'm definitely not afraid of spoilers, if it helps."
politics,Going nowhere fast.
marvelchampionslcg,Seconded. Give some time for cards to have been played. Early evaluations are likely to be thrown out the window after some actual play.
boardgames,"It's a full, standalone game. Rather than playing a character (Flash/Ox, Paladin/Cleric) you play a Family that has different stat distributions. As you play, you flip your character card over, record your name, your character's fate, their age, etc. Each scenario loosely follows a storyline and will add in new items, omens, events, tiles, etc. As people die, you put Ghost stickers on room tiles to show it getting more haunted. You turn items into family heirlooms so when you possess them, they give you bonus effects. It's fun as hell.

Most importantly, it was playtested and went through QA. There's more balance, less things outright broken, and a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. It's phenomenal. 

We also sing/chant every time we open the box and take something out of it. No spoilers. The game's meta and absurd at times. 10/10."
Watchmen,He and Thomas Middleditch look like they came from the same character creator.
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The taboo is absolutely valid and feels good. It may have come too late though- outside of Dunwich (and I haven't tried it in Return to) campaigns are FAR more generous with exp. It used to be an auto-include but even in blind campaigns I don't feel it's necessary often. We used *maybe* two of them in our entire Iron Man run this year and by the end of the campaign we were just buying permanents for fun. I don't see the need to carry this beyond scenario 3 of like, any campaign. 

Still love the hell out of it."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The deckbuilding aspect can definitely be intimidating. There's a lot to keep track of and it's easy to get lost when there's a lot of information out there. There are a lot of good, beginner friendly resources like [guides about how to build a deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/7506/beginner-deckbuilding-guide-for-zoey-with-daisy-1.0) or just deck lists that are either beginner friendly or meant to be built with fewer sets of cards [like these ones here.](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/714/roland-you-can-bank-on-me-beginner-friendly-demo-set-1.0)

I really enjoy Elder Sign- I use it to trojan horse Arkham games to a table because everyone likes Yahtzee and everyone is better than me at it. I'll still bust it out and play myself too- it's fun, it's lightweight, and it's a short enough game that if I lose, it's not too big a loss. 

I'm a bit biased but I'd say stick with it. Arkham Horror games are some of my favorite cooperative experiences."
arkhamhorrorlcg,Silas is over here getting bomb after bomb in ***Innate*** cards and Mateo's over here with [new ***Blessed*** cards](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/f8/f1/f8f1df90-ef26-4cf6-bf14-f8bd975e0486/ahc42_a2_card_a-glimmer-of-hope.png) wondering what a trait is.
boardgames,"Tangentially related, I stopped playing Clash Royale when my buddy did because we kept each other interested and accountable. I started playing Dota Underlords' duo mode with him on and off and it was like riding a bike, It takes a while to learn but having the shared strategies like the old days felt so damn good."
boardgames,"If you haven't played it yet, I highly suggest Betrayal Legacy- it's straight up one of the best game experiences I've had. I've always enjoyed the games though I always have to give people the disclaimer that they can be pretty busted and you have to infer you way through some stuff, but Betrayal Legacy has been an absolute delight every step of the way. I haven't even had the same players every time- a core two or three but the rest rotated in and out."
boardgames,"[Arkham Horror: the Card Game](/r/arkhamhorrorlcg ). I just started up a two-handed game of the Circle Undone cycle with Roland Banks and Jim Culver, even though I have another active campaign with my buddies. We had a few other friends join us for a few weeks in a row at our weekly game night so we were happy to pause our campaign and play with some old friends."
underlords,"It'd have been more interesting if it downgraded the alliance tier bonus for Knights, artificially capping you at L2."
marvelchampionslcg,"I don't believe these rules were in the Learn to Play. We had to infer what would happen based on Lord of the Rings and then check the rules reference from there. If you would draw an encounter card from an empty deck, you cycle it and accelerate the scheme. If you're dealing out boost cards and come up short, you're in luck."

TheAdventureZone,Rule 3. Keep it civil.
arkhamhorrorlcg,I didn't get a chance to touch base with you guys after Matt and Jeremy put us through the gauntlet- we got as far as the Keeper himself but Matt had tasted blood from his first player elimination. Thanks again for the cool promos and all the work you've put in!
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The Blob absolutely nails the Sci-fi B-Movie theme and has a very gamey feel, which I can't expand on without spoilers. Heavy clue gathering is rewarded just as much as big gun dakka, and it's less prone to people not ""getting it"" as Labyrinths. My usual play group hasn't done it yet so I'm excited to get them in on it, and some of the things the Blob can devour is fantastic- at Nights, Scott of the Mythos Busters had to text his wife that the Blob ate his phone when we did a smaller epic game. 

I haven't played Excelsior yet because of schedules but I did peek and I'm getting too eager to wait at this point."
Watchmen,That glimpse on Mars and the juxtaposition with the eggs gave me the vibe that Manhattan isn't all he's cracked up to be but maybe I misread it.
underlords,Jail sounds cool as hell. I'm hoping it's easier or faster to see the roster and know at a glance who's available and who's who. I don't play DotA at all so the actual heroes are unknown to me outside of this game's context.
boardgames,"I've had zero issues with ""reddit is fun"" over the years and even its mod tools are entirely adequate. I get most of my usage out of it unless I'm working on a project."

boardgames,"""Content complete"" is more accurate and doesn't have a needlessly negative connotation."
boardgames,They just got reprinted. They're available on FFG still. Miniature Market sold out real quick.
DestinyTheGame,Can I just say how buckwild of a sentence that is? And that it makes 100% sense?
DestinyTheGame,Upgrade Armor
weatherfactory,I've got maybe two hours of playtime under my belt but I love being subscribed here because I have *no fucking clue what anything means*.
DestinyTheGame,It's available through a quest chain from Banshee. Just got it on my vet.
DestinyTheGame,"See you on the other side, Guardians. Maybe when those paychecks come through."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"You can have three copies of a card with Myriad, rather than just two, and when you purchase one with EXP you may take the two additional copies at no exp cost (3 for the price of 1)."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"**Swarming X:**

An enemy with the swarming X keyword is actually a pack of enemies operating in unison. After you put an enemy with the swarming X keyword into play, place the top X cards of your deck facedown underneath the enemy as swarm cards, without looking at them. The enemy they are underneath is called the ""host enemy."" Some scenario card effects may also instruct a player to add swarm cards to an enemy. This is done using the same process. 

* If it's ever unclear which investigator should add swarm cards, the lead investigator does so.

* Each swarm card underneath the host enemy acts as a separate instance of that enemy for most purposes. Each swarm card has the same values and text as its host card. *(For example, if an investigator is engaged with a host enemy with 2 swarm cards underneath it, that investigator is engaged with 3 enemies total.)*

* Each swarm card attacks separately when enemies attack during the enemy phase. Once the host enemy and all of its swarm cards have attacked during this step, exhaust all of them.

* Each swarm card can be attacked or dealt damage separately, but the host enemy cannot be defeated while it still has swarm cards underneath it. When a swarm card is defeated, any excess damage may be dealt to another swarm card underneath the same host enemy or the host enemy itself. *( Example text, yadda yadda)*

* Anytime a swarm card leaves play, place it on the bottom of its owner's deck. If you're unsure of the owner of the swarm card, you may look  at it to determine its owner.

* The host enemy and all of its swarm cards move, engage, and exhaust as a single entity."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"To paraphrase, you put cards from the top of your library underneath the Swarm creature as extra copies of the creature, without looking at what cards you milled. Each counts as an extra copy of the creature, but they attack and engage the same target. You have to kill it an additional time for each cars tucked underneath buuuut cards like Dynamite Blast and Storm of Souls work exactly how you hope they would 🙃

I'm at work for a bit but I can post the exact rule if the PDF isn't live by then."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"The limitations are on reddit- only two threads can be stickied, and to be quite frank, discussion threads for current releases takes precedence. With the transition from old reddit to the reddit redesign, a lot of these threads also got miscommuted- different mobile apps pull from old reddit, such as ""reddit is fun"" whereas the official app uses the redesign (which is an entirely different subreddit, as far as the backend and content is concerned.) It's two sidebars to curate, two sets of header images, two sets of flairs. 

I wrote a [buyer's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/arkhamhorrorlcg/comments/7o0q55/how_to_buy_arkham_horror_a_beginners_guide/) about a year ago that seems to have been lost in translation that's got a lot of this info already but reddit doesn't make the task of searching easy.

Sidebar updates and wiki updates are in the work and have been heavily discussed elsewhere, but this and a compilation of community contributors are the top of the list."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"I'm running it in my blind Diana run for TCU along with Sign Magicks, some guns, and Mists/Sixth Sense/Rite of Seeking because I'm a jackass. I'm not sure it's worth it yet and it's on the short list of things to kick out. Hasn't slowed me down or gotten awkward yet."
TheAdventureZone,What mystery?
monsteroftheweek,Page numbers separated by commas when printing. Seems like you have it sorted but it's really handy to know.
underlords,Conceptually they're just in a weird spot. Adjusting ranges lets the contraption find a niche and then values can get tweaked.

arkhamhorrorlcg,This is just an announcement/reminder. Actual thread will go up tomorrow morning.
arkhamhorrorlcg,Those don't allow you to outright lose experience from your accumulated total. I think the only thing that would be a loss of EXP would be if you bought into a side-quest standalone scenario and then did *real* bad.

arkhamhorrorlcg,"Uncased, the tokens just clump up like a roll of coins in the bottom of a bag. It was just awkward. Capsules are 100% the best improvement so far. I think I'd rather have unsleeved cards than bare tokens at this point."
Fireteams,"I need it too, and badly. If not tonight, we should get a group together for it."
arkhamhorrorlcg,"Gameplay-wise, the Secret Name didn't do anything out of the ordinary but the way the Encounter deck treats you is oppressive in a cool way. It piles up and weighs you down. It was a neat alternative to enemies gumming up locations. It doesn't necessarily stand out from the rest but it was pretty good still."
