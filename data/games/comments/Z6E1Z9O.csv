Monitors are also priced relatively close to the us msrp too. 

Some Pc parts however, their prices are ridiculous as you see here, while others are interestingly not so bad.

The good thing however, is that we have an extremely good consumer protection laws (almost on par with europe) so every electronic device gets a 2 year warranty (iphone extended warranty without getting apple+, yay!)"

Games,"""smart delivery"" is just a marketing name and microsoft isnt forcing anything on developers and so far every single ""smart delivery"" game has been also confirmed for the ps5

The ps5 also has full backwards compatibility for ps4 games and the reason the ds4 doesnt  work on ps5 games Is because the ds5 has more features than it, unlike the xbox new controller which virtually has no new features.

In short, walking around malls/stores of any kind here you wouldnt notice a difference between them and their north american/european counterparts, we have no specialized in store or out of store ads for women ( no abayas and such unless you enter a store that sell abayas of course  ) and it has been this way for a long time now.


As for lego and other toys, We have had barbie dolls and the like since 40-50 years ago and it wasnt touched in any way ( we actually have the european versions) and the same goes for lego, we had lego since toys r us opened their first store here in 1996 and we actually had the Western versions, its just that now we have an official store.

I really hope that western media shows more of our country instead of criticizing its politics, since we have made so many improvements in the recent years in regards to human rights and especially women as they have basically all the rights that men hold now which is extremely welcome.

Im sorry for the long walls of text but i hope i answered your question in as much detail as possible, and feel free to ask more!"

Thanks again!"

Im extremely excited for the i/o improvements and how it will shape the future of games, and as a mainly pc gamer, how it will also affect the pc tech space.

Thanks cerny!"
PS5,"Mark cerny clearly stated that 2.23ghz will be the be almost constant aside from some highly intensive games and even then the speed will only be down by a couple percent to reduce about %10 of power consumption.

And powerwise, while the xbox has more CU’s 
The ps5 has 400 more mghz of speed which doesnt only affect the speed of CU’s, but as cerny stated it will affect every part of gpu like the cache and rt cores and such which will stay at 1.835ghz in the xbox so that actually closes the gap and may make the 2 consoles even less than %10 apart in power"
PS5,"Man, i never thought i would be this excited for a youtube video."
PS5,That “trash” you are talking about has an ssd faster than any high end ssd available on pc right now and is about 2.3 times faster than the one in the xbox series x while the difference in power between the consoles will likely not be more than %10

This happens to be the same way you can launch steam big picture mode with which means that everyday i have to launch this mode and get scared by the annoyingly high launch sound and get through the pain to exit it.

but since my xbox one’s performance basically sucks (frame drops and such) i really wanted to play its exclusives on pc and in happy that microsoft made my wish come true."
PS5,"The problem with the xbox is that as a pc owner I literally have no reason to own one, i mean every exclusive is there on pc, and there is also gamepass on pc, why would i waste money on an xbox?

nvidia,"Thats why we dont “save it” it works as a payment to the government, it works like insurance, you dont pay a lot but when an accident happens you get reimbursed way more than the value you have ever paid

So for example lets say your income is $60k, the government takes about %6 which is $3600 every year however when you retire you get paid $60k per year till you die, lets say you worked for 40 years which is equals to $144k paid to the government, if it was considered as a saving account you would only get your normal income for 2 years only and then you get nothing, so it is basically a bargain"
nvidia,"And why is it “yikes”?

Maybe you didnt understand how it works, basically the government take about %6 of your income and use it as fund to give retirees and when you are 60(retired) you get your whole salary every month till you die without working a second"

Yes we can be anything other than muslim and all these myths about beheading ex muslims is just a law that have never been enforced

And Why would we protest our government? There are literally no reason to.

One of my best friends is openly gay and has a group of friends who is also gay and he studies with me in university and again, nobody cares

This law is actually in many muslim countries as it is haram/prohibited for muslim women to marry non muslim guys so that has nothing to do with our government

Basically when you are aiming down sights or bringing the gun close to your face the tracking will really struggle and therefore breaks immersion and may get you killed but if you put your hands a little bit further you will not have any problems

Also shooter games like pavlov/contractors/onwards have added a new option called “virtual stock” which eliminates the problem %90 of the time and as a bonus it makes your aiming better since you only need to move one controller and shoot with the other

Happy to help!"
virtualreality,"The tracking problems if fixed would make the rift s the best current headset on the market after the index and maybe the vive pro

I would suggest that you wait for oculus to fix the problems and see if the fixes are good enough or not.
if it is,or if they allowed the use of the original rift’s sensor together with the insight tracking system i would surely go for the rift s"
virtualreality,"I have both the rift s and the vive

Tracking wise the vive is better as it actually works decently in fps and bow games
And the fov seem wider on the vive

However,the controllers and screen quality are enough to put the vive to shame


Personally i would choose the rift s"
Games,Yes! I love this series.
oculus,My question is:is the experience playing with the stock 100€ better? Or is it just one of these things that would be nice to have but not a game changer?
oculus,"I can actually get the s cups bundled with the tube and magtubes for only €100

However,what makes you say that the tracking wouldnt work very well with the stock? Did you see the video?

Thanks!"
oculus,"Yeah,€100 aint cheap...."
oculus,"Im considering printing them but i just want to know if there are any issues with tracking in fps games and does this fix them on the rift s?

Thanks!"
oculus,"Looks good!

Will these fix the tracking issues on the rift s?"
oculus,So you are suggesting that i buy the $30 set?
oculus,"I see that they sell 2 kinds of covers

The vr cover and the basic set, which one of them is the recommended one that i should buy when they open up orders?

Thanks!"
oculus,"Currently there only about 50 players ingame

So yeah....i dont think it has an active playerbase,but playing with bots is fun too!"
nvidia,Rtx 2090?
nvidia,The more you save!
oculus,"You can get the plano lenses+adapters for $38
I think thats the cheapest you can get the adapters for"
oculus,"Im not receiving my headset till may 26th and these posts give me a hard time staying hyped,i hope it is just exaggerating 


=("
Windows10,"Unplug all of your drives other than the C drive,this happened to me many times before"
oculus,RemindMe! 4 hours
oculus,Ordered from amazon uk too and the order still shows (not yet dispatched)
oculus,"I live in saudi arabia too and i ordered the rift s from amazon.uk,it states that i will get it 28 may - june 3 but hopefully we will get our orders sooner!"
oculus,You can buy oculus go’s inserts from widmo vr and it will work with the rift s!
oculus,Oculus home and steam is all you need!
oculus,"Yeah it used to scare me too but eventually you will get used to it =D

Hope you get your headset as soon as possible and have fun with it!"
oculus,"Man,dont give up that easily!

In my pc it says “ does not ship to saudi arabja” but i pre ordered it with no problems,

Just add the headset in your basket/cart and then check out and you will be able to order it, dont care about the red text that says you cant on the item’s page!"
oculus,"Amazon uk and amazon.de opened orders, i ordered from amazon.uk since they canceled my amazon.jp order and it worked! You should try there"

I just ordered it and it actually ships outside japan (i live in saudi arabia)"
oculus,I tried best buy and amazon and they both dont ship to other countries =(
oculus,Does not ship to saudi arabia either even tho nearly every single other thing does

ValveIndex,"I only have one pair of glasses only, but as i said earlier the sde and also something that i forgot to mention which is the controllers as i really didnt feel comfortable holding it since my hands are on the smaller side made my decision to return the headset and wait for gen 2/1.5 easier,an here im!part of the valve index hype train."
ValveIndex,"I actually had the rift before the vive,and my nose still hates me for it...."
ValveIndex,"I actually had the vive but it was really uncomfortable with glasses,combined with the really bad sde i decided to return it, so i returned it"
ValveIndex,"I want to know the answer for this as well as i live in the middle east and i would really love to buy the index,otherwise i have to settle for the rift s =("
ValveIndex,"The problem is that the tracking of wmr headsets are no where as good as lighthouse tracking,as it has so many dead zones so i dont think valve will allow this as they want to provide the best experience possible."
ValveIndex,"I dont think it will have inside out tracking,as it only has 2 cameras that is intended for passthrough.

Also,lcd panels are really good these days especially for eliminating sde and reducing the cost of the headset.

I really hope the price is about $600 for the full package and they ship it internationally(which is unlikely =( ) so i can get it as i dont live in europe/us."
starcitizen,A package with every ship in the game that costs about $25000
ValveIndex,"Yeah when i search for the index in the steam store i cant find anything, but googling it gives me the steam page"
ValveIndex,Yup! But remember that we dint know the specs yet(of the index).
ValveIndex,6 days and we will know everything!
ValveIndex,"We dont know the price yet! But i would really love to have a fov of more than 90 degrees,so im staying here for the time being =)"
ValveIndex,"Okay fine! I will pay whatever they want,but i gotta sell my ps4 first"
ValveIndex,"In willing to increase my budget to $619 but thats it,no more money will be spent!(hopefully...)"
ValveIndex,im not going to pay more than $600 for it...
ValveIndex,"judging by the languages on the guide book it seems that they are going to sell it in more countries this time,one of the surprises is that it includes arabic instructions which is good news for us in the middle east!"
oculus,You are welcome man! As a non rift owner waiting for the rift s too to become in stock i understand your confusion =D.
oculus,"Its about 400 usd which is about the same as the original rift ,so i imagine it would be the same price in australia too?"
oculus,"the oculus rift is out of stock everywhere since they announced its follower 

the rift s

https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/?locale=en_US

if you can wait for 5 more days you will probably be able to get the newer version!"
ValveIndex,"They cost a lot of money but most importantly,returns and replacements would be hell =("
ValveIndex,i would be furious if that is the case
starcitizen,"You just sold me in the game,i very much value the feelings of relaxation in games,just one question tho,is it viable for solo players?"
AskReddit,"I took the exam yesterday and just got the results,i just wanted to tell you that i did pass physics! No more physics for me forever again!

Thanks for your encouraging words!"
oculus,htc wont have a vr future if they keep pricing their headsets like this
oculus,"Nope,saudi arabia my friend!"
oculus,I dont know but i feel like the old controller is more comfortable...
3DS,Canada and the us only =(
oculus,"I hope not,as oculus does not ship to my country whoch means i have to rely on retail (mainly amazon)"
oculus,"I think the launch date is just a placeholder,but it technically confirms it will release in may"
GameDeals,"I remember playing this game after my last exam in high school for 12 hours straight,i love this game!"
AskReddit,did i pass physics?

Thanks!"
oculus,"I will keep that in mind! Lets hope valve actually sells the index on amazon as its the only e trailer that i trust that ships to my country!(and also hope that the specs will be great,and the price....)."
oculus,"I move a lot so unfortunately the index isnt for me as it would force me to install the lighthouses everytime i move into a new house,the rift s would be way more convenient."
oculus,Looks like My non vr days will be over soon...
iosgaming,When will the first one go on sale? Im waiting for it to buy it!
oculus,"But it doesnt answer the most important question,when does it release? =("
humblebundles,THATS AWESOME!i just hope they dont cheap out on regular unlocks
oculus,Rumors suggest that the rifts will release on may 1st and it has been confirmed that the pre orders of the index will start on may 1st so i would suggest you to wait to see the specs of the index and its price
oculus,"The problem with cities skylines is that the performance is terrible,which is unfortunate since i love the game SO much but getting 40 fps on a rtx 2080 when the city isnt even at 10k is just shitty optimization "
oculus,"Man,whats you job!"
GameDeals,opinions on the $15 bundle if i dont have any of the games?
oculus,Based on the steam page it seems that the headset ships on june 15th
oculus,you can check your ipd in decent accuracy by using any app that measures using the front camera on your phone
nvidia,thats actually hilarious 
oculus,"i have a question but it may be a bit off topic,does valve sell their hardware on amazon? because that would be the only place i can get the index from since my country isnt officially supported by valve..."
Steam,"My guess is $800,but i will just buy a rift s if its really priced at $800,im just waiting and hoping it would be $600 at most"
oculus,"please be comfortable when using glasses, please be comfortable when using glasses....."
GameDeals,"I want to know if this is the case or not,since my best friend lives in another country"

Edit: looks like sean just confirmed the pc version on twitter

oculus,"when you ship internationally from amazon they remove the origin country's vat then apply your country's vats,so the price would be 333 gbp without vats then they add the shipping +26gbp then they add your country,s vat which comes around to be 457 gbp"

Anyways,thanks for the suggestion!"
fireemblem,Fe6!
fireemblem,"Thanks for the suggestions!

As for your question:its really hard for me to answer since i liked all of them and what makes the question even harder is that most of the characters died early on so i didnt have much time with them i think the only character that stayed with me from the early game was marcus,seriously,that guy was built like a tank.

However, my favorite character gameplay wise has to be pent (im one of these people that always choose to be a mage in rpgs so yeah,that explains my choice i guess...) 

But my favorite overall character is elliwood,even tho i didnt use him much during gameplay but the dialogues made me like him since his personality reminds me of mine (except the “being brave” part...)"
fireemblem,"I will,this community seems like one of the best communities out there for any game series so I won’t hesitate to ask any questions!"

I even tried turning off gamemode by script/turning off pagefile,setting it to custom amount/overclocking/downclocking,literally everything that could impact games’ performance

That is why im so sure its a software issue either from nvidia’s side or microsofts"
nvidia,"Im sure i didnt,i changed my cpu 3 times, changed my gpu 7 times and built a second pc just to get rid of the stuttering,downgraded to every possible windows 10 iteration,updated to the latest iterations and even tried insider builds

But none of these helped,i spent nearly $3000 and countless hours of trial and error and searching the internet to fix this issue but it wasnt fixed.microsoft has to stop messing around with gaming since its doing nobody good."

When the game was released on epic store i was pleasantly surprised to see that the price of the game is only $20 in my country,im sure steam is better in having more features but im in now way paying 60 more dollars just for the sake of “boycotting epic store”

So i jumped on it and bought it on epic store.."
