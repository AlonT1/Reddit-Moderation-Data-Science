He could start the came for all I care "

It would be a save situation if he finished it out "
WahoosTipi,"Miller has like 8 more innings pitched so far they said. 
So in general trying to even those out over time now, not just short term "

WahoosTipi,Hardest thrown assist in all of baseball this season surpassing Bryce Harper at 99 mph
WahoosTipi,I swear Bauer could throw a complete game shut out and be pissed at himself for throwing a few balls 
WahoosTipi,"I love his fire but I think pitchers have figured him out. It was similar to Naquin but it took a bit longer. 

Its possible, I just think his short success was due to major league pitchers not having a scouting report on him to shut him down "
WahoosTipi,The Robertson ground out is staring to get cliche :(

WahoosTipi,If you watch the play you can tell he just scraped his hand when he went for the slide. But even still I just want to wrap him in bubble wrap and have him play that way.
WahoosTipi,It said yan gomes home run on the TV graphic 
WahoosTipi,Well can't say that Michael Martinez is gone considering we got him back after a brief vacation in Boston last year as well. 
WahoosTipi,Why is he so fucking adorable?
WahoosTipi,Clevinger looked great. His walks looked much more like he  was just off rather than being wild like he would get last season. Hopefully he only continues to improve 
WahoosTipi,It's not a clevinger start if he doesn't walk at least 3 people

WahoosTipi,"LOOK AT THAT RAIN!

You know we should definitely delay the game again. Yep for sure lets delay indefinitely RIGHT NOW before we get THREE OUTS..."
WahoosTipi,"He's always been good at getting a lot of pitches out of pitchers. 

His problem is that's due to his ability to foul off a bunch, he just doesn't take pitches once he gets in that situation. 

If he gets better at not swinging at EVERYTHING and having long tedious at bats, it'll be much more productive and he'll walk a lot more. "
news,"A type of elbow tendon surgery which was popularized when first done on a pitcher named Tommy John that made a common pitcher injury that would force them to retire able to pitch for much longer. 

Its a very common surgery for pitchers these days "
WahoosTipi,"AYYYY at the very least we get to see Plutko get a shot. 

That makes light of an otherwise shitty game."
WahoosTipi,"Hopefully tito told them not to after last inning that was certainly the opposite of what we wanted 

Edit: and then Napoli pops out on the first pitch... "
WahoosTipi,"Remember: we always fuck Chicago's bullpen. 

Just need to wait the count and get Quintana out then we'll have better chances against their lackluster bullpen "
WahoosTipi,His 40 would be so long if it was on YouTube it would have a commercial halfway through 
WahoosTipi,"He's got much too big of a hole in his zone right now. 
He needs to hit better against lefties and not constantly swing at high fastballs. 

All of his great home runs and power were because people kept trying to bury breaking stuff low and he feasted until they figured it out. 

If he can't adjust, he'll falter. He needs to show he can adjust either this season or spring training next season "
WahoosTipi,"There's been numerous analysis articles that talked about Naquin's inability to hit high pitches and his strength in hitting those much lower than you would anticipate possible. Even when he was playing really well people were saying it was just a matter of time before he started slumping once pitchers and their scouts learned how to approach him. 



It's just going to depend on how Naquin adjusts. If he doesn't learn how to hit the high heat or lay off and not swing at those up and out of the zone, he might not be that successful ever again in the majors. "
WahoosTipi,FUCK

WahoosTipi,"Napoli and Rajai have been great, and everything that I hear about Uribe in the locker room shows that he provided a lot more off the field despite faltering a bit on it. 

They're definitely doing a good job helping soften the blow of not having Brantley most of the year."
WahoosTipi,"The problem was the call at first was out, so they had to find something definitive for him to be safe. 

It's kind of shitty, but it's how the rule goes. Unless it's very obvious he was safe, they can't call him safe since the call on the field was out."
WahoosTipi,"He has twice as many at bats vs righties than lefties since he was used much more often when he was a Ray. The idea when we got him was to exclusively use him against lefties since we have Naquin as a lefty and Chisenhall. 

He has the same amount of RBIs, similar doubles and a few less homers against righties, but his OPS against righties is only .616 vs a 1.127 OPS vs lefties. 

There's definitely a difference. I don't think he's a .360 hitter against lefties (small sample) but it's pretty clear there's a huge difference. 

I'm not the best statistical analyzer, hopefully someone like /u/thedeejus can provide a better insight as to the difference when he's not busy. "

OOTP,"Yeah that's what seems to be coming to light. There's so much that matches but some strange things that don't, like him being a switch hitter. I just find it strange that the real A-Rod is now just gone, and this eerily similar player just happens to show up when he disappeared. 

"
OOTP,"Very interesting. That seems to make sense. 
He's just got a lot of other things that match, like the same number (#13) the same position (3B) and stats and power numbers. It's as if they just generated a younger version of him that can switch hit. 

The problem is I can't find the real A-Rod anywhere in the game either, and there was no news notes about him retiring. I could have missed that though. 

So strange. It's like he was cloned. "
OOTP,Absolutely nothing prior to this year. 
OOTP,"Nope it's definitely him. I could see all his career stats and when I signed his contract in free agency, his nickname was still ""A-Rod"". But as soon as spring training started, all his previous stats disappeared and other things changed. 


"
OOTP,"I have no idea. 
It's the real A-Rod, I picked him up from free agency after his contract ran out. He had his previous stats from his lengthy career. Then when the season started, his age decreased and his nickname went from ""A-Rod"" to ""Snacks"". I didn't realize something fucked up until he won rookie of the month and knew something was screwy. 

edit: Also apparently he learned how to switch hit? I have no idea what happened."
WahoosTipi,Absolutely Lindorable. Thanks for sharing!

baseball,"A lot of it can be once you get in a slump, you start overthinking things. You're trying so hard to find out what's causing you to preform poorly that you start developing bad habits in an attempt to fix your problem that only makes you less comfortable and perform worse. 

A lot of the times people that get out of slumps talk about how they were overthinking every time they went up to the plate in an attempt to get out of their slump, but in reality the effort was just digging them deeper. 

Sometimes it can be a player was preforming well but had an exploitable weakness that pitchers picked up on, and once they figured the batter out, they started ""slumping"" but it was actually more to what their true performance would be. 

An example would be on the Indians Tyler Naquin. He's their rookie center fielder, and he's been raking. If you look, a lot of his hard hit balls and home runs are low off-speed pitches, which is a common strikeout or out-getting pitch with 2 strikes. For Tyler though that's his happy zone, and crushes those. When you see pitchers pitch him high heat though, he struggles and can strike out much easier that way. Once pitchers across the league all start trying that, I would expect him to have much less success than he's having right now. "

MLBTheShow,"There's a function that I didn't know about and I don't actually think has an animation, but if you hold the lead button (R1) but don't let go to take a lead, you lean and have much higher percentages at stealing bases, even with people that only have 60 or so stealing or speed. The only caveat to that though, is if they try and throw to pick you off (which isn't very often since you haven't actually taken a lead) you 100% get in a pickle. But it's easy to not get caught since you just go back to first right before they throw and you're safe most of the time. 

I've been doing that and not taking any lead and I steal more than 80% of my bases with mid to fast players. "

MLBTheShow,"Franchise has always been my favorite mode and the reason why I get  MLB The Show. You can really control as much or as little of the franchise process as you want. If you don't want to control lineups or call ups and call downs, you can have the computer do that for you. Or if you're like me, you can micro manage everything and turn a team into your own project. 

Trading and getting players you like from other teams onto your favorite team is always fun, for example I traded to get Kris Bryant as my third basemen on the indians. 

As for tutorials, you can really learn slowly by yourself by just having the computer control everything you're not sure how to do, and then turning off the AI control when you want to fiddle around with it. Like learning when to call people up and put people on the DL, once you see how the computer starts moving them around, you can start learning the trends and do it yourself.

AskReddit,"Cumulative GPA does indeed suck, good luck to you as well! Good luck to you, I'm sure you'll do it right this time"
AskReddit,"You have so much time to succeed, don't let your fears of the future inhibit your fun and experimentation of the present. Use your time to practice, but never forget that you're supposed to be having fun and that's what matters. You're allowed to stop and smell the roses, and put your nose to the grindstone later, when it counts. "
AskReddit,You could have mine if you like. You'd just have to figure out how to get it to start...
AskReddit,"It won't be long until someone comes around that wishes to spend their life with you. If you love your life and yourself, someone is bound to feel the same way as well. "
AskReddit,"I went through the very same not too long ago. I lost a significant amount of weight (while being underweight normally) causing me to get sick frequently and sleep too frequently. It's not easy, but it gets better, and there are those that can help you through it. "
AskReddit,Shitty ping and smoggy skies are circumstances I wouldn't wish on the worst of my enemies. 
AskReddit,"I believe in you, jonesmcbones. What exactly are you doing with your life? "
AskReddit,You and me both friend. The least I can offer you is that you're not alone. 
AskReddit,"How trivial, exactly?"
AskReddit,"Congrats! Stick with it, you'll be so happy you did. That's not easy to accomplish in the slightest "
AskReddit,"Are you me? Sounds like my exact situation. 
I'm currently repairing my GPA in community college as we speak, and honestly is so much better than where I was. I wasn't happy there and hopefully I will be wherever I end up transferring to. 
It sucks, it really does. But it's not over, and you have plenty of time to fix it and continue with your future. "
AskReddit,"I'm in the same boat, it's hard realizing that. The best thing we can do is take a step forward and make an effort, no matter how small, and try our best to make new friends. You're not alone, I feel just as you do. Making friends is not easy and society makes it seem like it just happens"
AskReddit,"You have plenty of time, don't worry about settling down. You are awesome and following urges is what being young is all about. "
AskReddit,"Cherish every moment you have, make her know that she is loved and that her life was one that was worth living. 

My sympathies, I hope you and your family the best. "
AskReddit,"That's truly horrible. I can't even imagine. 
Not everyone is like that, I assure you. Though many don't understand what it's like, those that can learn to understand will try everything in their power to help. Often it's just getting them to understand that's the hard part. "
AskReddit,"It's the least I could do! Thank you for sharing, it's difficult to explain what you're going through"
AskReddit,"That's fantastic. Maybe this story will give those hope that figured all was bleak in their future, that anything is possible. "
AskReddit,"That's incredibly grueling. That kind of discipline to keep that going is astonishing. Good luck and godspeed, I hope you find at least a little time for yourself"
AskReddit,"At the very least you aren't alone. No matter what the struggles, having someone to tough it out with you surely makes it at least somewhat more tolerable. 
My sympathies. I hope you might find easier times in the future, if even just a little. "
