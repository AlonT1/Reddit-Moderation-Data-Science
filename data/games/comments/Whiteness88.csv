PS4,It's a good game but it didn't click with me like HR did. I genuinely loved it and consider it one of the best games of that gen but I couldn't find that feeling with this one. I think I got 3/4 of the way before I stopped.
SquaredCircle,"I think so, I don't think it's bad but it's certainly been underwhelming. I find it hard to keep interest for now.

I've always maintained that defending both titles at the same time was not a good idea. This pretty much robs the IC title of it's meaning and prestige, it really was just a *slight* hair below the HW title and it felt really special and important. Now it's just a title that's defended alongside the HW championship."
nba,But didn't the Spurs end up being *right*?
nba,He cut his hair? He had some very long hair the last time I saw him.
nba,"Last *two* plays. Shit still pisses me off, that said everything about Kyrie."
nba,Nuggets in the 80's and early 90's had an absurd pace. Quite a few team scoring records were achieved playing against them and opposing players had some insane stats. Guess who Scott Skiles played against when he had 30 assists?
nba,Imagine being an opposing player and seeing this fucking mountain of a man just casually running a fastbreak towards you. I'd be crying in relief after he passed the ball to Kobe.
nba,I envy how he looks so fucking *cool* in this clip.
nba,"> It's part of why I respect Curry so much. Sure, sometimes he does his version of ISO by chucking a 35 footer, but for the most part he respects the system, plays within it.

Steph's always been a team player and it's common to see him being among the most hyped whenever a teammate gets hot (watch Klay's explosions, Steph never stops laughing) but it's also probably because Steph's always getting dogged by somebody and he knows he'd probably die if he played that way. No player has gravity even remotely close as he does."
nba,"Yeah, I listen him more for his insight about being in the NBA. I think he's cool for that."
nba,"Double teaming was allowed but you had to fully commit to it, you just couldn't roam near another player like players do today."
nba,"Bol never had that imposing and intimidating presence that other people his height did, similar to Shawn Bradley who I specifically mentioned because he was 7'6'' but his size never impacted me much because he was skinny. Eaton and Boban, despite ""only"" being 7'4'', feel bigger when you see them on the court because they were also massive.

Bol amazed just because of how long and how....*weird* he looked. He was all limbs; he had an 8'6'' wingspan!"
nba,"Nailed it. I found it weird how the OP called out BB since they're not an official entity and don't ""award"" anything, they just follow what the NBA itself established."
nba,MTV was so much fun in the 90s.
dragonball,"> I don't recall if there was a situation where someone sensed another's ki and it felt like a ton of pressure

Trunks did when Vegeta showed SSB to him."
nba,"It's always funny when you see legit 7'4'' or above dudes playing next other players. Not just tall guys but guys who had meat in their bones since Shawn Bradley never quite looked that intimidating. People like Boban, Mark Eaton and Yao just look comically huge in a league full of huge guys.

It's even more amazing when a big guy like Yao did stuff like this. Man, he was such a skilled big."
nba,"It's really something. Anyone else besides Dame and Curry does this and we're all like WTF but LeBron does it and it's like, ""Yeah, fair enough."""
dragonball,"I hadn't noticed the user mentioned the anime and not the manga but yes, this is only a thing in the manga. The anime doesn't present any drawbacks to Blue."
dragonball,"You're possibly referring to Vegeta only being able to use 10% of it's power against Hit because he demonstrated it to Cabba. This only happened in the manga, not the anime. I don't remember if it was specifically Whis but it was mentioned that repeated use of it in short succession would weaken it's power."
dragonball,"> SSB has a huge stamina drain

That's only a thing in the manga, where the strain is shown to be similar to SSJ3. In the anime, we only get mentions by Goku and Whis that Blue drains stamina. We don't know how significant it is but it seems like it's only significant for something like the TOP, which is an extended battle with multiple opponents, because we've never actually seen Blue's stamina issues affect Goku and Vegeta. 

This is in contrast with SSJ3, Goku has issues with it the instant he first uses it against Majin Buu and again with Kid Buu. Gotenks also has issues in that it severely diminishes his fusion time.

Going back to Blue's stamina issues in the manga: it seems like it's no longer a significant issue after the Black Arc. Heck, Vegeta uses SSBE without any issues whatosever."
nba,"Even back then there were height shenanigans. The guy in the middle was announced as 6'2"" and the guy to his left at 6'3""?"
dragonball,"The latter. It's also Goku acknowleding Broly as a fellow Saiyan since only Vegeta, Nappa and Radditz have called him that. By telling Broly to use his Saiyan name, he's telling him he's legit and honestly wants to keep sparing with him."
nba,"Wow, these are very clean and beautiful. The Vice jersey will forever be the king but these ones are right there in the Top 2-5 spot."
nba,"That's sneakily one of the more underrated arguments for Jordan's GOAT status. Despite playing in an era where advanced stats only started becoming a thing in niche circles during the end of his career, Jordan played in such a dominating way that no matter what advanced stat you throw at him, he almost always comes out at the top. He's usually the only ""old"" player who pops up with Shaq, Barkley and David Robinson sometimes making cameos."
nba,"> It's crazy how Vogel was what? There second or third choice but ended up being the best coach for the job.

What really stuck with me was how Dudley mentioned how even LeBron was very impressed with the scouting job Vogel and the staff did for a playoff game. LeBron's seen it all so in order to impress him, you know it had to have been one hell of a scouting job.

And this is something even a casual observer could tell. Vogel made changes even when they were up in series. They were very prepared, even for how teams would respond to their previously used schemes."
nba,"That's true but I think in retrospect, those Heat teams weren't as dominant as everyone thought they'd be. That helped LeBron's case...that and him just being as awesome as he was. His first MVP season there he was fantastic but his 12-13 season is still a Top 5 season ever.

IMO, a better example of what you said would be Durant in GS."
nba,"I'll always feel people let Kawhi off too lightly just because he's so quiet. His camp started talking shit about the Spurs, saying they didn't value his health. The fucking SPURS!"
nba,It's amazing looking at LeBron work and destroy dudes in the post when he had an extremely rudimentary and limited post game a decade before.
nba,That was two seasons afterwards.
nba,"It's crazy to think that LeBron's going to be paid that much at that age and everyone's pretty much like, ""Yeah, that's great for the Lakers.""

And it's the right move! I can see Bron still averaging something like 22/7/9 at age 39."
nba,....but I mentioned Wallace ヽ( `д´*)ノ
nba,"> His body caught up with him in that season

At age 40...during his 19th season. That just blows my mind. Considering his high level of play, how physical he was and how his career low in games played prior to that Lakers season was *80*, Malone might've been the most durable player in NBA history although LeBron might end up being more impressive due to his deep playoff runs."
nba,"At first glance it is but his prime coincided with Wallace, Garnett and Mutombo. All three players had convincing arguments. I do think Camby winning it in 07 was crap and Duncan should've gotten it that year."
SquaredCircle,I'll never know how Nash and Hall didn't burst out laughing at the sheer absurdity of this. This is hilarious!
nba,"I wish Boban had better stamina and a bit more mobility. Dude has tons of skill, he's not just some big stiff. It's just fun seeing him absolutely destroy other dudes in the time he plays. It's funny seeing bigs between 6'10"" and 7'1'' look small next to him."
Games,"I fully agree but it just wasn't a good MGS game, IMO. It lacked pretty much everything that I loved about MGS, especially the story. I only got around halfway when I stopped playing it since a big reason I dig MGS is because of the lore and since the game's plot is mostly inconsequential to the MG saga as a whole, I just couldn't find myself interested in playing it more."
Games,"Mostly because it's not a port, it's the PS2 version running on PS4. That means you'll see tons of frame rate drops and screen tearing."
dragonball,"Just wanted to add that even as it is, Piccolo's surprisingly not fallen *that* far behind considering he doesn't have access to higher forms or biomechanical upgrades, like the androids, that help him achieve higher powers. He's sneakily the character who gets the most off-screen power boosts. He's kept up somewhat just by training consistently. At the moment, I think he's passed by 17 and is only somewhat behind Gohan in terms of power. That's impressive as hell."
nba,"For some reason, I thought Kareem was 35 and a few months younger than LeBron was just now. I'll correct it, thanks for pointing it out."
nba,"After reading the title, I honestly thought Adams was going to kick Draymond in the balls."
nba,I knew that one of them was credited to Robinson and both got a hand on the shot but Robinson looked like he got there first. The article says it was Duncan but I remember seeing another video with another angle that showed Robinson got it.
nba,"Yeah, I felt I was going insane last off-season. Until LeBron fails to live up to his usual standards, he's still the best and it's not even really close. The media was going crazy over Kawhi's playoff run with the Raptors but they seemed to forget LeBron had what is quite possibly the GOAT playoff run the year prior. Seeing so many people crown Kawhi after just one run made me think I was losing my mind. 

I heard that LeBron's injury and age caused some to lose faith in him but like I said, I only believe it when I see it. LeBron's been consistently upping his game during the playoffs after chilling during the regular season. He just became the second oldest Finals MVP in history....at age 35.

Edit: He's the second oldest Finals MVP."
nba,That's always been the argument for Hakeem's claim among the best. Everybody gives Portland shit but I've never heard anybody give Houston shit for taking Olajuwon.
nba,"I remember the first time that I saw this dunk; I didn't think it was anything special. But the more I looked at it, my eyes slowly started widening until I finished processing and realized what Chambers did. Absolutely disgusting dunk."
todayilearned,"Wish I had known that before I created my name.... made it 12 years ago for PSN and it was joke at my own expense due to me being so white despite living in the tropics. The 88's just my birthyear. 


So....I accidentally made the most neonazi name in history."
SquaredCircle,I still can't grasp how planned it seemed. It's one of those botches that actually worked beautifully for the moment and made that rumble more memorable.
nba,"To further put this into context, *Charlotte* has made the playoffs 3 times in that span."
dataisbeautiful,"Yeah, that's one those things that Neil DeGrasse Tyson mentioned in his podcast and I stopped what I was doing because it blew my mind."
TropicalWeather,"Katrina, Maria, Harvey and Sandy are pretty much a lock to be included. My number 5 would be Wilma over Dorian due to how utterly insane it was."
nba,Marc has a big (literal) advantage: he's still a fucking giant. He doesn't need to be as mobile as Howard or McGee to be an effective inside presence due to his high BBIQ.
dragonball,"It started off well but I admit Moro annoyed me because he had more ass pulls than even Buu did but I will give him credit for being a unique villain in both design and abilities. The arc would've been right up there with the best had it ended better, I can't get over Goku being such a moron and giving Moro a Senzu."
dragonball,"Jiren utterly destroys Merged Zamasu. In the anime, Goku would've *killed* Merged Zamasu with his Kamehameha if it weren't for his immortality. In the manga, Goku was able to fight on par with him using Perfected SSB, something that didn't make Jiren even sweat."
dragonball,Beerus says so after the gang comes back after Zeno erased the Zamasus.
dragonball,"Broly's a bonafide stud but what Uub did in the last chapter just floored me. For someone to leave Vegeta shocked like that, you know they're packing some serious power. Uub has that much power without barely any training."
nba,"Teams do the measuring, not the NBA. The NBA simply required them to list their heights barefoot instead of with shoes. It's not perfect, mind you, since Serge Ibaka is listed at 7'0'' and Marc Gasol's 6'11''. That's simply not possible since Gasol noticeably towers over Ibaka.

Both KD and Boogie are listed at 6'10'' but it's possible Boogie's 6'9.5'' and KD's 6'10.25''. That may explain KD looking a bit taller since both those numbers round up to 6'10''."
dragonball,"The manga's never said anything about Goku only being able to use it once, only that he had an incomplete version of it due to him simply mimicking Beerus' Hakai when he tried using it against Fused Zamasu. He *was* doing the technique but it was just too slow for it to effective against Zamasu (who we later find out cannot be killed by it, anyways).

He does seem to have it mastered it now, at least he performed a similar technique when he turned a boulder that was on top of Moro into ash. He didn't say the name but the hand movement and effect are pretty much in line with how the Hakai works.

What we don't know for certain is whether Goku can use it at will or if it's only accessible to him when he's using a form that uses God Ki like Perfect SSB and UI."
nba,"I wish him the best and I really hope he's solved his injury issues. While I don't expect him to drop 29 ppg on fantastic efficiency again, it'd be nice for him to at least be a spark off the bench. That 2016-2017 season was so much fun, seeing this ""little"" guy (he's average IRL) just drop 40 on dudes a foot taller than him never got old. The timing of his injury fucking sucked, it costed him millions."
nba,"> I think KD said he lied about his height coming into the league because he didn't want to play PF/C. I remember his listed height was 6'9"", which was bullshit.

Teams do their own measuring so it's not like KD could get away with that. KD's issue was that his listed height was closer to his actual height compared to everyone else, who had an inch or two added to their listed height. That made Durant seemed taller than he is."
SquaredCircle,"I loved Austin and Rock's rivalry. They didn't hate each other per se, they were just trying to one up each other. Austin stunning HHH probably got Rock madder than anything else Austin could've done, including stunning *him*."
dragonball,"Don't think so, anything he knew about the gang came from Gero's research."
nba,"> holds Hakeem, Shaq, KG, Russell and Duncan as better players than Bird and Magic all time.

He doesn't, I think you're misunderstanding his top 40 list. He wasn't listing the best players of all time, he was listing the most valuable careers which also takes into consideration longevity. Bird and Magic had relatively short careers compared to other greats due to injuries (Bird) or HIV (Magic). 

This is the same reason why he has Jordan ""behind"" LeBron or Kareem: he doesn't actually think they're better than Jordan. Hearing him talk about in his podcasts, I think it's clear he thinks Jordan's the best ever but the fact is Jordan had longevity issues due to his retirements affecting how impactful his overall career is compared to LeBron and Kareem, who are arguably the superstars in league history who've had the longest periods of sustained excellence and value to their teams."
nba,"Been waiting for this ever since it was announced. Really excited about this since Ben Taylor's the best person I've seen that combines both statistical analysis with what the film shows or the ""eye test"". 

He really opened my eyes about Reggie Miller's value and made me feel like a dumbass for not realizing how ahead of his time he was. I always thought Miller was overrated due to his somewhat underwhelming counting stats, not realizing how much his game helped his team and how big of a jump he took during the playoffs.

He's one of the few people I've seen that will consistently back up his claims despite it being counter to the usual thinking. For example, he doesn't think Stockton's as good of a passer as his insane assists average would suggest and he backs it up with convincing arguments."
SquaredCircle,"Holy shit, you hit the nail right on the head! Even as a kid, I always thought Walter Mercado looked odd."
dragonball,"This is my assessment. Piccolo is sneakily the fighter that gets the most random powerboosts in the story and arguably the hardest one to gauge since his power seems to be the most plot dependent. At the moment, it seems he's only a notch below Gohan, who's gotten considerably stronger since the ToP."
apple,"Been a user of Apollo since it was released, thank you for your continued development. That being said, here's hoping I can get my mom a Mini!"
nba,How the fuck?
nba,"It's unreal how legit skilled he is. Usually, players that tall are mostly big stiffs but Boban's an actual basketball player who's held back by the same thing that benefits him: his giant body. He simply can't keep up with today's pace and it's a shame as he's shown he's not just a meme."
SquaredCircle,"> Yes, plus the fact that she makes others look like million bucks in the ring.

Didn't Scott Hall once say that you should never let anyone know you're great seller because you run the risk of being used for others?"
SquaredCircle,Legit question: is that comparable? WWE's audience has noticeably shrunk these past few years.
nba,"Yeah, I get that alot. I'm Puerto Rican and I made this name for PSN back in '08. It wasn't until I got here that people pointed out how....weird it was."
nba,"He played both, he was versatile enough for it. IIRC, Simons mentioned that he also played the 2 on ocassion. I think he was still considered an SF during that time, though."
nba,"That badass woman and her org fucking flipped Georgia out of sheer will and determination. I don't idolize people, I've never liked it, but I think I'll end up crying if I ever meet her due to the immense gratitude and admiration I feel for what she helped achieve."
SquaredCircle,"Even as a kid who believed in kayfabe, Benoit being there made me go like, ""Oh cool, I guess that's a thing"" instead of a bigger reaction.

WCW really was in the shitter back then. So much so that Bret winning the title was ""meh"". And then you had people like Jarrett winning it multiple times!"
nba,"He's pretty properly rated, usually in the Top 15-20 although he may have fallen of to Top 25 now. Chuck may be underrated by the younger generation who mostly know him for Inside the NBA but he's always been given his due."
politics,"Give it a few more years, I think historians are reluctant to properly rank current presidents since they're still not done with their term. That being said, he's already the worst in one of those surveys so that says alot."
nba,"You know, I read ""water cannon"" but I was expecting something like one those fire hoses that firemen use but bigger, I wasn't expecting an actual fucking water *cannon*."
nba,Simmons has said he has him at 2.
dragonball,"Then Xeno would erase Beerus since he'd point out this happened on his watch and thus, not doing his duty. Pretty sure Beerus would prefer to minimize his interactions with Xeno."
nba,"Because, IIRC, he actually was there but just not in that pic."
nba,People talk about the Varejao dunk but this one beats it for me. It's just so beautiful yet vicious.
nba,"I was thinking about this the other day, out of the blue. I think Dirk's the player that I've seen swish more shots than anyone else."
nba,"That's one of those Wilt myths that's just outside of being believable along with him breaking someone toe with a dunk. 

I don't think people realize what a 48 inch vert is. A 48 inch vert on a 7'1'' dude would mean he would clear his entire head above the rim. From the film I've seen, he gets pretty high but nothing I haven't seen DeAndre and Dwight do during their primes. He's an insane athlete but he does have some supposed feats that, for some reason, there's no footage or proof off besides word of mouth."
nba,"We talk about how bad the 2018 due to how recent it was but that 2007 team...ugh, they may hay a case for the worst supporting squad for a Finals team ever."
nba,"Definitely, he's arguably the best defender the game has ever seen. It's rare for such an offensively limited player to have such a big impact on the game just with his defense. Only Russell impacted more on that end.

What hurts Wallace, other than his non-existent offensive skills, is his short peak. He was a late bloomer and since he was undersized, once he started declining athletically, the drop off was pretty big."
nba,"I argue it wouldn't have made much difference since Shaq was just too fucking large. There's only so much taking care of your body can do when you weight 330+ pounds. He could've lost weight but that'd be robbing him of his biggest advantage. There's also the fact that I don't believe Shaq really loved the game after getting hacked so often. When the best defense a dude can play on you is continuously smacking you on your arm, it's stop being fun for a while. Shaq didn't look like it since he was so strong and imposing but he was constantly having nagging injuries because of that.

When he sat down with Kobe, he actually alluded to this. Kobe mentioned how Shaq drove him crazy with his lazy offseason and Shaq replied, while laughing, ""Man, I'm not gonna focus on that during the summer. I was tired and beat up!""

That being said, Shaq had surprising longevity for someone his size."
nba,"Bingo! Was about to say this. 

Drawing fouls doesn't seem to be talked about much when it comes to scoring. It's the easiest and most efficient shot in basketball and if you don't draw enough fouls, it can really put a cap on your scoring. It's a big reason why Reggie Miller upped his scoring in the playoffs and what separates him from other shooters."
nba,"Plus, if you have guys like that having your back, it's because they respect the hell out of you."
nba,"I mostly remember just being so happy he was able to play for so long, he really struggled with foot injuries at the beginning of his career and it seemed like he was gonna have to retire early.

He also wasn't just some big stiff, dude had legit skills."
nba,"> He posted something on Twitter that said ""Hitler was right"" and it wasn't even an actually quote from Hitler. It was just some anti-semitic bs.

That was some NFL layer, Jackson came out in support of him and his statement."
nba,"I'm sorry, are you going off at me? I wasn't saying LeBron isn't clutch, I commented in another response that LeBron himself has proven he's clutch as hell. I'm merely explaining why this particular shot is underrated despite it also being a very clutch shot."
nba,"> If two players achieved similar levels of dominance but one did it with rules being changed to prevent his dominance then its a legitimate argument that he's the better of the two.

I disagree with that assertion and I also don't think it's something that's considered or even fair. Wilt lived in an era where the game was still new and growing, thus there was more constant change. Jordan didn't have a chance to impact the game in a way that rules were changed because the game was more mature when he played."
nba,"And I'm not saying anyone is using it, I'm merely saying I disagree with Wilt's reasoning."
nba,The game that forced me to like LeBron. I used to think he was overrated up until this point.
nba,"Definitely, it wasn't a knock against Mikan *but* there's no legit argument for Mikan being above either MJ despite him having moves changed because of him. Who's to say rules wouldn't be changed for Jordan had he been playing in the 60's and been flying all over the place?"
nba,I thought 2015-2016 was a decent year for the East. At least you didn't have utter crap teams in the playoffs.
nba,"They're very entertaining, at least and at Simmons is one of the best historians out there and he can tie current things with previous stuff better than anyone.

I think a problem for them is that they have to fill so many hours and create so much content that they end up spitting out hot takes just to have something to talk about."
nba,"I've never liked that reasoning because it also applies to someone like George Mikan, who had rules changed because of how he played."
nba,It's so weird how I now don't cringe whenever Rondo takes a jump shot. He was legit dependable in the playoffs and probably the Lakers third most important player. It's the first time that I can recall that a bench player from a LeBron-led team was actually able to run the offense and give Bron some room to breath.
nba,He looked good for a couple of games and then his body just completely gave out.
nba,"> Ray Allen's shot was arguably the most clutch shot in NBA History though, why does that have to be the bar?

The Bron hate is real but it's 2020 and that narrative has pretty much been killed by Bron himself. Even if Bron hadn't been fighting that narrative at the time, that shot would still be overshadowed by Allen's shot because that's the game everyone remembers the most from that series. I also mentioned how there were still 28 seconds left so there was still a game left to finish in a two-posession game. Again, it's because of those two factors that this shot isn't talked about as much."
nba,"Yeah, that's something I still don't understand."
nba,"It's a really clutch shot but it just can't compared to Allen's shot in Game 6, probably *the* clutchest shot in NBA history.

There's also the fact that 28 seconds remained so there was still time left. This made it so the shot was less ""dramatic"" even though it ended up pretty much sealing the deal."
dragonball,"Gogeta's on a whole other level. *Base* Gogeta was stronger than both Goku and Vegeta in Blue. He probably could've beaten LSSJ Broly with just his SSJ form as Broly only landed one hit on him but Gogeta wasn't fucking around and wanted to end it ASAP.

Broly and Jiren would've probably done equally as well (if Jiren can unleash his potential at will) although due to Broly's rage and reckless fighting style, he's arguably more dangerous."
nba,"Arguably the best defender of all time. Even more amazing when you consider how undersized he was at the time. He was listed at 6'9'' but it's generally accepted he was an inch or two shorter. This isn't like Draymond playing the 5 for 10 minutes, dude was a full time Center yet he was outrebounding players half a foot taller than him."
nba,"That's arguably the best example due to the LeBron Effect. 4 years of crapiness immediately after he leaves, 4 years of contending immediately after he returns and now, immediately after he leaves *again* who knows how long it'll take to get back."
SquaredCircle,"It's the same brand I use, I really like it."
SquaredCircle,"2000 is arguably the best year WWF/E ever had. They managed to perfectly blend great characters with good matches on a consistent basis. WWF had never produced better wrestling matches than WCW until that year. Granted, it also helped that WCW was just utter shit during that year."
SquaredCircle,2000 HHH was one of the greatest heels *ever*. Just phenomenal work all around.
TropicalWeather,Such a fascinating storm although I still wonder if other storms weren't just as strong. I know there's been rumblings that Haiyan was much stronger than it was assessed.
nba,Yeo! That's the one.
SquaredCircle,"The old Smackdown! games in the PS1 used to have flashbulbs going off when you did a wrestler's finisher. 12 year old me got so hyped because of that. Those things added so much to the overall atmosphere, it really felt bigger than life."
nba,I’ve seen footage of Moses and he was just relentless. I got exhausted just even looking at it.
nba,"I know Olajuwon, Eaton and Sampson did. Wilt did block the shot twice in a row although the second one seemed like a goalted."
nba,*passive aggressively glares at Peter*
nba,"While I think his 2009 run was even better, that run was just so much fun. His series against Toronto was just a hilarious showing of dominance."
SquaredCircle,"That's pretty much the majority of title runs nowadays, unfortunately. It's never been about quantity, it's about quality. AJ's first WWE run was shorter than his second, year-long reign but it was certainly more memorable."
SquaredCircle,"Hawk's pecs are bigger than his head, WTF."
nba,"Jordan's been consistent with this, he's always said you can't compare players between eras. Not that he didn't think he wasn't the greatest during his time, this is the same guy who went into a psychopathic rage if he got perceived as being anything less than the best, but he always kept it within his own era."
nba,"It's LeBron, man. He always finds a way."
SquaredCircle,What? Kane gave Taker a Tombstone which completely knocked him out and allowed HBK to squeak out the win by taking advantage.
SquaredCircle,That just makes it even more hilarious.
nba,"It's not his most dominant performance (2009 and 2018 are just fucking unreal with 2014 and 2017 also worthy of mention) but it was arguably his most well rounded since he did everything well. Score, shoot, defend, pass, rebound, etc."
nba,"Bynum's was in the playoffs, Hibbert's was in the regular season. Hibbert did have a 9 block game in the postseason, though. Maybe that's the one you're thinking about?"
nba,"He can still explode but he picks his spots whereas before, he just did that at will. What impresses me the most now is his absolute control of the game. Teams seem to rarely be able to get Bron out of his game."
nba,"I do wonder if Utah's more rural life also plays a role, even if it sounds like a joke. There's really not much to do there compared to other places."
nba,"That also doesn't correlate to someone being stronger than someone else. Malone was smaller than Shaq so he could lower his center of gravity better and make it uncomfortable for Shaq. That, coupled with his impressive strength, helped him hold his own. Rodman also did the same thing and Shaq also had issues backing him down."
nba,"I've always found it interesting how Jordan always seems to be in the top with these advanced stats despite none of them being a thing during his time. Current players and coaching staff have the advantage of knowing how to best play efficiently whereas Jordan just did it his own way, it just happened to be among the most efficient basketball ever played."
nba,"Advanced stats *really* love The Admiral. It's interesting how close Davis is to him in several aspects: they're both very mobile bigs that displayed elite defense, had good mid-range jumpers, weren't that good at creating their own shot and had troubles in the playoffs due to lackluster teams. 

One interesting difference was that Robinson had more regular season success than Davis ever did until this year."
dragonball,"It would've exploded instead of just turning into sand, which is the effect Hakai has in the manga. Same hand pose, same sand effect."
dragonball,"He started interesting but the more I saw of him, the less I liked him because his personality is just Generic Baddie No. 87 plus he pulls more bullshit abilities than even Buu did. At some point, when a villain just keeps doing ass pulls, it stops being fun and it turns annoying. He's just a pool of gimmicks now."
nba,"Well yeah...that happens when LeBron averages 34/9/9 on 54% shooting, dropping 8 40+ games in the playoffs (a record) and hitting circus shots for game winners."
nba,"And it arguably helped him since it was the first time since 2011 that he had an extended break since he always goes deep into the playoffs. It's a big reason why I was skeptical at people putting Kawhi over LeBron during last year's offseason. It's like they forgot he went scorched Earth in the 2018 playoffs and he was still very good last year while clearly coasting due to lack of a good supporting cast.

So you take a player like that and give him a long break to recover and rest? We all saw what he just did in the playoffs."
nba,"Ernie looks so uncomfortable, it makes it even funnier. It's a legit good joke but he can't laugh *too* much. This is one of my Top 5 Chuck moments in the show."

nba,"He's like an even nerdier, less snarky version of Zach Lowe. They're my two favorite analysts because while they're very knowledgeable about the game, they provide different perspectives. Lowe usually cuts through the BS narratives with his cynicism and Taylor's really good at talking about things you rarely hear mentioned anywhere else like scalability and which passes are more valuable than others."
nba,"What hurts Ben is him being ass on offense and defense not being as valued (even though he's arguably the greatest defender of all time besides Russell).

Another thing is that he had a very short peak, Ben fell off pretty quickly since him being undersized and all hustle meant that any decline in athleticism was going to significantly impact his contributions on the court."
nba,"It's honestly maddening. Kawhi hasn't changed and it seems the media either forgot or gave him a pass for the crap he pulled in San Antonio. Pop's a bigger man than I am because if it were me, I would've told him to kiss my ass after he and his group accused the Spurs of not caring for his health."
nba,"It's not just the sheer number of points, it's more that if someone is going that batshit crazy scoring so many points, chances are they're already blowing the other team out and they'll be pulled by the time they get to 50-60. It's happened with Dame, Harden and Klay."
SquaredCircle,Willis seems to be quite the dick BTS but that's a boss move if I ever heard of one.
nba,"The more I look at it, the more I think people were on something illegal for them to think LA gave up too much. I thought people were insane back then but it makes less sense now that they won the championship in convincing fashion. 

You gave that up for arguably the most skilled PF and versatile PF, alongside KG, to ever play the game. You do that trade 10 times out of 10."
FriendsofthePod,"I almost dropped my phone when I got the notification. Man, I really miss him."
nba,"That was mostly due to Miami's scheme, they got a lot of open looks because Miami was daring them to shoot them."
nba,"Yeah, *that's* the year I point to whenever Duncan's lack of DOPY award is brought that, he should've won it that year. Prior to that, Duncan's prime coincided with Ben Wallace's, someone who's probably the greatest defender the league has had after Russell."
nba,"For what it's worth, Ben Taylor's profile on Stockton says that he was a good passer but not truly elite since many of his passes were pretty vanilla. He explains why and I think he makes a compelling case:

https://backpicks.com/2018/01/25/backpicks-goat-25-john-stockton/

While some may disagree, I think it's interesting and certainly makes me want to look beyond his insane assist stats."
SquaredCircle,"Haha, you can tell that was them messing around and having fun instead of acting in the segment."
nba,"That always bothered me, it's like people forgot the insane run Bron had the year prior. Kawhi had a great run but it falls short compared to Bron's."
dragonball,"> I guess this makes the manga the canon material for the DBS franchise

Not really, it's not like DB that had filler in the anime adaptation. DBS has two canons: manga and anime. There's no contradiction between them as they're different. You might enjoy one over the other, of course, but I always say specify whether I'm talking about the manga or anime when discussing something about, I dunno, Super Saiyan Blue which have different characteristics depending on the source material."
nba,"I don't think he's underrated, you'll always see him in the Top 15. He's just not talked about much since Wilt, Russell, West and Robertson are from that same era and all four of them had better careers."
nba,"'09 LeBron was the single most impressive physical specimen we've seen in the NBA. How the hell was such a big guy routinely jumping out of the building and moving like a 6'2'' point guard? A guy in a Karl Malone body was arguably the fastest player in the league. '13 LeBron had a better balance between power and speed but '09 LeBron just looked straight out of a comic book.

That playoff run in '09 was something else. The game felt easy to him and it's going to be a while since we'll see something like that again. I personally prefer '18 LeBron because his skill was out of this world and dude was doing everything on the court but it's hard to argue his '09 run wasn't better."
nba,"That Game 7, tho. Clips were up and you kinda just *felt* when the momentum was shifting towards the Nuggets. I was watching it live and I just started laughing at how surreal it was. Trailing by double digits and then just blowing the Clips out."
nba,"Yeah...the days after the tragedy, hearing how Gianna wanted to carry on his father's legacy in a different league and knowing Kobe was extremely invested in supporting his daughter just broke me. I truly believe Gianna and Kobe were going to elevate that entire league."
nba,"While I won't get into talking Wilt's feats and how he'd do in today's game, I always found it interesting and sad that such a larger than life figure, who actually took care of himself, died by a heart attack at a relatively young age of 63."
nba,"Yeah, it's pretty dumb and even moreso when AD has stated that it's not that he minds playing Center, it's that it's too hard for him to do it for extended periods. That's the real value of Howard and McGee: they can play the 5 for most of the regular season and let AD conserve himself for the playoffs. As these playoffs have shown, AD doesn't mind playing entire games at the 5.

It's also unfair to call him soft, AD really isn't that bulky and adding more mass would take away from his mobility, which is one of his main strengths."
dragonball,"It's never properly explained but I've always thought that since Goku teleported Cell to North Kaio's planet, Cell somehow picked it up after that. Maybe Goku touching him and teleporting him made him ""sense"" it?"
nba,"Without a doubt. Butler pretty much stalemated LeBron James, who himself had a monstrous series. Up until Game 6, I would've given the edge to Butler but by that time, his body was already giving up on him due to exhaustion whereas LeBron was just normal...dude's not human.


I personally think Butler had a better Finals but Kawhi had a better overall playoffs performance. His performance against Philly was an all-timer and he helped contain Giannis enough for them to win that series (Kawhi *did not* shut down Giannis, that was a team effort but he was a key in them being able to do so). By the time the Finals came around, Kawhi's body was starting to give up on him and you could see him hobbling at times. Butler had a good playoffs but his Finals performance was among the best we've seen."
dragonball,"I've talked about it in the past and I made a point to mention how it's weird he said due to Kaioken being a thing. That's what made me shrug and stop thinking about multipliers. If the creator himself doesn't care about them, makes sense for me to not care either."
dragonball,"https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/seg-story-volume-truth-about-dragon-ball/

> Only, at the time, it was considered that his strength would increase 50-fold when he became a Super Saiyan, but that was a bit of an exaggeration. My feeling as the creator is that, while drawing it, I felt that it was about a 10-fold change from what it was up to that point.

This is why I generally don't bother with multipliers because they make less sense the more you think about them."

nba,LeBron would be an even bigger terror due to his sheer size and strength.
nba,"On just one poll, 538 takes many polls and gives an average score based on how reputable that pollster is."
nba,"Oh yeah, agreed. The fact that he makes 36% with the type of shots he takes is incredible. I wasn't criticizing him, just pointing out how it never feels like he goes supernova from three despite sometimes making 8+ threes in a game."
nba,"I'm seeing a criminal lack of Wallace here. Wallace might've been the best defender in NBA history but he had an *extremely* short peak so that really hurts him.


Greatest is definitely Russell due to no other player being comparable in defensive value to their team."
nba,"A good chunk of his prime coincided with the likes of Mourning, Mutombo and Wallace so that hurt him a bit but also the fact that he wasn't ""sexy"" in terms of highlights. He should've won in 07 but Camby was blocking everything in sight despite that not being a good barometer of how good a defender is."
nba,Robinson was a more dominant defender at his peak due to his insane athleticism but Duncan has a longer period of sustained dominance. It depends on what you value more.
nba,"I always feel weird about Harden's 3PM totals cause it never really feels like he gets hot from 3. Like, he hit 378 threes but it never felt like he was making that many, you know?

You'll see someone else like Dame and when he gets hot, it feels like an explosion. And of course, there's Curry who just feels like he opens the floodgates by just making a couple of threes. I think it's a combination of Harden's insane volume hurting his % and him taking a three after several seconds of dribbling and breaking down his defender."
SquaredCircle,"I'm not sure I'd like another run, the first one was pretty bad for me and it's when I actively started tuning out from WWE. He's proven he can be entertaining as hell but his matches were very boring during that time and I don't feel it'd be any different this time around.

I wouldn't be bothered if they give him another chance. I might tune in for a few shows to see how it goes."
nba,"That always pissed me off about Love. He was a net-positive for the Wolves but he had some truly horrendous teams. There's not much you can do with such a bad team.

Like...dude averaged 26/13 twice, come on."
nba,"Like others have said, that seems to be an issue with having so many streaky shooters. Your offense will stagnate if people are struggling to make open 3's."
dragonball,"> Hey, thanks! Thinking of Gogeta as his own being makes this make more sense. 

This is something I think a good portion of the fandom doesn't realize, fusions are their own beings. Usually, it seems people look at them as merely a combination of their fusees. A good example is how Vegetto acts during battles, while both Goku and Vegeta (especially Vegeta) have talked trash during battles, neither of them have done it like Vegetto does."
nba,"I don't remember about 2018 but in 2017, I think the Cavs were +2 with LeBron on the floor so the Cavs and Warriors were at a stalemate but when he sat down, it was just too much."
SquaredCircle,WCW consistently had better matches than WWF did from it's inception until 2000 when WWF really improved in that regard. The under and mid-card in WCW was incredible.

This is something I never hear people mention when they compare COVID-19 to the Flu. This has already killed more than the Flu with us, mostly, taking measures to prevent the spread whereas no such thing is done for the seasonal flu. It's especially irksome when I see people compare them both while missing that context and also considering that the year hasn't ended."
dragonball,"As others have said, that's how it is in the OG Japanese version and it was a holdover from the early DBZ internet days.

In other cases, such as mine, I grew up with the Mexican dub so I use SSJ just because that's how I grew up. I will say ""Saiyan"" and ""Namek"" when I'm talking in English, though. Inversely, I'll say ""Saiya-jin"" and ""Namekku-seijin"" when talking in Spanish because they're *very* accurate with those terms and that's what they used. That made for some confusion at first since Namek's was called ""Namekku-sei"" and my kid self took a while to get when they were talking about the people and when they were talking about the people."
SquaredCircle,Those game have NOT aged well. I thought they were the shit until I went to a friend's house and played WM2000. The THQ games made the Acclaim games feel dated even then!
dragonball,"I mean...there's no way of knowing. I personally would prefer if UI is his final form because it's unique and different since it's completely separate from this SSJ forms. Plus, it looks amazing."
nba,"But he signed *because* of the FO's competence and the culture that vibes with his own style. Plus, Miami's a fantastic city for NBA players."
nba,"You can't help but laugh, Hero is trying his damnedest to impede LeBron but he just bulldozes him out of the way."
nba,Problem is that a lot of them are good looks. They're not shooting them just for the hell of it but this team has way too many streaky shooters.
nba,"At this point, it's a coinflip. Bron's playmaking vs Davis' insane defense."
nba,"I legit didn't doubt Dwight. His problem stemmed more from his attitude rather than his diminished athleticism. He refused to play in a way that would maximize his current skills for the modern game. Obviously, he's a shell of his former shelf but he's still an athletic monster."
nba,"What's more devastating is that a coach, don't remember who, once talked about how LeBron told an opposing player where he was supposed to be. That has to be a horrible feeling, this guy *knows* what you're about to do and he *knows* you're doing it wrong but he's so confident in himself that he's telling you about it. He's not really saying it to help you out, he's saying it to break you mentally."

I admit, I was confused for a second."
nba,"Windy called him out by name on the pod he did with Lowe and Burke (only for 5 minutes before tech issues got in the way). I've been a fan of Bill for more than a decade now but his constant saltiness towards the Lakers this season has been something else. If any season deserves to *not* have an asterisk, it's this one. Everyone's in the same conditions and there's no home court advantage either."
nba,It's ridiculous how you can clearly see LeBron holding himself back on-purpose yet still dominate. It makes it even more amazing when he lets lose and just decides to unleash all of his talents. Game 5 Bron against Denver was unfair.
nba,That defense in the third quarter was absolutely insane.
nba,He's always thrown shade at LeBron despite him acknowledging him as the second greatest player ever but this year has been ridiculous. I still enjoy listening to him because he can place things into historical context better than anyone else but his takes have gotten progressively worse with each passing year.
nba,"Pretty much this. IIRC, the Cavs had a higher offensive rating than even the Warriors did during the playoffs but their defense sucked."
nba,It was amazing seeing Jokic getting pushed around as if he was a kid. Dwight's still an athletic monster.
nba,"> I think he wanted to shatter that ""Cool headed, balanced Biden"" persona and succeeded.

Not fair, even Chris Wallace had enough of Trump's shit and you never see a moderator get pissed off like that."
nba,"Problem with this is that they're gaslighting you into trying to make you feel lame and overtly sensitive.

No, you prick. Some things aren't pleasant to joke about. It's not me being a snowflake, it's you being an asshole."
nba,"Dude could legit get buckets like crazy with his post moves but yeah, that was the only thing he did. Also, his post play was limited by him not drawing too many fouls so it's not like it was actually an effective way for a team to get points."
SquaredCircle,NBA Twitter peaked that day.
nba,"Yeah, as others have said, that year was more of an anomaly for LeBron. That was his worst shooting playoff run and by not an insignificant margin. His entire shot was off during the RS and playoffs."
dragonball,"Yeah, Rose isn't really a different form per se, it's just what a Saiyan would look like if they transformed while being a god."
nba,I think that McGee would've sulked if he was coming out of the bench whereas Dwight's been humbled for the past 2 years so he was OK with it.
dragonball,"I've mentioned it on other posts but I happen to think he's right near Beerus' level due to how Beerus reacted after he transformed. He has *never* praised anyone like he did in the previous chapter, calling his form perfect and outright comparing Goku to a god. What I still find particularly interesting is how Beerus talked to Goku after he noticed his presence. Whereas before he would've been impatient and ordered Goku to hurry up, this time it was different. When he said, ""Don't stop now. Finish the job so we can eat,"" it didn't feel like an order to me nor was he rushing Goku. It felt like Beerus was extremely intrigued as to what was happening and he was actually talking to Goku as a peer."
nba,"Simmons clowned them hard when they made all their moves, mostly because of his Celtics homerism, but he honestly did one hell of a job with such short notice. I always thought they'd win 55+ wins although I admit I didn't see Bron + AD clicking as well as they did."
nba,"Because despite how big their markets are, you need a competent FO to truly make it a desirable destination. If any of them had a decent FO that lacked any of the usual drama, they'd get more looks. As it stands, they *do* get consideration but never as a first option."
nba,"Gawd, KD used to drive me crazy with that shit. It wouldn't surprised me if he got half his free throws just from that move."
TropicalWeather,It's between Gilbert and Haiyan for me with Tip following behind. These three are the storms that you can just tell by looking at them that they're that absurdly powerful.

nba,I used to think Reggie was overrated because his counting stats weren't that impressive but Taylor really made me realize how little I know.
FriendsofthePod,"That was Jeff Sessions and Tapper not only called him out, he called the tweet disgusting and said he lacked humanity. That was a big reason why I unsubbed to Keep It after a few listens. I had already figured out that the show wasn't for me but when I found out about that incident, that sealed it."
dragonball,"I highly doubt she'd want her death to have such a negative impact on the franchise. It's turned into a global phenomenon that's beloved by young kids and adults. She probably has an understudy that's ready to take her place if her health is compromised. I highly doubt it, though. She's still kicking ass! Her performance as Black was incredible. 

The only person that would affect the franchise in such a way would be Toriyama himself."
dragonball,"SSJG isn't really a Super Saiyan form, it's mostly called that for marketing purposes. It's why Vegeta can ""skip"" SSJ3. Even though it's non-canon, it's the same reason why he could go SSJ4 in GT: SSJ4 is not really a Super Saiyan form or a continuation of the normal SSJ forms."
Games,I put over 100 hours over that thing. It's not the best MGS but it's arguably the most fun I had playing one due to the coop.
nba,"> Man... Dwight is still so athletic for a 34 year old but he was so damn more athletic back in 2009. 

His back injury really fucked him up. There was a noticeable decline in athleticism after that. He was terrifying during his prime, jumping out of the building while being that gigantic."
nba,He's just like LeBron: both still look big but they were just *massive* in their primes. Prime Dwight looked like a sculpture.
nba,"Fuck, I'm hyped for more delicious meme content from you."
dragonball,"My only real nitpick was Goku and Vegeta not using SSJBKKx20 and SSJBE respectively before deciding to fuse. I don't know if it's because Broly is following the manga more closely than the anime but I reckon way more people have been exposed to the anime and it seemed weird for Goku and Vegeta to have to resort to fusion without using their most powerful SSJ forms.

I would also like for Vegeta to blast Goku for not using UI only for Goku to reiterate than he *can't* access it at will and doesn't know how. 

One last thing is for Whis to give a less vague statement as to how Broly compares to Beerus. Best we got was Goku thinking he's stronger than Beerus but only Beerus and Whis would know that."
dragonball,"Agreed, Imperfect Cell was just creepy as hell and is actually very strategic with how he carries out his plans. He became generic the moment he absorbed 17 and became a Frieza clone when be became Perfect."
dragonball,"Beerus doesn't hate anybody, especially anyone from the gang. He's actually quite sociable and from what we've seen, genuinely enjoys socializing with them beyond just eating. Just look at how he was with Bulla. He didn't mind her being on his chest and he actually brought her toys with them when he moved to the beach. 

He won't get that fond of them, though. He's still a god who's lived millions of years so his perspective of time is different. 

He does think Frieza's a cunt, obviously."
dragonball,"That figure was pretty much retconned with the anime. Beerus is *much* stronger than what the movies imply. Otherwise, Goku would've surpassed him with just BlueKK."
nba,"Really? The SPURS? People respect them but they sure as hell aren't popular. 

2011 OKC? That's random as hell.

The only teams that compare in terms of popularity are the 2013 Heat and the 2016 Warriors and the Bulls are still on another level."
dragonball,"SSBKK in the manga isn't a thing like in the anime, though. He applied it against Jiren but his body crapped out quickly whereas in the anime, Goku can use it freely after getting used to it. Like I mentioned in a previous post, I lean towards SSBKKx20 being equal to SSBE."
nba,And then people wonder why stars join superteams. There's an embarrassing amount of people who only think someone's good or not based on rings.

dragonball,"By the time Goku managed to pair the KKx20 with Blue, he had overcome it's effects as he pretty much spammed it liberally during the TOP without any indication of stamina loss or side effects on his body so it's just as good as if it were another form. The anime didn't portray either of them as having an edge over the other. I'm inclined to believe that they're equal."
dragonball,"Ever since both achieved SSB, they've consistently been portrayed as equals. Maybe Vegeta had an edge when they went back to fight Black but I don't think it's as much as people think since Goku was the one that almost *killed* Fused Zamasu with a Kamehameha (bullshit as it was). Since then, they've again been portrayed as equals. Even with Vegeta unlocking SSBE, one of the directors stated that it's roughly on par with SSBKKx20."
dragonball,"Beerus is still an unknown factor since both the manga and anime still haven't clearly shown how strong he is. Only thing we know is that he may be the strongest of the GoDs due to his showing in the Battle Royale for Zeno.

I personally think that based on Beerus' reaction to Goku in the last chapter, he's getting very close since Beerus was genuinely impressed with Goku and compared him to a god. Hell, Beerus and Whis both actually winced from the shockwave of Goku's punch to Moro. I don't recall them *ever* reacting to an attack so that speaks to Goku's current power. Also, the way he talked to him at the end didn't seem like he was ordering him around, more like requesting him be done with it. Almost as if he was talking to him like a peer."
dragonball,"Only Belmod, Beerus is implied to be among the strongest of the GoDs, maybe even the strongest one considering everyone was gunning after him and he still managed to be the last one standing along with Quitela (Belmod doesn't count since he was faking it)."
nba,That's the simplest and best way I've seen someone explain Bill's charm.

SquaredCircle,"I don't pretend Shawn wasn't a prick in the 90's, he was arguably the biggest dick in wrestling history during that time, but he at least recognized it and tried to do amends about it. Was he perfect? No and nobody is and I sure as hell didn't say he changed completely, just that he changed so it's not cool to put words in my mouth. 

In any case, you'll always have people who take things wrong with you. Sometimes there's bad vibe between two people no matter what. Even Cena has had people talk shit about him like Reks and Riley (although he did seem to dislike Riley because of...something?).

Hogan's always been an politicking asshole and there's never been any indication that he ever stopped. Sure, he put over talents when he came back to WWF/E but he was over 50 years old by that time, it's rare to see wrestlers that age still go over people yet he still went over Orton, someone who was half his age."
SquaredCircle,"It's why Miro going after him bothered me so much. Meltzer's not TMZ, he's a boring dude with a sloppy office that just reports what he's told. What makes it worse was that Miro admitted he didn't read what Meltzer wrote about Lana, someone told him instead. He really thinks Meltzer was blaming Lana for the name thing when all he said was that a source told him she was what made WWE say ""Enough"". In other words, if it wasn't Lana, it would've been someone else."
dragonball,I just laughed because Beerus and Whis are right there. I don't think Moro realizes he's fucked either way since Beerus will probably kill him if Goku messes up.
SquaredCircle,Well...um...y-you know...it is what it is.
nba,"Yeah, I've always found it weird that people genuinely think Bron should've gotten more MVPs. The only year you could argue was 2011, every other year someone had a bigger impact during the regular season since Bron coasts a lot. Then come the playoffs and people are like ""THIS is why he's the MVP!""

No.

That just means he's still the best player in the league. The MVP is a regular season award and everyone since who won after his 2013 MVP had a better argument over him."
nba,"Yeah, you know but it seems like being in the bubble for so long can start to get irritating since you have nowhere you can go for yourself to cool off."
SquaredCircle,"That's probably the only match that's beloved by everyone due to someone being ""unprofessional"" since we all know Hogan's a sack of shit and deserved it for screwing Michaels. Michaels was no saint himself in the 90's, as we all know, but he had changed by this time and didn't really care for politics by that point. Seeing him get annoyed to the point of summoning his 90's self was just amazing."
dragonball,"> Hey, whatever gives our boi Vegeta another chance to actually finish a boss fight

I should clarify, my reaction was more of a ""Oh shit"" moment rather than being dumbfounded that Goku's going to spare Moro and fuck up. I genuinely think something different is going to happen because it'd make no sense for Meerus to sacrifice himself like that and Goku to simply do the same shit he does."
dragonball,"That's honestly my impression or at least that Goku's about to do something that'll make Beerus and Whis worry because it's out of character for him. It also wouldn't make sense for Goku to be all like ""Nan, not killing you"" after Meerus sacrificed his entire existence just so Goku would have a chance to finish it. Why even mention Goku's shallow reason for fighting if you're not going to do anything with it?"

I used to shit on Cole in the mid-to-late 2000's before I realized what he was actually doing. I think Cole's the only one who's able to really manage Vince's demands at that level. There's a video of him getting an earful from Vince after Cole pushed back against promoting something for the umpteenth time so he's definitely self-aware of how ridiculous WWE commentary can get at times."

It definitely is. The worst line that I can remember was someone saying Vince was never worried about WCW.

First of all, fuck you. Secondly, fuck you. It takes some *cojones* to say that with a straight face in a doc aimed at those who lived through that time. I usually just roll my eyes when WWE goes all in on revisionist history but that was genuinely insulting."

TropicalWeather,Is that why no Cat 5 has had a peak wind speed of 170 mph?
dragonball,"No, I meant that both the manga and anime are inconsistent between themselves to the point that there's two canons."
billsimmons,"> The comments he gets about his weight on this website are abhorrent, though. Fuck that.

It's been 15 years of that shit and people don't get tired of it. It's stupid and immature."
dragonball,"Yeah, that's something that bothers me with both Super formats. Both of them are inconsistent with each other and one character can be drastically weaker or stronger. Hit's only SSJG level in the manga and Kefla is equal to Ultimate Gohan.

Then you have what happened with the Zamasu arc in which both of them have different aspect to the lore. For example, Zamasu is still an apprentice Kaioshin in the manga but in the anime, he's referred to as the actual Supreme Kai of Universe 10. The healing stuff bothered me because it makes no sense why an apprentice would have such a useful ability only to lose it when he gets promoted to Kaioshin."
nba,"Just wish his prime was longer. He gets ignored sometimes because he only had 7 elite seasons since he came in as a 24 year old rookie due to his Naval service.

(Also because Hakeem kicked his ass in '95...)"
nba,I can see your point but the Corolla is objectively a better car in every aspect due to various enhancements and innovations that have taken place in the interval between both cars being produced. What you mean is that the Cadillac has a greater legacy and is the greater car.
nba,"I was just thinking about that. Nowadays, it's weird if you're a Center and *don't* shoot threes."
dragonball,"That whole arc was filled with power scaling inconsistencies. Trunks beating Fused Zamasu isn't the worse thing as you can chalk that up to Fused Zamasu's power being unstable due to his semi-immortality + the beating Vegito gave him.

Goku would've *killed* Fused Zamasu with a Kamehameha had it not being for Zamasu's immortality! They didn't even bother busting out a KKx20 for it; that at least would've made some sense and it would've been cool Goku debuting it like that vs futilely using it against Jiren."
dragonball,"> SSJ3 wins because it is a 400x multiplier

I wouldn't use the ""official"" multiplier for this; multipliers don't come from Toriyama himself and he thinks the 50x multiplier for SSJ1 that the Danizeshuu came up with was too much which means he thinks the same for SSJ2 and SSJ3.

https://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/seg-story-volume-truth-about-dragon-ball/

> Only, at the time, it was considered that his strength would increase 50-fold when he became a Super Saiyan, but that was a bit of an exaggeration. My feeling as the creator is that, while drawing it, I felt that it was about a 10-fold change from what it was up to that point.

Granted, that kinda goes against what the KK is so make that what you will but I personally stopped thinking about them because they completely break the power scale. If SSJ3 is 400 times stronger than base then SSJG should at least be 1000 times stronger and then what of Blue? 2000 times? Now add the KKx20 and Goku's 400000 times stronger!"
dragonball,Stuffed crust pizzas
SquaredCircle,I didn't forget him but both Austin and Rock drew more at their peaks.
SquaredCircle,"Yeah, Austin's drawing power at his peak is unmatched. Only Rock comes close which is just a testament to how utterly insane WWF was back then: the two biggest draws in wrestling history were in the same company during the same period. We'll never see that again."
nba,"While this series is his overall best, I enjoyed more the previous series against the Lakers because it was when we first started having an inkling that Dirk was going to do something special. I remember seeing Bynum throw his hands up in the air with a look of disbelief after Dirk made another fadeaway in his face despite playing good defense on him."
nba,"That's....putting it lightly. It's not just Mavs fans that are mad about that series, it's something general fans are also still irked about."
nba,"Which is why it annoyed me people were so quick to appoint him as the best. LeBron literally averaged 34/9/9 with *eight* 40+ point games in the playoffs the year prior, which is tied for most in NBA Playoffs history with Jerry West's '65 run."
dragonball,"It's between SSJ1 and MUI. SSJ1 Is definitely the most important transformation in the series and it caught me completely off guard as a kid. The situation felt beyond hopeless with Frieza surviving the Genki Dama and then THAT happened. 

UI was just cool because they've been hinting at it so much and it wasn't an explosion of energy or rage, it just happened. Plus, seeing the GoDs stand up and the GP looking intrigued just sold how much of a monumental achievement Goku's ascension was."
TropicalWeather,"It almost happened with Wilma in 05 since a storm was found afterwards during postseason analysis. Had they found it first, Wilma would've been Alpha and it would've been retired as Alpha 2005."
TropicalWeather,Gilbert takes it for me. It's fitting since the storm was absolutely gigantic and it's the only Atlantic storm to get an 8.0 rating on the Dvorak scale.
dragonball,I think you're drastically underestimating how powerful Cell was compared to everyone else except Gohan. All of them combined would've done absolutely nothing.
nba,"Now wait a second, let's not get ahe-

*thinks*

Who am I kidding? This is LeBron James, of course it's possible."
nba,"Honestly, it annoys me that the media and casual fans give him a pass for that. Had it been another player, they would've crucified him. I just don't buy the act that Kawhi is this simple guy: all actions during that time painted him as being very shade and dishonest. The Spurs did nothing wrong."
nba,"That's a bit unfair, though. It's not that people don't care or like the Nuggets, Joker's really popular in this sub, but it's just so fucking *hilarious* how the Clippers lost after talking so much shit throughout the year and acting like they've three-peated."
nba,"Because Wade's body broke down *quick* after the 2011 season. Also, sneaky little secret about Wade and Bron: despite their telepathic chemistry at times, they were never a great fit due to their overlapping skillsets. They made it work due to their sheer talent, of course."
nba,"Dirk's legacy as a Top 15-20 player was cemented just with that ring. Only West and Robertson are above him in my list of greats with just one ring. That ring counted for like...I dunno, 2-2.5 rings?"
nba,That run was just fucking insane. 2009 LeBron might've been the most athletic player we've ever seen.
SquaredCircle,"Read my mind. Usually with WWE, you can tell how something's going to go after...2-3 shows with an angle. All those who were laughing once Harper came back didn't even wait for that, they were instantly mocking any one who believed it. Of course, we all know what happened shortly afterwards.

That's why I stopped watching WWE. It's not like I'm some master of booking or anything like that but with WWE, it's pretty transparent when they are into something or not."
nba,I rarely enjoy taking in the miseries of others but....this pleases me.
nba,Good Lord....the Nuggets are actually going to be the first team to come back from a 3-1 series deficit TWICE.
apple,"$599 for 64GB and $749 for 256GB? That's insultingly high and at that price, why not get a 128GB Pro for $799? Better screen, ProMotion, better speakers, FaceID and despite having the A14, the Pro has more cores so the performance is still superior....this seems weird as hell to up the Air in price to the point that it makes the Pro seem like a more reasonable option.

Does this mean they'll update the Pro soon? If they do, it has to be a pretty substantial upgrade to an already impressive device. I reckon the price will reflect that and make the Air seem reasonable."
nba,He shot above 32% just once in his career (excluding his '96 season which he only played 32 games) which means that was an outlier year. I think Magic qualifies for this and he was the second person that came to my mind after Rubio.
nba,It's weird because he's been saying he's the second best player ever for a while now but he just takes these potshots at LeBron that just seem excessively harsh and unfounded.
nba,With Raining Blood playing in the background when Russ comes into the screen.
WatchPeopleDieInside,OP's friend here: my friends should let me sleep a bit more.
nba,"It's weird cause if Toronto goes against anyone else that year, you think they're winning no matter what, but against LeBron + anyone? The sweep wasn't surprising."
SquaredCircle,"They're not related by blood, though. Their grandfathers were so close that they considered themselves as brothers and their respective families regard each other as such."
SirkComeModMe,Gimme a sec...I've literally been a mod for like 30 minutes.
SirkComeModMe,"Removed, felt like it."
nba,"As a Robinson fan in the 90's, 1995 was *not* fun."
dragonball,"Haha, he even ends up in the same pose!"
SquaredCircle,"> He doesn't try to force his opinion on basketball, just reports when he sees and hears and how.

He used to back in Yahoo days. You could tell whether someone was a source or not based on how he writes about someone. He notoriously wrote tons of shit about LeBron because LeBron's famously very tight with who talks to.

This was also shown when he used to write good things about Joe Dumars....and then Dumars got fined 500 grand because the league was getting annoyed with memos getting leaked so they sent out different version of the same memo with a few key different words. A few months later, Wok leaks something and the league traced it back to Dumars."
SquaredCircle,I don't think he had to sell much....ouch
nba,"Yeah, that's something that's been noticeable the last few years. He can score like crazy but his attack isn't varied at all. He may be absurdly efficient with the insane usage he has but he's consistently fallen short in the playoffs with a noticeable drop in TS%."
dragonball,"I do because death is of literally no consequence now. Piccolo died a few arcs ago but that was barely touched upon and quickly forgotten. 

Hell, we just saw 17 revives trillions of lives.

By Meerus staying dead, his death would have an impact on Goku."
nba,"He isn't, though. Among qualified players in the postseason, Turner ranks first with 4. The OP specified that this is only for players who are still playing."
SquaredCircle,"Some of them don't actually read what he writes and get their information from second hand sources who sometimes misquote Meltzer. He's not perfect but he owns up to when he's wrong and in a business that's still pretty carny, he might be the closest thing we can get to the truth. Journalism isn't perfect in the sense that you won't be .1000 since your sources can turn out to be shitty but I've been a sub for a while and he generally gets it right or he gets proven right in the long run like what happened with the Saudi Arabia plane fiasco or when Miro got mad Meltzer reported he was injured, denied it....and then it turned out he was indeed injured."
dragonball,"I agree with Toriyama on this. He's not a bad person but he's not qualified to be a father. It really speaks to Chichi as a mother that Gohan and Goten turned out to be well adjusted even after all the shit they've been through.

For what it's worth, his family seems to be OK with it."
dragonball,"The only power levels I take seriously are the ones we saw when Radditz came up until Trunks was scanned at 5, since he was hiding his ki.

When Vegeta in TFS went ""Power levels are bullshit!"", my mind didn't actually go to the SSJ multipliers and shit, my mind went to the ""official"" power levels pre-Radditz. They're arguably even more bullshit because they barely make any sense. For example, Goku should've never been able to kill Gohan as he'd still be weak compared to him, who has one of Roshi's top students. Another one that bothered me was Goku only getting 10 times stronger from kid to young adult...then he proceeds to go from 8000-9000 from 150 million in a week. Even without SSJ, he still shot up to 3 million in base."
nba,FUCK that postseason run for him. I was going insane with him playing substantial minutes for the heat.
nba,Also because he has a streakier jumper than most scorers and people think he just barrels his way to the hoop.
nba,I really like Kawhi but I've always felt he was kinda overrated in that regard. He's been a certified Top 5 player since 2016 but I've never felt he was *the* top player.
nba,"I look at these and obviously it's seriously impressive....then I remember he fucking averaged 34/9/9 2 years ago and he averaged 35/9/8 during his first MVP season *12* years ago.

He just just keeps churning quality season after quality season."
nba,"Honestly, the fact that they're all in the bubble might mitigate that fatigue. They don't need to get on a plane to travel and they can all sleep in the same bed rather than a different one.

Butler's definitely cracking like a maniac right now, though."
dragonball,"I don't mean any offense but while I know it's fun, fans really shouldn't think about these questions because DB can be summed up as Toriyama pulling things out of his ass that just happened to work wonderfully.

Many of these questions can be answered with a simple shrug emoji."
nba,"I've always liked Burke but after she told Javie to fuck off on live TV, I want more of her!"
SquaredCircle,">  If you cannot get back up in 10 seconds, that's it fight's over.

It's even more strict than that, you can get up in time but the ref will stop it if he sees you're not ""there""."
nba,"He's still an insane athlete but he was an absolutely monster in his prime. It says a lot about him that he's *still* getting up there despite a noticeable decline.

And again, noticeable decline for him means he's still a Top 5 athlete in the league."
SquaredCircle,"It always felt he could reach the other turnbuckle if he so wished, still my favorite Frog Splash. I really loved how sold his own move, wincing in pain and gasping for air. Really sells how the move is so devastating, it also hurts him."
nba,"Ah man, I just replied to the same comment with this. I didn't see this comment but yeah, I thought that was a good point by Zach and I felt dumb for not seeing it sooner."
nba,"Zach Lowe said on one of his last pods that there aren't really secrets among coaches because if he could spot things out by watching games on a laptop, then certainly a team of coaches can also spot it."
nba,That's the value of James' blocks and what makes other players be worried about him....that and the fact that it's pretty demoralizing getting denied like that.
nba,"> One is LeBron and his ""feel-out game 1"" and his ability to adapt. He can dominate games in different ways depending on what is needed. It was very likely he would figure it out.

As big of a LeBron fan as I am, I always roll my eyes at statements like these because there's no way to prove them but as Bron's athleticism has eroded and his sheer skill and BBIQ compensate for it....I'm a believer. I've heard opposing coaches being filled with stress at trying to game plan against LeBron cause he figures things out *very* fast."
nba,"Plus with Curry missing a lot of time, I can see him getting passed in total threes. However, I don't think we'll see someone make as many shots *and* with such high efficiency."
nba,"Karl Malone had arguably the worst one: Mailfraud.

I don't like Malone due to reasons we don't need to get into but that nickname was just devastating."
SquaredCircle,"He can pull it off, though. He looks intimidating as hell."
dragonball,"> Willing to put others at risk or abandon his family for the sake to fight a strong opponent.

I mean...that's literally what happened with Vegeta. He let him go because he wanted to fight him again despite Vegeta being an utter and despicable prick at that time. Goku's not really changed at all, it's just that the dub is now more accurate to Goku's original characterization."
SquaredCircle,'97 Austin was something else. Just non-stop talking shit to everyone. '98 was the peak of Austin but '97 is his most balanced version since he wasn't affected by injuries.
dragonball,"He probably could, he has the power to brute force his way into it like Gotenks did. I figured he thinks it's a useless form to acquire since he now has three more powerful SSJ forms that he can access and all three are not only vastly more powerful but they don't have an insane stamina drain like 3 does."
nba,"I think that Pizza incident predated QAnon but it's the same type of stupidity. I remember reading that and being too horrified to see the humor in it. On paper, it sounds like a sketch but someone could've gotten hurt or killed."
PS4,"I'm honestly surprised they've let EA do their thing, they've pretty much done malpractice with the IP."
SquaredCircle,"> Anyway he got humiliated just as much as Paige and got nowhere near the amount of support.

I don't think so since all Brad got was his private stuff exposed, which is pretty embarrassing of course, but Paige got slut shammed for daring to have consensual sex."
nba,"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/2005%E2%80%9306_NBA_season#/By_conference

You're not wrong, this is a mess."
nba,"I think the greatest testament to his greatness is that despite being the consensus GOAT, there's still stuff that you see that makes you go, ""Wait...that can't be right. What the hell?!"""
TropicalWeather,"After having gone through the stress of Irma almost making landfall and Maria then actually making landfall while I was still living in Puerto Rico, having another monster Cat 5 storm near me was just too much at times."
nba,"I think it was Ben Taylor and Nate Duncan that did a pod about the most overrated players of all time and his name came up because of how selfish he played and how empty his stats were. His scoring numbers were really insane but they fail to communicate that his teams had crappy offenses because he *was* the offense. He held the ball for too damn much and only took shots he could make, passing it at the last second to another teammate if he was running out of time."
nba,"> Jordan in the 1992 1st round: 45 PPG on 67% TS

*chokes and spits water*



Edit: 

Yes, I know this was only in three games and that First Round series were Best-of-Five. I've been watching the NBA since 1992 and it's also you can easily look at in Bball-Ref. 

Fact is that it doesn't matter if it was a 3 game sweep, those stats are still insane and you'd have a hard time naming anyone else who did that. I don't know where to find that since I can't do it on Bball-Ref anymore.

Seeing so many replies saying about it being a 3 game sweep makes me think it's an attempt at minimizing a pretty cool stat."
nba,Especially in the Finals. The last 4 Game 7's we've had in the Finals have just been *brutal*. Every bucket feels like they're worth double the amount of points.
TropicalWeather,"Wait, what the hell? Didn't Nana *just* form? I want off this ride, please."
TropicalWeather,Yeah and there's also the fact that Haiyan just looks absolutely insane in IR. Much more impressive than Patricia.
TropicalWeather,"Yeah, there's been rumblings for years that some storms have been underestimated due to the lack of direct observations. For example, many users here believe that Haiyan may have been the most intense storm in history."
movies,Definitely. I sometimes get the urge to rewatch the first two seasons of House of Cards but my feeling towards Spacey have prevented me from doing so.
dragonball,"It's pretty much a given that they'll continue, it's just a matter of when. They'd be beyond insane to leave Super hanging like that since the show is very popular and the manga's still ongoing so it's not like it actually finished.

I think they're taking this time to focus on other things and let the manga get ahead of the show so it doesn't end up falling drastically behind like it did last time. The manga had to pretty much skip 95% of the TOP just to finally get up to speed."
dragonball,"I don't know why many users in this sub seem to underestimate Kefla. Fusions have been shown to have a gigantic multiplier; the best example is Base Gogeta being stronger than both Goku and Vegeta in their Blue forms since Broly was kicking their asses whereas Gogeta was casually fighting him in Base.


I believe LSSJ2 Kefla can only be beaten by UI Goku and Jiren. The fact that UI Goku wasn't even able to significantly damage her shows she's very powerful. Of course, this is due to Whis explaining that Goku's attacks are less damaging than they should be but everything indicates that his power is still superior to SSBKK despite this shortcoming. This is shown when the first time that Jiren was shown to be significantly damaged was when Goku punched him in the gut shortly after he went UI for the third time.

Now if you're talking about the manga then yes, Kefla's behind both Goku and Vegeta."
dragonball,It makes sense for Beerus to be this huge obstacle to overcome: he's the GoD and is over 100 million years old. Goku finally beating Beerus is going to be a huge deal.
SquaredCircle,God damn that Spirit Bomb looks so fucking *awesome*!
dragonball,"That 70% figure was Toriyama giving a rough outline of how Goku, Beerus and Whis compared in power. I think it's pretty clear that wasn't anything canonical and Super has done away with that since SSBKK without any multipliers would've surpassed Beerus yet we know that wasn't enough. We don't even know if UI Goku is at Beerus level."
nba,"Fixed, thank you."
nba,"Sophomore season after coming back from his foot injury, Jordan faced against the Bucks in his rookie season."
nba,Laimbeer used to do shit that would make Zaza blush. Fuck Bill Laimbeer.
dragonball,Imma have to go with Gogeta. Fusion has an absolutely insane multiplier and *Base* Gogeta is stronger than Goku and Vegeta in their Blue forms.
dragonball,"I have trouble placing 18 above Piccolo since, unlike 17, she hasn't been active after the Cell Arc. Piccolo should be considerably above her since he's actually been keeping up. Placing him is quite hard since he's had very inconsistent showings and he's sneakily the character who gets the biggest power boosts between arcs. I have absolutely no idea where to place him.

In the current arc, Piccolo's yet again made a big boost and it's stated he's not that far from Gohan IIRC. I'd feel comfortable placing him at 17's level."
dragonball,"Logically, both fusions should be stronger than Beerus. Whis is on another league, though."
politics,"Dude, the convention bump is a thing. It's normal for a politician to temporarily gain a few points. McCain gained something like 8-10 points after the 2008 RNC.  That's also not a good use of polling, you can't just use one poll immediately after an event. You have to wait like a week or two to see if the trend sticks in *several* polls."
dragonball,"Frieza's more evil whereas Zamasu/Black is just insane and deranged. Out of the two, Black's a worse villain since he killed all the gods, all mortal life and cause Zeno to destroy an entire multiverse."
SquaredCircle,"Name sounded familiar so I looked it up and holy fucking shit, I forgot how fucking depraved that motherfucker was."
dragonball,"Man, I can see it going either way. I have absolutely no opinion on the matter since I think both outcomes have value: honoring her work by doing something different or honoring her work by continuing the same style.

As an aside, how fucking amazing is Nozawa in Super? She can still *go* and her performance as Black was incredible."
dragonball,"That's different, though. Neither the manga or the anime are more official than the other, they're both adaptations that come from Toriyama's story that's given to the anime production team and Toyotaro. Unlike the original manga and anime, they're wildly different from each other and have divergent lore and background details.

For example, Blue has a *massive* energy drain in the manga whereas in the anime, Goku and Vegeta have no problems maintaining it."
dragonball,"Took three fighters to defeat him? How is that relevant? All three were severely weakened with Goku barely being able to transform to SSJ1. You really think Base Goku can even tickle Kefla when she wrecked him while he was using SSJBKKx20 and it took UI Goku to defeat her? Mind you, UI Goku wasn't even damaging her so for all three to be able to hurt her doesn't make any sense. 

You can have 100 fighters go against one dude, it doesn't matter if the gap is huge."
dragonball,"Why do people think Jiren would win? Kefla's way above Golden Frieza, who was beating weakened Jiren despite himself being pretty weakened from his earlier battles. Golden Frieza's equal to Goku SSJB, which proved useless against Kefla since Goku had to whip out SSJBKKx20 just to stand a chance."
dragonball,"A big reason why Shin and Beerus are so ineffective is because they barely talk with each other. It hasn't been until now that they're having more contact and that's mainly due to Goku and the gang.

Beerus is supposed to destroy planets that aren't advancing well enough and destroy any threats that can unbalance the universe. As we've seen, he destroys based on petty reasons and he ignores any threats to the universe as he doesn't see it as his problem *despite* it being a part of his job. Shin pointed out how lazy he was.

Shin's issues are more due to his lack of preparation as he wasn't supposed to be *the* Supreme Kai of U7. He's way too hands off with his approach, as Beerus points out, preferring not to get involved with civilizations. The only exception was with Buu and that was because Beerus wasn't doing his job. His also still fairly green and is still learning.

From what we've seen, the universes with higher mortal levels tend to have gods that have better relationships with each other. This is especially evident with Belmod and Cae, who get along quite well and regularly speak with each other."
TropicalWeather,"Yeah, I saw that. It looks more comparable to Katrina or Rita."
TropicalWeather,WTF is this thing? It's just like Michael: a storm that was initially forecasted to be Cat1-2 suddenly explodes and keeps getting stronger.
dragonball,"I've posted before that I think Whis knew Merus was set on his ways and he respected his decision. I also think Whis was indirectly helping Goku by letting Merus interfere. Whis paints himself as nonchalant and indifferent but I think he cares more than he lets on. Also, he's quite invested in Goku and Vegeta but he can't interfere too much due to his very existence being on the line. He knows his role is to guide, not to intervene."
SquaredCircle,The best thing about these is how sometimes Rhoode would be annoyed at these two and then slowly....just nod and go back to what he was doing. It's like he himself couldn't deny how *glorious* it was.
SquaredCircle,"Even ignoring how much of a god he looked like, when you have a guy that had a year-long reign and would routinely lift people like Big Show, Kane and Khali...it's very hard to keep calling him an underdog."
SquaredCircle,Long story short: they lost a beloved NBA tean because the new owner bought them with the promise of keeping them there only to then move them the following year. It was such bullshit since they were a historically relevant franchise.
dragonball,But....he has IT in Movie 6.
SquaredCircle,I thought I was going insane because that pic looks nothing like the KKK shown on Raw.
SquaredCircle,"How can you not love her? She's cool, funny and does an excellent job. I think WWE realizes they were lucky to have her for as long as they did since you could tell she could go on to bigger things."
SquaredCircle,"> They booked him like complete shit, had him regularly lose week after week, but he still got over with the crowd because he's The damn Rock.

It also helped that Rock was always getting screwed and he always came off as being able to beat anyone's ass without any shenanigans."
dragonball,"I don't think Videl's like Chi-Chi, who genuinely could've continued training. By the time Videl rolls around, she's *way* too far behind everyone else. Even Yamcha has been in tons of battles whereas Videl is pretty green despite her great potential for a human. I thought it made sense for her to settle down and not be involved with the sheer insanity that the gang stumbles into."
SquaredCircle,"They've done some stuff but it's actually been funny and light-hearted, only done on occasions. A Sixers fan put his headband over his eyes and a Celtics fan brought out a broom when the Sixers were about to be swept. 

I think it helps that you barely see the fans while the game is going on due to the camera perspective. There's also this weird fascination with wrestling fans wanting to be part of the show."
nba,That was against the Nets.
nba,This is both despicable and fucking hilarious. I lost it at the Judgement Free Zone sign.
SquaredCircle,"It's her booking, it's pretty much the same thing that's happened with Roman. By all accounts, they're both very nice people and well liked by their peers but the way they're booked irks some fans and they take it out on them. It's not fair to them since they're not at fault."
nba,He almost had 50 in 2014 but missed a last second free throw.
movies,I thought the same thing!
dragonball,"What the...brain fart, thanks for pointing it out."
dragonball,"No, he really is that fucking lazy. Beerus is over a hundred million years old, he enjoys the status of his job but doesn't actually enjoy doing it. He's set on his ways and it seems not even avoiding erasure was enough to get him to be more competent."
dragonball,"Before this arc, it was Buu but Moro's giving him a run for his money. It's honestly why I don't like Moro much because he just pulls tricks out his ass and he feels more like a collection of gimmicks rather than a genuinely interesting character. When he literally swallowed Seven-Three, that did it for me."
dragonball,"> Titles such as One Piece, Demon Slayer, My Hero Academia, even Naruto all are works that resonate with its viewers on such a personal level that they deliberately evoke emotions from the viewers which is something Dragon Ball Super has never done.

I was talking with a friend about that and I think it's due to Dragon Ball being around for so long that the characters have improved in terms of power so much that it's hard to relate to them anymore. We have Goku literally matching the Destroyers now with MUI! Not only that but Goku is friends with the highest deities in the universe and even is besties with the actual supreme being of the DB multiverse so he has some extremely powerful allies that help him deal with situations whether it be directly or via training.

I don't think this is Super's fault as much as it is that powers have escalated to this point."
dragonball,"> They’re not brothers in the sense they had a single mom or dad. They’re from parallel universes so they mirror each other. 

That's not what either the show or manga have said; both have said they're twins, as in identical twins. It's never been implied they're mirror counterparts."
dragonball,"I don't think so, we've seen what SSJ3 does to a living body so I can't imagine what an actual SSJ4 would do. It's kind of implied that SSJ3 is what a saiyan can normally withstand without using God Ki or possessing the LSSJ gene. I actually like Goku, Vegeta and Gohan having to use different methods to achieve greater power.

(There's also Trunks SSJ Rage thing but we still have no idea WTF that is)"
dragonball,"No idea. We only know Goku's stronger than Belmod since Jiren was stronger than him. The manga pretty much confirms Beerus is among the strongest of the GoDs as he temporarily held his own against *all* of them and was the last one standing alongside Quitela.

So far, we've only gotten hints that Vegito, Gogeta, MUI Goku, Broly and Jiren (even though he's from U11, I wanted to include him) *might* be stronger than Beerus but there's been no direct confirmation. The only statement we've gotten from Beerus himself came from marketing material that said UI Goku might've surpassed him.

I reckon that current MUI is....going to make Beerus *very* nervous. Really excited to see the next chapter! In addition, I believe both fusions are stronger than Beerus since fusions have an absolutely absurd multiplier. *Base* Gogeta was stronger than Goku and Vegeta in SSJB!"
dragonball,"He's definitely not a pushover, it just seems he just tolerates the gang because of Earth's food and he seems to like their company."
dragonball,Super showed he can't stay indefinitely and he probably wants them to get it over with because it can be uncomfortable for him.
TropicalWeather,"Lived in Puerto Rico during that time, I can relate to this...."
dbz,"I posted a similar comment. Merus was set on his ways and Whis saw that so he wasn't going to intervene. He's respecting Merus wishes as Merus willingly helped despite knowing what was going to happen. 

This also lets Whis have plausible deniability with helping out Goku and the gang. I think the manga's showing that Whis does care but he has to remain neutral about things so he can't help as much as he'd like but since Merus willingly wants to help, this is a way of Whis helping out."
dbz,"> I don’t understand the people who say, “why should Goku care that Merus is gone?” 

I think it's because the manga goes at such a rapid pace that they forget Goku and Merus spent months training together, enough so that there's a bond to be established. I expect the anime to flesh this out more."
dbz,Whis might've just annoyed him a bit just to see how strong he is. He's technically helping the gang but he's also not directly doing it since he's just testing Broly out.
dbz,Holy shit....that'd be a fucking awesome idea! My eyebrows shot up through the roof.
dragonball,"I actually enjoyed that because it showed Goku kept his humanity despite being consumed by rage. For a few seconds, Goku really wasn't himself after his transformation. He had never gotten that angry before and he still hasn't reached that point ever again."
dragonball,"Dyspo's not part of their race, though. Beerus and Champa resemble cats whereas Dyspo resembles a rabbit. It can be assumed that whatever race Beerus and Champa belong to are already extinct since they're hundreds of millions of years old."
dragonball,Manga said he's #1 so I'm inclined to believe it's the same in the anime. Only beings I can see being at that level are Zeno's attendants.
dragonball,"> And man i must say that whis is really cold hearted

I honestly think this arc has shown the opposite of that, had Whis been cold he wouldn't have intervened with Meerus in the first place. and he sure as hell wouldn't have let Meerus stay to fight Moro. You think something like that would've slipped Whis' mind? I think he let him stay because he knew Meerus wanted this and he respected it. 

He still has to maintain his neutral stance due to his very existence being on the line if he takes too much action. Let's not forget that he was shown, at various times, to be very anxious and involved with U7's performance in the TOP. He's very proud of Goku and Vegeta's improvements and he definitely enjoys the others company beyond stuffing his stomach. I wouldn't say he'd get sentimental or too sad if the gang lost their lives but he'd definitely prefer to keep their company.

I think that's another reason he let Meerus help as much as he did...because, in a way, it let's him directly help Goku and the gang without him having to risk his existence. Now, I'm not saying he sacrificed Meerus so he wouldn't get erased or something, but he wasn't going to get in Meerus' way."
nba,That's the shit that makes me cast skepticism over the entire police force in this country. Consider how much insane shit we've seen thanks to bodycams and cellphone footage and now remember that those are new things. What's happened before that? I don't even want to think what crap they've gotten away with.
dragonball,"That might've been something Toriyama was explicit and direct in including in this chapter. I've always sensed he's bothered by how people view Goku as a hero when he's something more simple and, quite frankly, shallow than that.

Goku flat out saying ""You're giving me too much credit, man"" was pretty fucking explicit."
dragonball,"1) Angels are so fucking OP, Meerus is laughably weak compared to other Angels yet he just casually dominates Moro, someone who at his current strength is beyond UI Sign.

2) This is the clearest indication of how Goku's not really a hero, he just so happens to fight villains because they're strong. It seems this might awaken some form of justice within him, making him care beyond the next fight.

3) MUI should be interesting....hopefully, Goku can keep it without his body giving out on him and we might see if he really is at Beerus' level.

4) Moro's design really sucks now, he just looks like Cell. His goat design was really unique."
nba,"No doubt and it's funny hearing Melo cuss up a storm. I did find Pau Gasol's constant yelling to be distracting, though. Once I noticed it, I couldn't stop hearing it when I saw him play. Dude screams *loud*."
dragonball,"Knocked Kefla out, someone who only Jiren himself would've been able to eliminate."
dragonball,"> Vegeta isn't considered a good moment until he defeats the big bad all by himself, regardless of any character development.

Honestly, this is where Vegeta's strength as a character lies: it's not with him being the one to beat the main baddie, it's about him still atoning for his past and trying to become a better person. Vegeta's arguably gotten the best treatment in Super thus far."
dragonball,"To be fair, Goku's penchant for being the hero is mostly from the early part of the manga and the DBZ movies. Goku actually has a surprisingly bad track record:

1) Kills himself to kill Radditz

2) Vegeta kicks his ass pretty bad, they only win due to sheer luck

3) Beats Frieza pretty bad even if he doesn't kill him but he still won.

4) Gohan kills Cell

5) Defeats Buu with the help of everyone with a Genki Dama

6) Beerus toys with him and spares him mostly due to Earth's food and Beerus finding Goku interesting

7) Majorly fucks up with Frieza's return, Whis bailed him and everyone out

8) Doesn't defeat Hit due to his body crapping out on him

9) Zamasu gets defeated by Trunks with bullshit (not a fan of how that ended)

10) It takes a team effort to beat Jiren since Goku's body, yet again, crapped out on him

So ever since Radditz came to Earth, his only definite win was against Frieza."
dragonball,"That's something I see users here struggle with. We all love DB for a good chunk of our lives and while we've grown up, the basic essence of DB has not. It's still lighthearted and quite a simple story: Goku finding ways to overcome new enemies. If people expect more than that, they're just going to end up disappointed. 

Take Jiren for example. People were speculating he had a reason for being so strong and silent but the most simple solution turned out to be the correct one: he's just a strong dude."
dragonball,"In general, arcs don't have many consequences on the overall story. Hell, Frieza blew up the fucking planet and Whis just said ""Nope"" to that. We just had a tournament where *trillions* of people were erased and 17 undid that in 10 seconds.

It's still a show aimed at kids and it's still pretty lighthearted at its core. I've learned not to expect sophisticated storytelling, I just go along for the ride."
nba,"""True heights""

dragonball,"But she didn't match SSJ2 Goku, she matched a severely exhausted SSJ2 Goku."
SquaredCircle,"And he *sold* his own move. Everytime he hit it, he took a few seconds to sell the fact that the move hurts him too. Really sold how nuts he was at times."
SquaredCircle,"> The world titles meant nothing really

Still baffles me that both world title matches were the same. I understand Goldberg but Lesnar can fucking go, why make it a finisher spamfest?"
TropicalWeather,"Holy crap, that's horrible. Hurricanes are just something else."
SquaredCircle,I think them being smaller than Hulk helped them avoid having as many issues as Hogan currently has despite them working harder.
dragonball,"Regen had lost it's shock factor by the time Buu came along because the fucker abused the hell out of it. Piccolo couldn't do it that much without it draining him and Cell had superior regeneration abilities but it worked for the story. I didn't have a problem with it until Buu came along.

I think a big reason why Frieza was so effective is because he didn't rely on gimmicks, he's just absurdly powerful. That's why I don't like Moro because he's pretty much all gimmicks."
SquaredCircle,I think the white one looks better if you put them side-by-side but the black one just *feels* more prestigious for some reason. I think it's because it looks like a world title at first glance.
SquaredCircle,"Because you're saying WWE's track record of keeping top guys is bad but lump Cena in there with Rock, Austin and Brock, who left after only a few years. Austin was a time bomb with his injuries, Rock left because of Hollywood and Brock just hated the traveling. Cena left because it was his time to step out of the top spot and maintain his health by doing other things."
SquaredCircle,After like 13 years at the top. He's had the longest run out of any top guy in WWF/E history and one of the longest overall.
SquaredCircle,Very unfair to lump Cena in there. He left after more than a decade at the top.
thanosdidnothingwrong,The MCU hasn't really shown his power increasing that drastically with his anger. Both him and Thor are pretty underpowered compared to the shit they do on a routine basis in the comics.
dragonball,"> I don't know if Hell is where he'll go, but I imagine he wouldn't.

Considering how the two highest deities in Universe 7 (Shin and Beerus) have personally seen him commit actions that have benefited billions/trillions of lives, I reckon they'd step in and personally tell (or threaten in Beerus' case) Yemma to not judge him. That's if Yemma judges him but I actually think he won't since he's also witnessed what Vegeta's done  to help others.

Hell, this is the same guy that reincarnated Buu just because he overheard Goku saying he'd like to meet him again someday and actually lets Frieza come back to life for 24 hours for the TOP. Both of them are several layers worse than Vegeta ever was."
nba,"Not true, both Unseld and Westbrook did it. They also had a perfect triple-double whereas Jokic missed one free throw.

nba,That's something that's always struck me about MJ. He's arguably the king of advanced stats despite his game being way before even the most basic advanced stat was popularized.
nba,"Because despite the fast pace, the game was less taxing on the body due to lack of ball movement and the game being less physical. It was *really* easy to get called for fouls back. Wilt was the one who averaged the most minutes but players like Russell and Oscar regularly averaged way over 40 minutes per game, too."
nba,"> Also remember he pulled a vlad move before vlad by drafting Darko over Wade and Melo

Only in hindsight, Darko was seen as a very promising player and many other teams would've done the same. Vlade doesn't get the luxury of that excuse, I think it was the consensus that Luke was seen as a sure thing since he was the best player in the second best league in the world as a *teenager*."
nba,"Taking Darko at 2 was seen as the best decision to take so I wouldn't hold that against him. After he traded Billups, tho....things went off a cliff."
dragonball,Vegito stomps. I think people underestimate how much of a massive multiplier fusion grants. *Base* Gogeta is much stronger than both Goku and Vegeta in their Blue forms.
dragonball,"But that's the manga and things can be wildly different there. Blue's portrayed as having a *massive* energy strain comparable to SSJ3 whereas in the anime, it's mentioned as draining quite a bit of energy but it's never been portrayed as anything significant."
nba,It's exciting to see them play without KD since they're I find them much more enjoyable that way. I just hope both Steph and Klay have been able to fully recover.
dragonball,Dark times...the first 25-ish eps of Super were pretty rough and I genuinely thought it wasn't a good show. Things *really* picked up duruing the U6 vs U7 arc
nba,He got close a few times last year with  two 58 and two 57 point games last year. One of them was Miami and he missed a three that would've gotten him 61.

nba,"> It's honestly shocking that media outlets haven't picked up on the game they've been running since Newt was Speaker.

I'm certain they know about it but their desire to appear impartial outweights that. IMO, when you try to be impartial, all you do is help out the people with a horrendous viewpoint by giving them a voice."
dragonball,"Nah, SSG makes SSJ3 both irrelevant and impractical since it consumes *way* more stamina than God while being drastically inferior. The drain's just too much for it to be of any particular use. If he finds an opponent that's stronger than SSJ2, it's better for him to go straight to SSG or Blue instead of tiring himself out with SSJ3.

I think Goku actually likes the form and that's why he still brings it out every now and then if he has the luxury of time on his side and the stakes are low. It's noteworthy that besides his first fight with Beerus, Goku's never actually used SSJ3 in a serious fight. He used it against Trunks to quickly finish the fight and against Caulifla and Kale to get them off him. I think he only whips it out nowadays to show off."
nba,I think the media has an outsized worry about appearing partial to a certain ideology or party so they will mostly give equal weight and time to opposing viewpoints even if one of them is moronic. It's a big reason why Republicans are able to get away with so much BS.
nba,"It took me a while to actually make up to my mind if I wanted to watch it or not because of how painful it can be to hear him for more than a minute but I'm glad I did, Swan really didn't let him spew his usual empty bullshit soundbites and made him actually look even dumber than he usually comes off as. Trump can't deal when someone actually pushes back."

SquaredCircle,This is probably the best work of his career. It's getting to the point where I want him to take the title off Drew so Drew will go insane and absolutely destroy him to get it back.

SquaredCircle,Really says how good 2000 was when barely anybody complains about that Mania since the rest of the year was so awesome. Definitely WWE's best year.
SquaredCircle,"Problem is that even if it wasn't being forced by having someone have 10 straight opponents that would genuinely make sense for the wrestler to go over on, people would already be on the lookout the moment for a new streak when they go 4-0.

To this day, I'm not sure if it was the right call to have The Streak end. It made for one hell of a moment but I always felt they had one huge money match that they never did: Taker vs Cena at WM in an I Quit Match."
SquaredCircle,"What really bothered me was how many people here were defending it.

""It makes sense! Just wait and see what happens next!""

Absolutely jack shit happened next. Asuka's undefeated streak was treated like a footnote. Why the hell would you build up an undefeated streak for over 2 years (or however long it was) and end it at the *first* chance she gets at a title?

It'd make more sense to have her win and go on a warpath until someone finally beats her."
SquaredCircle,"Really helps that Keith Lee got a *huge* rub from Lesnar in the Royal Rumble. Lesnar was already impressed by him walking to the ring and for people who don't know who Lee is, just seeing Lesnar immediately react makes the audience know he's a big deal."

nba,People will look at Nash's numbers and wonder what the big deal was and how he got 2 MVP's but I'd argue only Magic was better at managing an offense. Those Suns teams were *way* ahead of their time and they're definitely the most influential team since the start of the century.

nba,What really disturbed me was how....Trumpian he sounded. Not only what he said but what reports said about his conduct behind the scenes. I'm not saying he's a horrendous person but rather that he seemed to be unwilling to actually do the job and instead thought his innate charisma was going to be enough.
nba,"For as much of a troll as Skip is, he's never really genuinely insulted athletes like Cowherd did with John Wall and what he said about his father or when he talked shit about Eddie Guerrero's death, saying insensitive remarks that he died due to steroid use and questioning why his death was news."
dragonball,"> He was even able to keep up and beat Moro in he’s powered up form when UI Omen Goku stalemated him.

Wasn't that more due to Vegeta's spirit technique? I see too many people outright saying that Vegeta's SSBE is superior to UI Sign because of this but Moro wasn't sweating against him but due to him casually blocking Vegeta's attack, he was unknowingly losing energy."
nba,"Man, I'm so happy to see Porzingis bounce back from his ACL injury and shake off that rust. You could tell he wasn't himself at the beginning of the year but since 2020 started, he's been killing it.

SquaredCircle,"Honestly, The Rock's kinda unique in that regard for me because I never really thought of him as being from one race or another, he was just this awesome dude. I chalk that up to me being more naive as a kid and not knowing much about race during his peak."

SquaredCircle,"> To make a living they seeked out jobs where they could spend all day in their underpants writing pretentious histrionic articles about their childhood hobbies. They're like smarks, except with degrees, their own apartments, bank accounts, and social skills. 

I look at it as a way of trying to artificially elevate video games into a higher art form like movies or music are sometimes looked at. I just find that hard to swallow since games are mostly meant to entertain above anything else and it's interactive nature makes it hard to convey emotions in a way that's both engaging and fun.

Like...even though I feel miserable watching a movie like Requiem for a Dream, I can still do so because a movie doesn't have to be ""fun"" in order to enjoy it whereas playing a game that has an equally miserable storyline would be hard to enjoy if the game isn't fun. RDR2 was like that for me: I could recognize how wonderful the story is but the game wasn't fun enough for me to make me want to play more."

I hope it's clear by now that ex-NBA players, even legendary ones, don't necessarily make good executives. It seems the most successful ones are the ones that weren't star players, same with coaches. Interestingly, Bird's a notable exception on both fronts: he was both a successful coach and a successful executive."

dragonball,"> He definitely could’ve done what Trunks did and gotten rid of his physical body. Imo they way under scaled what Vegito’s Final Kamehameha should’ve done and made it so Zamasu could keep up with him just so that Trunks could do his spirit sword asspull

That whole arc was filled with weird power scaling things. Vegito's Final Kamehameha doing no damage to Zamasu is overshadowed by *Goku* almost KILLING him a few minutes before with a standard Kamehameha. IMO, they should've shown Goku pulling out a Blue KKx20 just for that moment and that would've made more sense."
dragonball,"> There was no good reason whatsoever to not simply use Gogeta in that arc. In fact, I think it would have been all the more beneficial to the themes of the story for a haughty Fusion of two gods via a godly Fusion method to get his face ground into the dirt by a pair of mortals using a mortal Fusion method.

....damn, that would've been beautiful."
dragonball,"> But even in the silly Super Dragon Ball Heroes show, Vegito using Blue Kaioken x20 struggles against arc-boss-turned-henchmen-baddy Cumber, while Gogeta Blue with no new power ups can defeat actual-arc-boss Hearts.
> 
> Seriously writers wtf.

Hence why nobody takes Heroes seriously, it's horrendously written. It's just for promotional purposes."
dragonball,"> As for showings in the anime, I feel like Vegito doesn't take things as serious as Gogeta. Hence why I think Vegito's showing against Zamasu in the anime wasn't as dominant as Gogeta in the Broly movie.

Kinda unfair to Vegito as he clearly was provoking Buu into absorbing him the first time and was purposely being a dick to him. Against Zamasu, he was still a dick but he wasn't toying with him. He was about to kill him but the Potara wore off due to Blue's immense power. Had he known about that limit, pretty sure he would've killed him in 5 minutes.

IMO, his showing against Zamasu was closer to his true personality. We really didn't see much of it against Buu."
dragonball,"> Maybe because shenron wouldn't be able to grant it, didn't Zamasu have to gather the super dragon balls for it?

Because there's no Shenron in U11. I think it's implied that the dragon balls in U7 are unique to it."
dragonball,"I think so, Gogeta wasn't underestimating Broly but he wasn't going all out because he didn't need to and, in my opinion, he didn't go Blue from the start because he wanted to see if Broly showed even greater power. That way, he can be sure Broly had nothing else to surprise him with. 

I don't think he was wasting time as he clearly wasn't giving Broly a break to even breath and he kept mercilessly assaulting him. Hell, he even smirked at times. The only time he eased off was when he was about to kill him."
dragonball,"It really depends on whether Jiren knows of Moro's abilities beforehand. Excluding deities, Jiren's the only one who can go toe-to-toe with UI Goku once he surpassed his limits. I seriously doubt Moro can do shit to UI Goku so the same applies to Jiren at full power."
nba,Maybe that smirk *is* cause for concern.
dragonball,"Yes, I get what you mean but the difference is Goku wouldn't have suffered from those effects since his body would've powered down by itself out of sheer exhaustion whereas Vegito *wouldn't* have been able to power down no matter what."
politics,"That's my first though. Obama used this as an opportunity to further elaborate and advance the cause that Lewis himself has been advocating since before most of us were born. Like...if there's a Heaven and Lewis is watching this, his face would cramp up from smiling so much."
dragonball,"It's theoretically possible but highly unlikely. The strain from SSJ3 is too much compared to SSJ for the same principles to be applied. SSJ never really showed any short-term problems regarding stamina whereas Goku gets winded after only a few minutes for SSJ3. By the time Super comes, you barely see Goku use SSJ3 because of how impractical it was, he mostly uses it to show off now. He either uses SSJ or SSJ2 whenever he wants to gauge how strong someone is.

Anyways, it's a moot point since SSJG and Blue are a thing and they both are a *gigantic* leap in power from SSJ3 while having none of the stamina issues (at least in the anime, the manga presents Blue in a similar light to SSJ3 in terms of strain)."
dragonball,"> The only other person who has learned SSJ3 is Gotenks, but Gotenks is a fusion so stamina and ki usage probably work quite differently for him.

He probably has similar issues but the fusion runs out before it affects his performance."
dragonball,"He was referring to Vegito not being able to power down if they fused as SSJs. Vegito was absurdly powerful but eventually, the strain of keeping the form for months/years would've caught up to him."
dragonball,I remember when I first saw that panel and almost died at the sheer absurdity of Toriyama popping up out of nowhere and breaking the fourth wall.
TropicalWeather,"It's something that I find some dark humor in after having processed what happened. PR got lucky and dodged a historically powerful hurricane only to then get directly hit by *another* historically powerful hurricane. It's like Mother Nature missed it's first shot and was like, ""Nah, you're not getting off that easily.""

I remember my dread slowly building up as Irma's updates kept increasing it's wind speed until it reached 185mph. The relief I felt was immense after everything settled down but when I got power back a week later, I logged into this sub and what do I see? The low that eventually became Maria. Unlike Irma, there was no hope we were going to be lucky. With Irma, forecasts were debating whether we would get hit or dodge it but that wasn't the case with Maria, forecasts had it hitting us...it was just a matter of where.

What really gives me chills is thinking what would've happened had Irma actually hit us and then María came by 2 weeks later...it's something I try not to think about too much."
TropicalWeather,"> And your point is spot on with Katrina, except for one thing I’d add: The eye of Katrina didn’t pass over Orleans pariah. Exactly 1 major hurricane has passed directly over Orleans Parish: Cat 3 Isidore, over the east side of the Parish.

That's right, people forget Katrina didn't make landfall in New Orleans, they just got the worst damage due to the levees failing. 

As amazing as it sounds, Katrina could've somehow had been even worse had it maintained it's peak strength *and* directly hit New Orleans."
TropicalWeather,"> People get fixated on the worst storm they remember, and that becomes the standard. So if it was a cat 5 where the center was 200 miles away, they’ll see a cat 3 eye projected to move over their roof and think “well I survive a cat 5!” No, that’s not relevant.

This was really evident to me when Irma passed by PR at it's peak. Winds were at 180 (though it was reported at 185 at the time) and the eye was like 40-50 miles from me in San Juan. At worst, we got low-end Cat 2 winds. 2 weeks later, Maria came by at a similar intensity but it came from a lower angle and.....you know the rest."
politics,They pretty much made Cuomo a potential future POTUS candidate.
SquaredCircle,First name that popped in my mind.
Gundam,Unicorn as a show was also a slog for me since the story was all over the place. I enjoyed it because of the incredible animation and spectacular battles. It's like 0083 in that regard although 0083 is easier to watch.
nba,They're better than their record suggests since Sheed was traded mid-season to them and that's when they became the best defensive team of all time.
SquaredCircle,"It's one thing to do it at the biggest show of the year, it's another to do it at every damn PPV."
nba,There's also the fact that the Knicks were physical as all hell. Hard to be fond of someone who will knock your ass to the ground.
nba,Because he routinely went against him and the Knicks.
nba,"Because Hakeem was his only peer that was truly at his level and he usually gave his Chicago teams problems, he truly and genuinely respect him as a player. I honestly think that deep down, he was the only player he didn't want to go against.

Also, he was a Center so he never really went against him."
nba,"> Wilt has 80 games with 10 or more assists compared to Jokic's 20

What? First of all, you're comparing Wilt's entire career to Jokic's 5 seasons. Secondly, Jokic has 51 games with 10 or more assists. I can't use BBall-Ref's stat finder anymore but I counted them by browsing each of his seasons. Dude already has 40 triple doubles so he clearly has at least 40 games with 10 assists. 

Wilt was never lauded as a good passer and he was criticized for merely waiting for a teammate to be open instead of creating a shot for them. It's also the first time I've ever heard anyone say he was the best outlet passer ever, it's usually either Russell or Unseld who gets that mention, with Jokic now catching up to them.

Raw assists numbers don't always tell the story about the quality of passes a player is making."
nba,What still gets me is how dismayed he is at getting his jacket ruined with white paint.
dragonball,"Where are you getting that Angels get their power from living beings? The only thing we know about their power is that it's absurdly high, to the point that nobody will ever touch them, and that they all know UI."
nba,"Fauci has said that while the process is being done faster than normal, they're not going to push a rushed vaccine. What companies are mainly doing is producing stockpiles of vaccines that show promise *way* before they get results from trials back. They're basically making gambles on those vaccines coming up with little-to-mild side effects.

Normally they wouldn't do this because it means losing money if the vaccine doesn't pan out but since they're receiving more funding that ever before, they can do this."
nba,"> As an aside, for those thinking Muggsy couldn’t handle being called a midget, I’d recommend reading The Boys of Dunbar to get a better feel for what Muggsy’s been through over the course of his life.

I haven't read the book but you don't get to the NBA at 5'3'' if you let shit like that get to you. He probably loved when people talked trash to him cause he could quickly shut them up with his absurd skills.

Fun fact: NBA players *hated* when Muggsy guarded them since he was so small and quick. Players aren't used to such a small guy getting right up in their dribble."
SquaredCircle,"I don't understand, what's that got to do with business? Investors don't care who's running creative as long as the money keeps coming."
SquaredCircle,"> Vince and Trump share a lot of similarities, but I think Vince isn’t quite as good a snake oil salesman. 

For all his faults, Vince has delivered on the business side of things and doesn't depend of getting bailed out by banks. He doesn't need to bullshit investors because he gets results."
politics,"I think so, I doubt Chuck's going to forget how the GOP blatantly stole a Supreme Court seat. He can't play by the normal rules, you have to get dirty."
politics,You've posted like 4 times talking about exit polls vs official results yet you've yet to provide a link showing the discrepancy.
nba,"He was clearly their best player in the 06-07 and 07-08 seasons. Before that, it was either him or Ben."
nba,Dark times for the Center position.
nba,"> Rob Hennigan was hired as the youngest GM in the NBA, at 30 years old.

Why did the Magic hire such a young and inexperienced guy? A good GM needs to have both good connections and a keen business sense: did he shows signs of either?"
nba,"While I get annoyed by how much people complain about those being travels when they're clearly not, I do think it gives offensive players way too much of a benefit."
nba,"It's comical how insane he was at getting offensive rebounds. You can tell how overwhelming he was on that end from watching tape: dude was fucking relentless. I get exhausted just watching him chase all those boards, I can't imagine how it felt playing against him. Like...you're only purpose is to get this guy off the glass but you just *can't* stop him."
nba,I wonder how Kareem felt playing against him. Kareem was more of a finesse player whereas Moses would just push you all over the floor with his gigantic ass.
nba,That always blows my mind. Here's an extremely young prospect and he's getting mentored by the best Center in the game.
nba,I never understood why he didn't play in the NBA.
nba,I can see how that could be a problem: his mind's the same but the body isn't. He could really injure himself going all out once his competitive juices take over.
nba,"You know, I think I finally let myself have hope that the season would finish when I read that Fauci himself approved the plan."
nba,"> The one thing the NHL did much better than the NBA is they are bubbling in cities in Canada, not Florida.

Unfair, the plans were pretty much set in stone when cases started going back up. Silver and the NBA had no way of knowing DeathSentance was going to fuck things up. By the time cases were spiking to record levels, it was too late to change venue."
SquaredCircle,Didn't he go out of his way to say that he loved working with Kane cause he was easy to work with and is extremely safe in the ring?
