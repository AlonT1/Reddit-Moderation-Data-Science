Games,"We typically don't lock threads after removing but we still think this is a worthwhile (and very relevant) discussion to be having. We wanted to highlight that through a megathread while consolidating updates to it for a little bit, since there seems to be constant new developments and viewpoints regarding the situation, while allowing for existing discussions to take place when we redirect new updates to the megathread."
Games,Fair point. I'm adding a link to this discussion thread now in the megathread.
AmItheAsshole,"Meanwhile, I'm deaf and have been since birth but I have a cochlear implant. I'm relatively mainstream so I don't consider myself Deaf."
marvelstudios,"We got like, one dude talking about his dead husband at a group meeting. Thirty seconds of LGBT rep, whoo! Totally what we wanted. *sigh*"
Games,"I tend to view 'woke brands' as a litmus test of society in general. Think of it this way: companies are really good at market research and they know their demographics. If they think catering to non-racists is more profitable than racists, they will do so. 

You can see an example of this through the growing trend of 'Pride' merchandise and support from corporations each year: if companies think that catering and 'pandering' to the LGBT community and allies is more profitable than retaining homophobic shoppers, they will show that... and that means society in general has become more accepting of LGBT people in the long run."
ModSupport,It seems they've been unsuspended. Thank you for the quick response! Can I please ask why he was suspended in the first place and what led to the denial of his appeal?
Games,What games in particular inspired Cris Tales?

Games,"I checked and it seems to look for just threads in /r/games even without the operator. This is on Old Reddit though.

However, it seems you're using the New Reddit so maybe the search breaks, because there's no 'limit to subreddit' tickbox on the New Reddit's search when it's ticked on by default when using Old Reddit. 

I'll edit the links in a bit to include that operator for New Reddit. Thanks for letting me know!"
ModSupport,"Are y'all so *completely inept* in providing advance notice to the moderators after constantly promising that you would do so before enacting site-wide changes like this, even on a temporary basis? This is ridiculous, y'all are ridiculous, it is no wonder why moderators will always have good reasons to not trust admins when you keep providing them."
Games,"I'm sorry that you're upset about the removal of your comments. However, we do strive for quality discussion and that means nipping short replies from the discussion entirely. This encourages people to put more thought into their comments and improves the potential discussion in the long run. Comments like ""lol"", ""k"", and ""geraldo good"" do not make for a lively discussion, in my opinion, and I believe many of our users would agree with that. There are other spaces in Reddit for that. 

We also don't want to leave replies for every low-effort comment that is automatically removed: there would be a substantial amount, enough that it can outweigh any discussion that would take place in the comments. Thank you for reaching out and have a wonderful day."
Games,Howdy Vlane! Thank you for bringing that up. I don't have a solid answer for you right now but we're discussing this internally. Hopefully we come up with a change that everyone finds amenable but no promises! Have a wonderful evening.
Games,"Going ""gold"" is bit of a misnomer these days, actually. It just means the game is complete enough to create a ""master disc"" so they can start production of physical copies. However, they will still continue to work on a Day 1 patch and have it ready to push out by release day, since the completed game will still have issues. As games get larger and more complex, there'll be more bugs and they need more time beyond ""going gold"" to ready them for actual players. 

And before you say, ""They just need more QA"", consider this: they could have a department of 200 just playtesting the game for a solid year to squash any bugs but their collective playtime would be absolutely dwarfed by the amount of playtime players get on just Day 1. 

It seems like I'm focusing on a small aspect of your comment, however. I just wanted to give you some insight into gaming development which I've acquired through my time reading this subreddit. :) 

Also, there's a good reason we're 1/10 the userbase of gaming. That's because /r/gaming was originally a default sub and therefore, their usercount automatically went up with every new account. Furthermore, /r/games does not show up in /r/all. As a result, our growth is a slower than most subreddits. 

We have several examples of what to post in this subreddit so I'm a little unsure about your confusion on this. On the sidebar, we have some items under 'Allowed Submissions' in the green box. They are as follows: News and articles, Reviews and previews, Informative self-posts, Questions likely to generate discussion. 

We also provide further examples in the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules) page which is linked right below that box. On the top of that page, we elaborate further on the allowed submissions. Then if you look in Section 7, we have a link to examples of [quality posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/quality_discussion) that we use as examples of what we'd like to see in this subreddit. However, I do think we can make this clearer so I'll be asking if we can put this up top of the Rules page and perhaps somewhere on the sidebar.

However, I'm sorry that the subreddit is not meeting your needs at the meantime. Sometimes a community isn't just right for everyone and I highly encourage you to evaluate other subreddits to see if they meet your needs. We link to quite a few on the sidebar as well, under 'Other Subreddits'. Can I suggest /r/truegaming? 

In any case, thank you for your feedback! It's greatly appreciated."

Libraries,Do you have any articles or literature for further reading? I'd be greatly interested in seeing some because this sounds like something I'd love to develop into a workshop concerning bias in academia.

Games,"**Spiritfarer** is a really cute game, relatively short (about 25 hours to complete with some stuff left undone), but it's a wonderful palate cleanser especially if you want to take a break from another game like me. (I have 100+ hours in Xenoblade Chronicles 2, with a chunk of the game to go...)

The game loop is essentially that you bring aboard spirits, aid them with their final requests, build up your boat with different facilities, and improve your ship as you sail around fishin', gardenin', smithin', etc. It's a very relaxing game with a cute art style. The narrative is a little shallow but the characters have some depth. I don't regret picking this up at all."

For example, [Frogwares spoke](http://frogwares.com/official-statement-on-removal-of-our-games-from-storefronts-by-focus-home-interactive/) about how Focus took down some of their games and refused to transfer them to Frogwares."
Games,"I would argue that the EO wasn't that clear in making this distinction, which gave people pause. I've already edited my comment to reflect this new tweet before you responded. Thank you!"
Games,Time is a manmade construct and is utterly meaningless. (Thanks!)
Games,Fixed! Thanks!
Games,Thanks for the input! I was in the process of editing it as such. I hope that's clearer now.
Games,"UPDATE: So apparently, according to an official that spoke with LA Times, this EO only blocks transactions specifically to WeChat. The gaming companies listed below are arguably not affected. It really says something when an EO sparks this much confusion, in my opinion... [Source tweet](https://twitter.com/samaugustdean/status/1291576813685108736).

This has implications for the gaming industry. Riot Games, Epic Games, other companies that Tencent has some ownership in. If they can't take in money, people aren't getting paid... and this may further shake up the gaming industry.

Of course, this will probably go to court, get tied up long enough that it either doesn't matter or it gets overturned.

The issue is that some of the wording in the order complicates the matter. Section 1 (c) specifies that the government has 45 days to indicate which of Tencent’s subsidiaries would be subject to this ruling. There's no established metric in the EO for making that decision: it's up to the Secretary of Commerce.

Notably, Riot Games will be on vacation next week so that is something they'll have to contend with...

Tencent currently has some stakes in a large number of video game companies... 

* Full ownership of Riot Games (League of Legends, Valorant), Funcom (Age of Conan, Secret World), and Sharkmob. 
* Approximately 80% ownership of Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile) and Supercell (Clash of Clans).
* 40% of Epic Games (Fortnite, Unreal Engine)
* Notably, 5% in Activision Blizzard (World of Warcraft), Paradox Interactive (Stellaris), and Ubisoft (Assassin's Creed)
* 1.5% in Bluhole (PUBG)
* Capital investment in PlatinumGames (Bayonetta)
* Various stakes in Miniclip, Yager Development, Marvelous, Funplus, iDreamSky, Netmarble, Glu Mobile, Kakao Games and Frontier Developments."

Games,"For more details on what happened,[ here's a translated version](http://www.dulcamarra.net/2020/07/11/sexual-harassment-at-ubisoft-we-knew/) of an article from Libération, a French newspaper. It mentions Serge and issues stemming from HR's unwillingness to cooperate.

~~EDIT: Maybe don't celebrate just yet. Jason asked for clarity about the press release since it only mentions Hascoet and Cornet resigning but that Mallat is resigning and leaving the company. [Ubisoft responded that they have ""nothing further to share beyond the press release""](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1282099160896987136?s=20) so there's a possibility those two have not actually left the company.~~

EDIT2: I'm so glad to hear that writing a letter about the systematic sexual harassment and misconduct in their work culture solved the problem! Thank you all for letting me know. It's so clear that I was in the wrong here for calling them out. My bad.

EDIT3: [You know, this is why I think their letter means jack shit.](https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-employees-have-grave-concerns-over-toronto-stud-1844277486) They knew it was a problem for a *long* time and they act all surprised, like it's some brand new revelation.

ModSupport,"So, to summarize: 

Awards can animate and impede viewing of a comment, as indicated [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/g8qbw4/completely_disable_animations_and_stylization_of/). 

Users can abuse awards in specific situations, as indicated [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/ggu0kr/reward_abuse_in_reddit_posts_a_case_study/). Awards can also not fit the subreddit or post in which they were given, laid out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/fut93p/please_consider_giving_subs_the_ability_to/).

~~Furthermore, moderators can remove awards but both the receipent and award giver(s) will be notified of who took the action, indicated [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/ggu0kr/reward_abuse_in_reddit_posts_a_case_study/fq4r7oq/).~~ It seems that the wording of the notification is unclear and that the notification does not actually contain the username of the moderator who removes an award from the post. [This is further clarified in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/gjat2k/hide_inappropriate_awards_from_posts_or_comments/) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/gj3h05/now_getting_harassing_message_sent_through_reddit/fqjav7y/).

Admins seem to continually ignore or fail to follow up on these sort of posts so frankly, your post is no different. Consider your feedback given and then immediately shredded. I'm sorry you're having these issues but awards, abuse and all, are here to stay."

This has been an issue for a while now and the likely outcome is either: ""I'm sorry you feel this way, we'll take a look into this"" and nothing changes or they don't respond at all, shoving it under the rug until you go away.

I presume because Coyote messed with the humans, they began observing him and revering him, which gave him power through the ether. Meanwhile, Renard abstained, so he was never that powerful to begin with."

Games,"I've been playing this today! I learned about it a few months ago and remembered it when it came up my Twitter feed yesterday. It's pretty decent, with plenty of story between the puzzles. 

However, there's a few bugs that I hope the developers can iron out. For example, if I go out into the menu and then back in during a puzzle, the controls freeze which is pretty annoying. I have to load my last save to fix that. 

Otherwise, it's solid and I love the characters so far. It looks like it may be pretty short but I've only finished the first case so far and hopefully the later cases are a bit longer."

I can feel thunder, I can feel clanging pots while washing the dishes, I can feel my own voice when I stub my toe... but there's nothing after that.

ModSupport,"Some of them are stupid enough to use a similar username schemata and also comment the inane thing that got them banned in the first place. They are not wunderkinds, just increasingly persistent especially when a ban evasion report is submitted and we get it bounced back saying ""there's no connection"" which has happened a few times. This isn't the only reason why some mods may utilize a botban but it's a notable one."
ModSupport,"To clarify, a better term for shadowbans as used in this context would be ""botban"" - basically when we ask Automod to automatically remove any and all posts and comments from a specific user. They wouldn't show up as removed to the user and the user would be stuck posting in the void. It's a useful tool for handling trolls who'd just make a new account to evade a ban for whatever behavior got them banned in the first place. This way, they don't realize that they've been 'marked' for removal for a while... until y'all implemented this new change."

ModSupport,"Unfortunately, yes. Admins are routinely inconsistent in their handling of ban evading. I've had both accounts get nipped right away and accounts lingering long after a report. Your only resort is continually badgering the admins into taking more extreme action against the ban evader or... just waiting it out. 

I've had a ban evader continually post transphobic remarks under a new account before. Sometimes, the admins hit them with the banhammer, sometimes they don't. Eventually, they just went away but I'm pretty sure they'll be back any day now."

Games,Kudos for The Wicked and The Divine. I'm so sad the series is over but it was great while it lasted!
Games,I'm betting you had a copy of Bulfinch's Mythology when you were younger. ;)
Games,"So in one of your news posts that contains lore, there's a reference to 'Others', presumably gods from other pantheons. Is it possible that we'll see them in the game? I'd imagine this is spoilery! 

If you can't answer that then maybe: why did you settle on the Greek pantheon? Why not Egyptian or Norse?"
Games,Can you elaborate on that? What would have been the scenario and which game was this DLC for? I'd imagine you were setting this up in something like a musical episode in Buffy.

Games,"To be fair, both games have been heavily updated with patches and now have a somewhat different experience than they did at launch day. They're great games, through and through: they just needed more time in the oven, I think."
Games,"I am the sorriest detective ever. It's been an interesting playthrough, especially when I'm failing something important."
Games,"Hmmmm, I like it enough, but I backed it during the original fundraising campaign and I'm not quite sure if I got what I invested in. It's very pretty but seems... a little shallow."
Games,"Gosh darn it, I'm already tied up in Disco Elysium and Indivisible. Don't give me another good game right away... Couldn't they have waited for a few weeks? 

On a more serious note, I'm glad to see these scores. It seems like Obsidian finally had the time and resources to create an awesome game, one that I look forward to playing."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language."
Games,"I understand the issue. Unfortunately, a bot posts the removal comments for us and we explain why in [this post](https://redd.it/dbuwvu). Typically when a post is removed for Rule 4, especially if it's been reported for it, we search for any similar articles in search and have [the results sort by new](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/search?q=final+fantasy+7&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all). If we confirm a duplicate, we flair the post with Rule 4 and remove the post.

Sometimes later on, those original posts can get deleted by whoever posted them and it looks like there wasn't any duplicates when OP checks for it later, which can be frustrating since it happens often. In those cases, they're free to get in touch with us in modmail and let us know. We'll take a look and sometimes reinstate the post or allow OP to repost their removed post."
Games,"Discussing piracy itself is fine in the appropriate context: for example, how piracy affects games or how developers contend with piracy. However, endorsing it or encouraging it isn't allowed.

The rule itself reads as follows: 

> 5. No linking to or endorsing piracy as a solution - Digital piracy is the unauthorized use or reproduction of another's work, games or other. Enabling piracy by informing others how to circumvent the law, linking to it by providing access to pirated material, or general promotion, endorsement, or encouragement of piracy is not allowed. This includes links to scanned images of other copyrighted work, such as commercial magazines. News and discussion regarding emulators are allowed provided no copyrighted content is linked to. Discussion of piracy and its impact on the industry is allowed."
