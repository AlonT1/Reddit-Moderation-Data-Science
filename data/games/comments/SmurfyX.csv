SquaredCircle,"Here's the matches for tomorrow and what is up with each of them

Inner Circle Vs. Top Flight, Brandon Cutler, The Varsity Blondes, & Best Friends 


The Acclaimed Vs. SCU 


Hardy Party Vs. Page/Silver/Reynolds 


Cody Vs. Angelico


Deeb/Swole Vs. Ivelisse/Diamante


Kenny Omega Vs. Joey Janella No DQ (For Title Shot)


For that huge match-- Inner Circle is a group led by Chris Jericho who are experiencing some turbulence recently because Chris let in a guy, MJF, who is basically in it to blow it up. They wanted a big group match to prove they can still hang. They'll probably explode on each other... or maybe not! Hard to say.


The Acclaimed are a new heel tag team fighting the first tag team champs because the Acclaimed tried to pick a fight with the babyface tag team champs. They are looking to prove they can be a big league team. 


Hardy Party is Matt Hardy and his tag team proteges, private party. They've also been experiencing some issues lately because Matt Hardy seems to be losing his fucking mind and is turning full blown bad dude. Hangman Adam Page used to be tag team champs with current AEW World Champ Kenny Omega. Kenny and he broke up because of A LOT of reasons, and now Adam Page is being courted by the Dark Order. They are a cult, ostensibly an evil one but they're getting over so hard as good guys they might not be evil for long, or maybe they will. Hard to say. He's doing this trios match with two of the Dark Order guys as a one-off, but he miiiiight stick with them. It'll be fun to see.


Cody and Angelico-- no fucking idea. Cody used to be TNT champ and now is mad kind of because Sting isn't on Dynamite to be his best friend and help him be very cool. Why he's fighting Angelico, who the fuck knows. Angelico is part of a tag team called The Hybrid 2, and mostly they lose. 


The womens tag match-- no idea. The womens division on AEW is half pulling names out of a hat and half putting storylines on the youtube show. There's really no story behind this. 

Omega/Janella - These guys have fought twice on Dynamite/Dark and Janella said he wanted a third match. Janella is kind of known as a hardcore guy and Omega is the new champ and a huge insane sociopath thats out to win belts not only on Dynamite but on Impact, AAA, maybe NJPW, everywhere in the world. If Janella wins, he gets to challenge for the title. They don't have a lot of background together besides these matches."

These dudes from a DIFFERENT COMPANY show up and he gets disrespected in his own building? It like instantly makes him a huge babyface to me. Helped too he had an awesome, awesome match."

SquaredCircle,you doll
SquaredCircle,Honestly that was Kenny's best promo I've seen yet. He seemed authentic for once.
SquaredCircle,"Summary since OP isn't updated:


 * Impact opens with a short recap of the Moxley/Omega fight and finish. Throughout the show they remind us that they have AEW's champ in an RV outside of the IMPACT ZONE for an interview later. Matthews will lead the interview ""at SOME point during this show"" (AKA the end). They have a segment talking about how this breaks all the rules of modern wrestling. 

     * [Tony Khan and SKEEAVONE appear in a paid ad](https://twitter.com/IMPACTWRESTLING/status/1336480959412187136) on the show and talk about how disgraceful this act by Omega/Callis is, and TK issues a veiled threat to Don Callis. ""WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YA BUDDY."" Tony Khan says there are rumors he might buy Impact Wrestling. SKEEAVONE says it's been 25 years since he talked to Sting(?). During commercial breaks Impact is playing clips from AEW wrestlers from back when they were on their show. This is confusing the dregs of twitch chat despite it saying ""2009"" in gigantic font in the middle of the screen. What are you gonna do I guess. Tommy Dreamer is in a segment talking about how this is terrible for Impact's morale in the locker room. A guy I do not know the name of (Scott?) encourages him to try and sell a tshirt and stop whining. He says even Lance Storm likes this and Lance Storm hates everything. The Impact fans and AEW fans are clashing throughout the show on twitch chat until Impact runs the Steiner math promo during a commercial break at which time a temporary armistice was declared as everyone shouted ""CHANCES GO EVEN MORE DOWN"" over and over and over and over again. 


     * The Impact champ, Rich Swann, is blocked from accessing the parking lot because ""The Champion"" is in the parking lot. He says he IS the champion. The guy laughs and says, not you, the **AEW Champion**.  He is pissed. Matthews enters the RV to meet with Callis and Omega. Omega has the AEW belt front and center. Callis says he's going to show us history by changing the name plate to Omega on Impact. Callis removes Mox's plate while Matthews asks Kenny and Callis about how long they've been planning this. 

     * Callis hands Omega the Mox name plate. Omega tosses it away after calling Mox Ambrose and denigrating Matthews for working in WWE. Callis says he and Kenny have been planning this for 27 years. He says ever since Golden Sheik trained Callis and he introduced Callis to Kenny it's been planned.
 Callis has always looked after Kenny like Golden Sheik looked after him. He's been the invisible hand in Kenny's life always. Callis says, do you really think I came out of retirement to do a PODCAST, or color commentary for NJPW? It was always the plan. He says he played TK. Callis says wrestling people don't understand family like Callis and Kenny. He says he booked the Jericho Omega match, the match TK credits for AEW's creation. Callis says ""YOU'RE WELCOME"" for both. Callis says he and Kenny are changing history not once, but twice now. 

     * He says people are calling it ""The Golden Screwjob"" He doesn't see it as a screwjob, he says he's setting the course of history right. They did it together. They don't make matches, they make memories. WE MAKE HISTORY"". 

     * Matthews asks Omega if this tarnishes his legacy. Callis calls Matthews a worm. Matthews says isn't the win kind of tainted since Callis helped? Omega asks if Matthews has a father. Omega says what would you do if someone hurt your father? Would you not step up to defend them? Kenny says yes, there was a gentlemen's agreement, but Moxley violated it by laying hands on **the** invisible hand. Kenny says he's pissed at Matthews. He says he's got WWE's arrogance in him. Omega says he's had probably 17 of the top 20 matches in AEW. Top matches in England, Japan, Mexico, he's the best everywhere he goes. 

     * Kenny says, so he's here at Impact because he can be. He feels like the old him again. Kenny says he fancies himself a collector. It used to be comics, but now he's found something else to collect. He says he's got the AAA title already... maybe he wants the Impact title. Kenny says he wants to go around and collect some belts. 

     * He says you think the Lex Express was riding in style? He has something cooler. Kenny says he's gonna do the thing. ""Goodbye, and goodnight. BANG."" Callis calls Matthews a Stamford stooge. They say there'll be another announcement on Dynamite and dip out."
SquaredCircle,"I had fun watching this, I'm even more excited about the whole thing than I was before. I liked they wrapped in some of Impact's wrestlers."
SquaredCircle,I've enjoyed watching this tonight
SquaredCircle,"dude no joke, I immediately loved both those teams."
SquaredCircle,"yeah I'm in too, especially since I've kinda just been watching a few dark matches instead of the whole show. got a lot of time for a little tuesday wrestling"
SquaredCircle,I get I've only seen one episode of this show but I really don't think the commentary is that bad
SquaredCircle,DID THAT GUY JUMP OFF THAT GUYS SHOULDER THEN BACKWARDS KICK HIM IN THE FACE WTF THAT WAS AWESOME

SquaredCircle,"I think a lot of it depends on what Brodie does when (or if?) he comes back. 

Since he's been out of the loop, as far as we know, he may completely the halt the whole thing as he's been no fan of hangman since their interaction awhile back, plus the elite in general.

The Dark Order has honestly been making a pretty significant turn without him really-- I mean they're still a group of grimy losers (in storyline), but they haven't exactly been sending people to the hospital lately. 

If Brodie stays out for the foreseeable future, I think he might join and then kind of turn them more towards good dudes, only to be met with Brodie's massive ""hell no"". It could be a leadership struggle, maybe Hangman wants to keep his friends but Brodie insists they reject him. 

Ultimately Hangman is going out on his own again, I can't imagine Dark Order Hangman challenging Kenny for the title, the question is just how. I do believe he's going to join though."
