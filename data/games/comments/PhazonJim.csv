technology,"It would help if they actually put more than zero effort into it. From the NYT piece:

> While Pornhub would not tell me how many moderators it employs, I interviewed one who said that there are about 80 worldwide who work on Mindgeek sites (by comparison, Facebook told me it has 15,000 moderators).

80 fucking moderators for all of their websites. That's unacceptable."
technology,"If they can't afford to moderate the content hosted on their own site then they should not operate the site. I have the same opinion of reddit and other social media sites. It is not the governments (by extension our) responsibility to fund moderation of illegal content on these websites. If they can't figure out methods to do so on their own, that's their problem and they should face the consequences for that.

If you create a website that makes money from user uploaded content, you need to anticipate and plan for dealing with this problem before it happens. Websites have been used against their wishes to host CP since the dawn of the internet - this isn't some new unexpected concept."
Games,"Some subreddits do that but we do not actively prevent any specific users from participating in the subreddit outside of the subreddit ban mechanic. If you see ""X comments"" in a newish thread, 99.99% of the time in /r/Games it means those comments were incredibly low-effort and Automod killed them."

Games,Yeah but in eternal that design philosophy is part of every bit of the game not just some (mostly) optional bonus you can engage in.
Games,Doom Eternal felt more true to the originals because of the arena-like rooms which threw a million things at you at once.
Games,Doom Eternal is far closer to the gameplay of the classic Doom games than Doom 2016.

Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
Games,"Regarding the benchmark changes post launch:

> If you saw our performance preview and were hoping things would radically improve, we've got bad news: Cyberpunk 2077 is every bit as demanding as we showed before.  

Its unbelievable that CDPR had them remove this analysis because it was not an accurate representation of the final product at launch, only for Tom's Hardware to come back and say ""Well uh its the same actually"". There are three scenarios here: 

1. CDPR actually thought that any day 1 patches were going to significantly improve performance of the game

2. CDPR thought Denuvo (on the preview copies) being removed would impact the performance

3. CDPR didn't want the general public to know how bad the game runs until after launch. 

In my opinion, scenario 3 seems to be the most likely at this point considering they also *withheld console review copies and wouldn't let journalists showcase their own footage*."
cyberpunkgame,Yes oh my God I'm not the only one
cyberpunkgame,Tom's Hardware called them on their bullshit and CDPR had the gull to request them to remove the benchmarks since they weren't representative of the final product. TH numbers are exactly what I'm getting on the steam release with the same hardware.
cyberpunkgame,I have serious doubts about that - I have a 2080ti and the only way to get 60fps on ultra is turning off RT or turning DLSS all the way up which has other consequences.

Edit: Accidentally a word."
Games,"Hey there,

This question is better suited for a google search but I can help real quick - your physical disc itself wont get patched but when you put the disc into you console, the game is installed on the harddrive and the console will download any patches and apply those to the game files that were installed in the console. 

So yes you will get the patches if you have an internet connection."

Games,"The primary focus of the article isn't the news about other review outlets not getting their review copies (which is easily verifiable with a quick google search), it is about the consequences of not getting review copies or receiving them late. His personal experience with not receiving a copy is certainly enough information for him to discuss what kind of impact that has on his writing and how it may impact other people who are also not receiving review copies of games in a reasonable amount of time."
Games,"His experience isn't limited to just his anecdotal evidence - there have been a lot of review outlets who have similar concerns/issues getting review copies for the game relative to their experiences with other games/devs. 

Just because you don't care for it doesn't mean its low-effort. It brings up an interesting and important topic in the game reviewing side of the industry."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
Games,I'm not sure how your takeaway from the article was that he's whining about not getting a copy. It's more of a bit of insight into what the reviewers go through to get a review out near when the embargo is lifted and why people should be diligent when reading reviews for a 100+ hour game when the review copies are being sent out rather late in comparison to other games.
Games,It sounds like it's the dudes job so he probably should take it seriously though.
Games,I think a large point of the article is a heads up that a lot of early reviews might be rushed or incomplete as many reviewers still haven't received their review copies yet.
Games,Took me months and months to find a Wii on a shelf.

This is a good follow up to their [previous video posted here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/jzcwk1/weak_cooler_design_playstation_5_thermals_power/) They go into detail talking about how they actually do not think the thermal temps are a problem (The only one that raised an eyebrow for them was the memory module) and that they do not think that you can make the conclusion that the thermal temps will reduce the lifespan in any capacity. They also talk about whether or not you should modify your PS5 yourself to improve cooling - their recommendation is **no, do not modify your console, even if you are comfortable with modding hardware**.

There was a bit of initial controversy over their testing video - quite a few people saw their numbers and assumed their PS5s were going to die in a couple years from heat stress but its pretty clear from this video that they don't believe the numbers they saw to be a long term issue."

Games,"> Guardian go to Riis-Reborn. Pretty much entire campaign got boring because of it and the fact they decided not to add a waypoint in the north side

Christ I actually had forgotten about this. Every other planet has waypoints spread out rather evenly but the lack of north waypoints on Europa is a really bad design choice. I think you are right, it was probably intentionally done to pad out the campaign a bit."
Games,"Overall I have been having a pretty good time with the expansion.

Pros:

* Story is very solid, blended right in with the new seasonal content as well. I'm really interested to see what direction they go with the Darkness. 

* Graphics and gameplay are all very solid which is par for the course in Destiny so far. The new class abilities have some really cool effects. 

* The new PVE Area (Europa) is pretty expansive and the design is well done

* I have not done the Raid yet but I did catch some videos and it seemed like it had some really interesting mechanics introduced

* The new heroic(?) Lost sectors are an awesome addition to enhance the PVE experience.

Cons:

* Sunsetting gear really sucked. I don't play as much as I used to these days so seeing some of my pinnacle gear like Recluse and Delirium become useless stung quite a bit. I'm sure over time I'll pick up some new end-game gear that feels just as good but right now Im just burning through gear to get my LL up and I haven't found any weapons that feel as good yet. 

* Sunsetting activities and locations is a big bummer, I will miss Mars. 

* The campaign was fun but I felt like they did a lot of retreading of the same areas/paths for many of the missions

* While the new subclass abilities are awesome they appear to be rather annoying in PVP - however this was somewhat addressed in one of the recent patches but I think they need to tinker with it a bit more

* This is more of a personal complaint at myself more than anything but most of the folks I played D1 raids with dont play D2 at all so I haven't been able to participate in any of the raids in this game which kind of sucks. It makes sense, they want to give good rewards to the hardcore players, but it does sting if you are a mostly solo player. Tried LFGs and most of the time they were hit and miss. 

* Something significant changed in the way the enemies are controlled/handled in the game code. I have seen a massive amount of enemies teleporting all over the place. 

I think Beyond Light is another mostly good hit for Bungie/Destiny 2 but I think long term Bungie still has a few things to figure out as far as game/gear balance and old content goes."
Games,Valve kind of tried it with Steam Machines and it didn't really work out very well.

Games,"Astros playroom and Miles have been an absolute blast to play. Miles Morales just has a ton of charm in it. And of course Demon's Souls is staggering how good it looks. I've been sticking with the 60fps mode and graphically it's still stunning.

Regarding TV recommendations. If you can swing it, the LG OLED line (B9, C9, CX, etc) are top tier. Rtings has them rated as the best you can get at the moment. Burn in is a risk if you play the same game with static UI elements 24/7 but it your sessions are 5-6 hours long and you let the TV run its display rest functions it's pretty much a non issue."
Games,"Im having some graphical issues on my PS5 but I think it might be related to my LG OLED tv and HDR. There are some flickering pixels in a single column in the main menu and some games occasionally. Not too worried though, Sony is very good about patching software issues like that. If its a TV manufacturer issue though I might be up a creek without a paddle."

Games,Hows the DLC for that?
Games,Played that last month a bit and had a lot of fun with it. Not a huge fan of roguelikes but I appreciated the amount of effort put in and how smooth/fun the gameplay was. It feels a bit slow at first but it really picks up the pace once you start unlocking more weapons.
Games,"*Damn it*. Thats a good catch, thanks for bringing it up in here!"
Games,"Yeah I just booted it up and it has such a nostalgic late 90s shooter vibe to it, love it already!"
Games,"/r/Games has a bit of a thing going in the public discord where we try out an indie game once a month that people vote on. This month's vote was for DUSK - not sure how good it is but it looks like its on sale for $11.59 (down from 20). 

I'm in the middle of installing it now so I'll report back with any impressions I guess if people are interested but I think it was fairly well received just looking at Steam reviews.

FYI since it got brought up - if you are interested in the indie game book club thingo send /r/Games a modmail and we can give you more info."
Games,"I think it also depends on what the field you are going into is. Is it web development? Eh maybe not as important. Is it software engineering for embedded systems? You may want to get a degree for that. I shouldn't have used a large blanket statement like that but for game development and web development, college degrees are increasingly unnecessary."
Games,Haha well I dont want to be super specific with major personal milestones in my life.
Games,"Yar, its stickied now."
Games,"Hmmm its around 7 or so years I think. I spent way too long in school trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Waste of money and time. PSA to people wanting to get into software development, you do not need a formal college degree. It helps sometimes but its not necessary."
Games,"Oh I think you may be thinking of /r/pcgaming, this is /r/games. 

^^^^^some ^^^^^people ^^^^^might ^^^^^argue ^^^^^we ^^^^^are ^^^^^still ^^^^^terrible ^^^^^though"
Games,"I think the problem is a lot of them are young and don't have a lot of practical experience and they don't know just how badly they are getting screwed.

I'm just kind of throwing stones in the dark here but I have noticed an interesting trend over the past 15 years that started up around the time indie studios started blowing up - its a work of passion and sometimes you have to do things for nearly no money and wait for it to pay off later. I've seen countless people fall into the pit of ""Well are a small start up so you will get X% of the games profits whenever we finish it and release it"". Which seems to be largely inspired by all of these indie success stories where you hear about the 1 or 2 man team who just put their sweat and blood into their little project and then released it and made millions. 

These young developers getting into the industry have this fantastical notion of what its like to make games because they aren't hearing about all of the failed projects and all of the money these small studios blow through trying to make their games. Or rather, they hear about those things and think to themselves ""Yeah I guess that just comes with the territory"". So when they see these offers from huge companies for more than $0 its crazy! Oh man I'm actually making money while making games!? They don't realize they have an actual skillset thats worth more than slave labor."
Games,"No mods here by that name, thinking of a different subreddit maybe?"
Games,"Thats a fair callout - We typically remove things for 6.1 if the reporting source/article hasn't added any additional information not found in the original source. For example, the Polygon piece above actually has direct statements from the developers and did some investigative journalism, so it doesn't fall under Rule 6.1"
Games,"CDPR has been known to be fucking over their developers for a long time now. Jason Schreier [has a good write up on the industry screwing over developers, despite the companies making millions and millions of dollars every year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/video-game-contractors-receive-poor-treatment-and-low-salary-as-business-booms?srnd=premium)

From my own anecdotal evidence - when I was beginning to graduate college for a software development related degree, a lot of the students in my classes were applying to game companies and were thrilled to be getting entry level positions (usually QA) for 30k USD a year or less and shite benefits. A lot of us thought that was great until we saw what other tech industry companies such as banks were offering (60k+ for entry level). Unfortunately a lot of people elected to go for the game development because it ""wasn't about the money, it was about the experience"".

Haha [here is an article (GamesIndustry.biz)](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-10-16-cd-projekt-red-responds-to-glassdoor-reviews) from a few years ago discussing developers complaining about low pay and crunch on Glassdoor as well as CDPR's limp fish response."
Games,"I think if a major news outlet picked up on the story and did a write up on it and verified some of the information we'd probably allow it then. 

For example, we allowed [a large Polygon piece on the exploitations of young developers at Chucklefish here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/cyxva5/young_developers_on_starbound_say_chucklefish/) - it had interviews with the developers and statements from Chucklefish on the matter. Individual tweets / statements from developers we look at on a case by case basis."
Games,"That was removed after an in-depth team discussion on it, the team at large felt it fell under Rule 7.11. However we did feel like the over-arcing discussion was still important so thats why the megathread was stood up, as a place to collect anything we were would usually remove. Additionally, since the thread was so large we put a link to it above in case anyone wants to dive into it."
Games,"Thanks, it has been added."

Games,That specific video was removed because the entire first 37 minutes of the video was full of personal stories and no actual critical analysis of Doom.
Games,"One of the things we look at when we remove for 7.11 is if the submission puts in a fair bit of constructive criticism / talking points for discussion / examples to back up arguments. In the examples you posted, I think that those probably would be permissible in the subreddit. The first one may be on the lower-effort side. 

Taking a look at the submission removals from /u/rGamesMods over the past few days I see 4 submissions removed for 7.11.

* One is deleted so can't say much there

* A rant about motion controls in Mario Galaxy - removed because it was really more of a rant about a single mechanic in one game and was a bit low-effort

* A submission clarifying who the developers of Medieval Dynasty are - removed because its more of a PSA and not exactly a submission geared towards informative/interesting discussion. 7.11 may have been the wrong rule to use here as it kind of falls into a couple rules. 

* A customer support issue with EA accounts/email - removed because we do not allow submissions focused on customer support issues 

For us, ""shower thoughts"", ""rants"" and ""anecdotal stories"" kind of fall into the category of ""here is a fun raid story from back when I was super into WoW"" or ""I dont like this game because its a fucking trash game and the developers should feel bad"". 

Submissions such as the ones you linked from /r/truegaming would be welcome here, and in fact we encourage such submissions in our list of [quality discussion examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/quality_discussion)."
Games,"Some submissions get automatically removed because of some of the filters we have set up in Automoderator that are designed to remove extremely low-effort posts that are a very short (in your example one paragraph long). If you have a submission removed and you think there wasn't an issue with it, you can ask about it here or send us a message about it and we can try to explain the rationale a bit better.

Games,"> I'm curious about this as well

To be very frank, we are not going to ban news/trailers because it goes against the spirit of the subreddit and would effectively kill a huge portion of the content here. 

Per our sidebar description:

> The goal of /r/Games is to provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions. Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just with the goal of entertaining viewers.

[Per our rule wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules):

> Allowed Submissions
Submissions that fall under these categories will be approved.

> * **News and Article**s: Please check whether the link or a very similar one has already been submitted and make sure you track down original sources (articles that just copy or link content from a different site without adding significant information are considered blogspam). **Otherwise, this is the kind of content this subreddit was made for!**

> * . . ."
Games,"1. Nope we're not. I believe reddit did away with the concept of default subs actually.

2. Mostly to avoid issues like brigading from folks who don't normally frequent the subreddit."
Games,"Can you cite where a moderator informed you they hadn't watched that video? Generally speaking if a moderator has removed a submission and it goes back up, this means we've had internal discussions and decided as a team to put it back up, or the original moderator made a mistake and corrected it.

Edit: I believe I have found the communication between us you are referring to, with your permission I can share it here so we can try to understand your interpretation of it."
Games,"Thanks for the feedback on this. We try to be a bit cautious with leaks and rumors, especially those from retailer listings as those have been historically unreliable. Retailers often list things months to years in advance without anything actually happening ([Metroid Prime Trilogy HD listings comes to mind](https://media1.giphy.com/media/1BXa2alBjrCXC/giphy.gif)). Some people spend a lot of time producing fake screenshots and marketing materials so we try to make sure to check a few things like the source of the rumor and what kind of evidence there is. For example, if source of the rumor or leak is a random tweet or 4chan, we tend to need a bit more information to allow that. That doesn't mean that there isn't a bit of room for improvement here however, but in the meantime I (personally) think a good alternative for that kind of content would be /r/GamingLeaksAndRumours"
Games,"Tim Roger's videos aren't banned - we watch them on a case-by-case basis to determine if they fall under Rule 1 or not. The same goes with Zero Punctuation, Dunkey, and Jim Sterling videos."
Games,"One of the more specific topics that has been brought up recently is that the subreddit does not have enough discussion focused submissions and is more of a newsfeed. This is a fairly accurate observation if you take a look at the front page at any given day. A majority (if not all) of the submissions are trailers or news. Historically, most of the self-post discussion submissions that are removed from here are either asking for recommendations/names of old games (Rule 7.1) or are extraordinarily low-effort in nature (Rule 3.2 - a few short sentences that don't really provide many talking points for discussion). If people are interested we may be able to get the specific percentages on that. 

Those self-post discussions that do remain up seem to do rather poorly in relation to submissions that are trailers or news/articles, getting few comments/upvotes. That is not to say that some discussions don't take off, we know that some do very well occasionally. 

We would like to continue seeing the informative and interesting discussions but we are curious if the community has any ideas on how to promote more of these without banning things like news/trailers. This may be a symptom of the subreddit growing quite large in size - the bigger the community gets, the more of a ""hivemind"" it becomes regarding topics/types of submissions its interested in."

Games,"Well it sounds like since your request is rather broad, the best place to discuss it would be the next Meta Monday thread thats open to all topics. In the meantime,  try to collect specific examples for us to address. Feed back like:

> A number of users, myself included, have had posts or comments that have been taken down under dubious reasoning citing a rule that doesn't quite pertain to the topic that is being taken down - if a reason is given at all.

Isn't helpful for discussion if you do not have examples that we explain or apologize for. Sometimes we make mistakes but if we don't know what specifically is an issue, we can't document and improve on that. 

> Posts with thousands of upvotes, hundreds of comments and some deep discussion are often removed out of the blue with a random rule cite.

If we remove a submission with lots of comments/votes its because it broke a specific rule, not a random rule. If you have an example of a submission removed with a random rule we can take a look. 

> When posts are removed under 'Rule 4: No duplicate posts' and proof is requested of the moderation staff of the duplicate post - none can be given or the reason received is dismissive.

If you have an example of us being unable to give explanations for a Rule 4 removal, or the explanation was dismissive, that would be helpful. 

> Certain content is sometimes permitted and other days it isn't. This can range from topics being covered on the subreddit, a YouTuber/source/site being allowed or not that day, certain news coverage in gaming, META content, etc.

If you have any examples of content/topics allowed on some days and not others, or sources allowed in some cases and not others, that would be helpful for us so we can address it. Meta content is generally never permitted if you have any recent examples of it being allowed that would be helpful. 

> Rule 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 all seem to require expanding upon or at the very least further clarification is needed for the community alongside more uniform moderation by the /r/games team as a whole.

If you can elaborate what about these rules are unclear we would be happy to improve the language used in them."

Games,"Hey there,

The proper place to discuss those kinds of topics are in these Meta Monday submissions, or through messaging the moderators. If you have a specific topic you'd like to propose for one of the next Meta Mondays we'd be happy to take note of it. 

I see in the previous threads(s) the main topic was the lack of discussion vs posts about news/trailers. We could have a Meta  Monday focusing on that but to be very frank, we do not control the volume of discussion vs news submissions here - that falls into the hands of the community. The unfortunate reality is that most discussion submissions get downvoted and ignored here. We remove a large amount of self-posts for Rule 7.1 as most of them are asking for game suggestions or are **incredibly** low-effort."

Games,"> Idk if you noticed this but on occasions, there's a strange Reddit bug/glitch that when we submit a link, it does not show up for some reason for public to see. I don't remember which sites they were but it happens. We only see it when clicking on whoever submitted the content on their Reddit profile page.

If I am understanding what you are describing correctly, it is probably the submission being either marked as spam by reddit, in which case we do not have any insight as to which sites are spam filtered, or your submission was filtered for review by human moderators because it tripped one of our automoderator rules. We dont go into specifics as to what those rules are or which sites hit them but if you suspect your submission is hidden please reach out and we can take a look. 

> This sounds really ambigious. Every one would have different impressions on what is permissible but I think the general consensus is that if the article itself has a lot or important info, I think it should definitely be permissible.

Its really not very ambiguous - if a developer has a trailer or announcement link directly to that if you can. If the article is primarily rehashing/summarizing the announcement we dont consider that significant or new information and it will be removed for Rule 6.1. if you have some specific examples we can walk through what is or is not appropriate as an original source."

Games,"> And if it's not possible, then a third party site is ok? Does a mod manually check this so I can assure they won't be removed on accident?

When we remove submissions for Rule 6.1 we do validate that there is an original source that can be submitted instead. Very very rarely is the original source not possible to submit - in the rare cases where its not possible, its usually due to the information being behind a paywall, not english, or its buried deep inside of some sort of financial document/pdf. It might be better if you have an example that we could look at. 

> Regarding AMAs, I mean answers, not the actual AMAs itself. What I'm referring to is new or important info related to gaming (whether it's expanded info on a game, franchise, industry, etc).

We typically don't remove any answers from the AMAs, do you have an example? 

> And sorry for one last question but do you know which sites are generally not allowed even when we can't find the direct source? (excluding ones with paywalls)

If there is no possible way to submit the original source usually any alternative is permissible, though we do look at those on a case by case basis to make sure they conform to our other rules."
Games,"Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules), specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban."
Games,"If there is an announcement or trailer for example, we consider the source of the information to be the horse's mouth, so to speak. Many times these outlets pick up blog posts from developers which cover game updates or they may embed tweets and cover some announcement from Twitter. In all of these cases, if its possible to submit the Tweet/blogpost/etc from the developer, please do. There isnt a preference for an outlet - if a site such as IGN or Gematsu is linking to a developer's announcement just submit the announcement directly instead. 

In regards to AMAs the only AMAs we host are ones who have been planned in advance per [our guideline here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/amaguidelines). Impromptu AMAs are not permitted, but if you could cite any examples we may be able to give more information."
