Games,"Hi /u/PC-gaming-view,

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 7.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_specific_content_restrictions)**.

> **Avoid questions that have a limited scope or with a specific obtainable answer**

> ""Should I buy game X?""

> ""Where do I download Steam?""

> ""What is the best strategy to use in game X?""

> ""What should I play next?""

> ""Help me find what game I played X years ago.""

> Questions posed in self-posts should be able to encourage discussion and not result in short responses or be too limited for quality discussion.

If an alternative source contributes significant and meaningful analysis or commentary on information given by the original source, it may be allowed but please try to locate and link the original source wherever possible instead.

> If the original source is inaccessible, due to a paywall or any similar mechanisms that otherwise impede viewing the content without some form of transaction, usually non-monetary in nature, such as giving information, creating an account and logging in, etc., then posting an alternative as a source is acceptable.

> This rule does not apply to original sources that are not in English: an alternative source that provides an adequate translation (automated translations, such as Google Translate, is not permitted) is acceptable.

Games,"Hi /u/Octocamo,

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 6.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_formatting_requirements)**.

> **Submission Title Formatting** - Please use the original sources title when appropriate. If an article or video's title is unclear, convoluted, or does not meet the requirements outlined below, changes are allowed to further clarify or remove editorialized/sensationalized language.

> * **Don’t use editorialized, sensationalized titles** - Don't add things like ""This deserves attention"" or ""why isn't this being talked about"".

> * **Titles must not contain inflammatory language** - Do not use language that is clearly inflammatory - keep posts and discussions civil.

> * **Titles must not be in all-caps** - Except in cases where the original source title has capital letters, such as with some Japanese video game titles. Videos with excessive caps in the source title may be removed at moderator's discretion.

> * **Keep titles concise and not overly long** - If you feel that a link needs additional information or context you should create a self-post to include the information along with the link.

> * **Titles must be in English** - No exceptions for titles, see below for articles.

> If you are unsure whether or not changing a title will be appropriate please feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames). If your submission contains important information that is not mentioned in the original title and you wish to highlight it, you may create a text post with a modified title that includes this information and elaborates further in the post with a link to the original article in question and quotes the relevant excerpt.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind.

**[Rule 6.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_formatting_requirements)**.

> **Link to the original source; if the original source is inaccessible, then link to an acceptable alternative** - When a website embeds or copies content (articles, videos, interviews, etc.) from another source without adding significant information, we consider this blogspam. If an alternative source contributes significant and meaningful analysis or commentary on information given by the original source, it may be allowed but please try to locate and link the original source wherever possible instead.

> If the original source is inaccessible, due to a paywall or any similar mechanisms that otherwise impede viewing the content without some form of transaction, usually non-monetary in nature, such as giving information, creating an account and logging in, etc., then posting an alternative as a source is acceptable.

> This rule does not apply to original sources that are not in English: an alternative source that provides an adequate translation (automated translations, such as Google Translate, is not permitted) is acceptable.

**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

> * **Titles must not contain inflammatory language** - Do not use language that is clearly inflammatory - keep posts and discussions civil.

> * **Titles must not be in all-caps** - Except in cases where the original source title has capital letters, such as with some Japanese video game titles. Videos with excessive caps in the source title may be removed at moderator's discretion.

> * **Keep titles concise and not overly long** - If you feel that a link needs additional information or context you should create a self-post to include the information along with the link.

> * **Titles must be in English** - No exceptions for titles, see below for articles.

> If you are unsure whether or not changing a title will be appropriate please feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames).

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind.

**[Rule 6.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_formatting_requirements)**.

> **Link to the original source; if the original source is inaccessible, then link to an acceptable alternative** - When a website embeds or copies content (articles, videos, interviews, etc.) from another source without adding significant information, we consider this blogspam. If an alternative source contributes significant and meaningful analysis or commentary on information given by the original source, it may be allowed but please try to locate and link the original source wherever possible instead.

> If the original source is inaccessible, due to a paywall or any similar mechanisms that otherwise impede viewing the content without some form of transaction, usually non-monetary in nature, such as giving information, creating an account and logging in, etc., then posting an alternative as a source is acceptable.

> This rule does not apply to original sources that are not in English: an alternative source that provides an adequate translation (automated translations, such as Google Translate, is not permitted) is acceptable.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> * **Keep titles concise and not overly long** - If you feel that a link needs additional information or context you should create a self-post to include the information along with the link.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

> **Link to the original source; if the original source is inaccessible, then link to an acceptable alternative** - When a website embeds or copies content (articles, videos, interviews, etc.) from another source without adding significant information, we consider this blogspam. If an alternative source contributes significant and meaningful analysis or commentary on information given by the original source, it may be allowed but please try to locate and link the original source wherever possible instead.

> If the original source is inaccessible, due to a paywall or any similar mechanisms that otherwise impede viewing the content without some form of transaction, usually non-monetary in nature, such as giving information, creating an account and logging in, etc., then posting an alternative as a source is acceptable.

> This rule does not apply to original sources that are not in English: an alternative source that provides an adequate translation (automated translations, such as Google Translate, is not permitted) is acceptable.

> **Review Threads** - Review threads may not be posted sooner than five minutes prior to the embargo lifting. If no embargo exists, then a minimum of four completed reviews is needed before a review thread can be created. Those who post a review thread must provide updates periodically throughout the day. Failure to do so may result in the thread being removed, and the creator of the thread not being allowed to post future review threads.

> Any reviews posted within a week after a review thread has been established will be removed for Rule 4. If extenuating circumstances result in the publication of a substantial amount of reviews after the initial review thread, the creation of additional review threads is permitted. If this occurs and a new review thread is established, reviews posted outside of the review thread will continue to be removed for Rule 4 up to one week after the new review thread is created.

> For clarification, review threads refer to threads that collate reviews together, often with a score from a review aggregator such as OpenCritic or MetaCritic. Please see this review thread for an example.

**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

**[Rule 6.13](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_formatting_requirements)**.

> **Review Threads** - Review threads may not be posted sooner than five minutes prior to the embargo lifting. If no embargo exists, then a minimum of four completed reviews is needed before a review thread can be created. Those who post a review thread must provide updates periodically throughout the day. Failure to do so may result in the thread being removed, and the creator of the thread not being allowed to post future review threads.

> Any reviews posted within a week after a review thread has been established will be removed for Rule 4. If extenuating circumstances result in the publication of a substantial amount of reviews after the initial review thread, the creation of additional review threads is permitted. If this occurs and a new review thread is established, reviews posted outside of the review thread will continue to be removed for Rule 4 up to one week after the new review thread is created.

> For clarification, review threads refer to threads that collate reviews together, often with a score from a review aggregator such as OpenCritic or MetaCritic. Please see this review thread for an example.

Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> * **Keep titles concise and not overly long** - If you feel that a link needs additional information or context you should create a self-post to include the information along with the link.

> * **Titles must be in English** - No exceptions for titles, see below for articles.

> If you are unsure whether or not changing a title will be appropriate please feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames).

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **Review Threads** - Review threads may not be posted sooner than five minutes prior to the embargo lifting. If no embargo exists, then a minimum of four completed reviews is needed before a review thread can be created. Those who post a review thread must provide updates periodically throughout the day. Failure to do so may result in the thread being removed, and the creator of the thread not being allowed to post future review threads.

> Any reviews posted within a week after a review thread has been established will be removed for Rule 4. If extenuating circumstances result in the publication of a substantial amount of reviews after the initial review thread, the creation of additional review threads is permitted. If this occurs and a new review thread is established, reviews posted outside of the review thread will continue to be removed for Rule 4 up to one week after the new review thread is created.

> For clarification, review threads refer to threads that collate reviews together, often with a score from a review aggregator such as OpenCritic or MetaCritic. Please see this review thread for an example.

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_promotion_must_be_kept_within_acceptable_limits)**.

> **Promotional Content Requirements**

> We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

> **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

> **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

> * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind. Asking for upvotes *anywhere* (whether it's in the title of the submission or a Twitter message) isn't allowed. We also have ways to detect irregular behavior by fake accounts, etc. For an in-depth explanation of what constitutes vote manipulation and why it is undesirable, check out [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/)

> If you have any questions or would like additional clarification on the promotion rules for /r/Games, feel free to [send the mods a message about it!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

> **This is considered an official warning. Further Rule 8 violations may result in greater consequences, up to and including an account and/or domain ban from this subreddit.**

Games,"Hi /u/Rubber_Duckie_,

Thank you for posting to /r/Games. Unfortunately, we have removed this submission per 
**[Rule 6.13](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_formatting_requirements)**.

> **Review Threads** - Review threads may not be posted sooner than five minutes prior to the embargo lifting. If no embargo exists, then a minimum of four completed reviews is needed before a review thread can be created. Those who post a review thread must provide updates periodically throughout the day. Failure to do so may result in the thread being removed, and the creator of the thread not being allowed to post future review threads.

> Any reviews posted within a week after a review thread has been established will be removed for Rule 4. If extenuating circumstances result in the publication of a substantial amount of reviews after the initial review thread, the creation of additional review threads is permitted. If this occurs and a new review thread is established, reviews posted outside of the review thread will continue to be removed for Rule 4 up to one week after the new review thread is created.

> For clarification, review threads refer to threads that collate reviews together, often with a score from a review aggregator such as OpenCritic or MetaCritic. Please see this review thread for an example.

**[Rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules)**.
