hotsauce,Does this particular sauce (the fiery habanero) need to be refrigerated after opening? I was going to order a gallon for myself but I swear the little bottle says refrigerate and I already take up my maximum allotted fridge space for hot sauces :D

AskReddit,"Me too. This year started with me having to pay for an absolutely insanely expensive renovation for my franchised store. It was required of course and I had to get it done before I could sell my store, which I’ve been trying to do for years. I had a buyer lined up for after the reno so I had that to look forward to at least. 

We reopened at the end of February and Covid started right after.  It got slow as hell for a couple weeks. I was scared I wasn’t going to be able to pay not only myself, but for my reno, and worst of all my employees.

About mid March we had out of the blue one of the busiest days I’d ever seen. Then the next day. Then the next. It just kept going. It was awesome at first. I gave all my staff raises and bonus’ since they were busting ass. This of course came with negatives though. Where we are people have and still are pretending COVID isn’t a thing.  So we had to enforce policies like “no cash” “one customer in at a time” “wait outside for your order” etc as well as extra cleaning. Personally I was getting screamed at at least three times a day, as the owner of the store. My staff took worse especially when I wasn’t there. I told multiple customers to fuck off and never come back.

It didn’t matter we kept getting busier. Tourist season started and it’s been huge this year, I’m guessing because interprovincial travel is allowed but people can’t leave the country easily. I literally can’t keep my store stocked anymore. My staff exhausted. I’m exhausted. I gave them more bonus’ but I think we’ve all hit a point where money isn’t helping anymore. Everyone just wants a break. Unfortunately my franchise is a hard ass about letting you close down for a day or two. We are literally allowed to be closed on Christmas Day and that’s it. So I’ve been trying to cycle staff days off to give everyone a break but I’m finding now I need more staff and there aren’t a lot of people looking for work here for whatever reason. Literally every restaurant in town is hiring and struggling to get people. So I guess I just keep on going and hope September will be better? I haven’t had a break this year, I haven’t done anything fun, I miss my hobbies. 

Oh and my sale got fucked by COVID. They wouldn’t do interviews or training for months (no one could figure out how to do it remotely I guess). If I’m lucky my buyer might be back in 2021, but I have my doubts at this point. It feels like a job from hell that pays decent but doesn’t allow you the time to actually do anything with that. The worst part is I can’t even just quit or walk out. I’ve honestly weighed the consequences of lately though and I’m not sure how much longer it’ll be before going bankrupt seems like a reasonable way to quit this fucking job.  This doesn’t even touch on the fact that I’m scared to see my parents as they’re older and I’m exposed to the public daily, or the stress this amount of work has put on my relationships. 

I miss normal life."

snowrunner,"I haven’t made it far enough to say for sure yet, but I started knocking off tasks that clear road ways, that way I can map some easier routes out for the big trucks. There’s also a trailer that can attach to a scout vehicle up in the north/north east area that helps a fair amount if you can get it. Otherwise I’ve thrown a flat bed and crane on my free star which is much nicer than hauling trailers (they add a lot of weight which makes it hard to haul stuff through mud).

Edit: it’s worth mentioning too, some routes are simply too mucky for the big trucks. The road heading to the warehouse from the garage is a good example of that. It is doable but slow. I’ve started going through the farm up just past the gas station (there’s a bridge you can repair there), take a right after the bridge and cross the stream. The roads not nearly as bad the main one although you’re going to have to get through that main road to get supplies to fix the bridge at least once."
snowrunner,"There’s a broken down free star (?) heavy duty truck sitting right beside the first garage entrance. Winch it a few feet with the gmc, hop in and enter the garage to get it fully repaired for free. It’s a much better truck for off road hauling, and has an easy to obtain awd upgrade.

edit: I'm not even sure you have to winch it, although I did, you can probably just get in it and recover it."

Games,"That makes sense, as I definitely remember at least the Duke Burger part, which as /u/UsingTrash mentioned was added into the second level. Strangely another thing my hazy memory (this was like... 20 years ago minimum?) recalls is the ship from ""Babe World"" featured in the video. The wiki for Duke Nukem 3d doesn't mention this level being included however. Could just be my memory playing tricks on me however, and it's possible I played this level as part the Atomic Edition or something at some point in my life I've forgotten."
Games,"This is bothering the hell out of me so maybe someone can help me out here. I remember playing some of these levels, but I don't think I owned this pack.

gaming,"I think a huge amount of this sort of relationship came from dedicated servers back in the day. I for one know that I'd look up names of well run servers going from one game to another. For example if I enjoyed the SOE servers in Battlefield 1942, when CoD released, I'd do a search for their clan to see if they ran a server on there. Surprisingly a lot of the time they would have made the same leap as I did, and therefore I'd see a bunch of familiar names. Stick around one group of servers long enough and you'd eventually end up with an invite to their Team Speak or Ventrillo server if you weren't totally toxic.

Shout out to the ol' SOE, Ubiquity, and DR2nd groups. I used to play under Morte with them when I was young."

Games,"I wanted to mention this mod since it has a few features that can greatly improve sim lifespans and game time, [MCCC](https://deaderpool-mccc.com/). You can get some errors if you screw up the settings, but basic functions like changing life spans are pretty safe. For example, you can make Toddler/Child/Teen lifespans fairly short while extending your Young Adult/Adult life spans out to feel more complete. Another feature I really enjoy using is the game time speed adjustment. Making an ingame hour last even a small amount longer (I think I added about 5 to 10% to the default) can give you a good amount more time in a day to get all your Sims tasks done. There's a TON of other options, some more useful than others, and some can risk breaking some pretty important game options, but I can't go back to the sims without this mod anymore. /u/kaptingavrin mentioned the time a restaurant meal can take above, so I wanted to him them about this for the game time speed adjustment as well, as it can help a lot with that issue (I felt the same whenever I took my Sims to a restaurant)"

This is indeed blog spam, if you follow the trailer link it links to the dev's blog that holds all the original information found [here](http://deathtrash.com/blog).

Just a heads up, in the future you may have more luck mod mailing us, we don't get notifications on replies to automoderator, and I just happened to stumble into the comments while review this post :)

Games,"Hey Sunfury, just wanted to correct something here, the statistics we use to judge ""activity"" includes everything you would find in the toolbox mod matrix. This includes removals of course, approvals, bans, unbans, spam marking, editing flairs, editing contributors, distinguishing comments, editing settings, editing the wiki, and damn near everything else you can do as a mod except mod mail (and I wish it included that sometimes). It just happens that for almost all mods removals are the highest activity."
Games,"I hit my monthly minimum in less than an hour of active moderating most times, it's really very reasonable (and no, I don't just remove things because I need actions). The only reason there is a minimum is to ensure we have mods that are actually contributing and not just sitting on the mod list claiming to try and be more active every month. In every single case that a person has had a reason that they may not be able to hit the minimum, they have been excused from hitting it that month."

HailCorporate,Why have you never had an issue with ANY other AMA on the sub? By your logic they should all be an issue! What do you want to see transparent? That they mod mailed and us we replied? JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER AMA EVER ARRANGED ON ANY SUB EVER. You realize we are all volunteers right? Enjoy your conspiracy.
HailCorporate,"I'm really curious as to how you think people arrange AMA's? The publisher or the dev ask, and the mod team helps to arrange it. In this case, the publisher asked, and we helped arrange it. The end. If more indie dev's asked, and verified themselves, there would be more. Just for fun, here's our last 5 AMA's (not including this one):  
[Cyanide Studios](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/9so733/ama_we_are_cyanide_studio_developers_of_call_of/) - not exactly a huge name, but known enough  
[Six Ages Developer/Designer/Producer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/907qnp/ama_by_developerdesignerproducer_of_six_ages_and/) - I mean... enough said about that one  
[Parsec, a streaming software](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/8ulapu/hey_reddit_were_the_cofounders_of_parsec_chris/)  
[Vampyr Dev team, DONTNOD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/8oh2e0/ama_we_are_dontnod_developers_of_vampyr/)  
[Swery65, a small time but well known dev in some circles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/8dehl0/i_am_swery65_a_game_designer_known_as_the_creator/) - You'd have to be crazy to consider Swery a ""big name"".

Those are also 5 of the last 7 requests we received. Of two not included one gave us very little notice and therefore didn't happen, and the other had to delay and hasn't responded about when they may be able to reschedule. If you go back a little over a year, you'll find that actually *most* of our AMA's are from indie, and small time devs. 

I hope this information helps to clear things up as to how we handle AMA's. "
Games,"Not in a long time (maybe once in my 2+ years here) has someone been turned completely away. When I first came on we had a influx of AMA's for some time, then they trickled off a bit. In the last few months we simply haven't received many requests. Those that we have, have been posted here. Looking back, we had one at the end of October, one in July, one in June, one in May. That really isn't a lot, so I can understand why some people might think it must be tough to get one. In reality though, not that many people have asked lately. "

The chicken Caesar salad on the menu caught my eye as it had some interesting sounding ingredient and home made dressing. Also I’d been drinking rather heavy the night before and felt like something lighter than a burger might be perfect.

They didn’t even chop the head of lettuce. It came out as a romaine heart with the stem, tips, everything untouched, and the toppings arranged around the side. It didn’t come with a knife, I had to ask for one, at which point they brought me a bloody butter knife. I’ve never have more difficulty eating a salad in my life, all I could assume was I must have been the first one to actually order this mess, or maybe the prep chefs all quit and the cook said fuck it, send it.

If we allowed it stay up we inevitably will have someone post something similar down the line and use that approval as an example as to why their post should have stayed up. I know it’s unfortunate to remove a post that has spawned some positive discussion, but in most cases it is a necessary evil. Thank you for your understanding."
Games,"I don't normally jump into comments to clarify removals and the such, as usually such matters are better handled in mod mail where multiple moderators can weigh in on a subject. In this case however I wanted to point out that the post you are referring to was a link to a tweet that simply said ""GG, stand by for official confirmation."" with no context, further information, or... well anything else.

Removed for being a short top level comment

>I have all Souls games, but I might've bought this, since I don't have the Remaster, scholar of the first sin or the DkS 3 Dlc.

Removed for being a comment on a joke thread, when we nuke a comment we generally take all the child comments with it (you'll notice I made an exception on this one to try and resolve your issues)

>You could go buy all those and save money.

See above

>Is the head of Bamco a fucking idiot? So many dumb moves lately

Pretty low effort and also witch hunty

>What the hell is going on with the censorship in this comments section?

Removed by auto mod for being a short top level comment, also completely off topic to the post.

If you want to continue this discussion may I suggest mod mail? There's no reason to clog up the subreddit with wild accusations when people may actually come here to learn about the decision in the topic."
Games,"Most of the comments in here have been removed by automod for being short high level comments. A few were removed for being simple jokes, or off topic. I don't see anything removed that could be considered censorship, perhaps you could point a few out and I could explain further? Mod mail is a good place to bring this up by the way."

EscapefromTarkov,"I'd like to start off by saying, thank you for the taking the time to offer some feedback!

While I understand where you are coming from concerning rules, and it may work in some instances (such as subreddits with rather broad subject matter), we do find it necessary to have rules in place, and ones that can be referenced in a removal. It helps to give the users a clear and concise reason as to what was wrong with their post, and how to possibly fix it. Allowing upvotes/downvotes to decide on something may work in some subreddits, but how would you like to visit here everyday and see the same meme's constantly at the top of the page? We are already dangerously close to that some days!

To address some of the concerns I've read in this thread, we are currently in discussion on revamping some of our rules. A few of our rules have always been problems, by either being too broad in scope, or by having some strange time restrictions mixed in with them (looking at you rule 1 and  10). We hope to move this process along quickly, but if there's one thing I've learned about moderating in my years doing it, it can take a bit of time to get a bunch of people who live in different parts of the world to all agree on something."

Please review our rule 8 before linking to vgr.com again on our subreddit. You currently have over 60% of your submitted content linked to this site. Thank you!"
AskReddit,My cat used to crawl through the vents in my house. I’d be in the bathroom doing my business (surfing reddit) and boom this cat would pop outa the vent and come chill by me. Eventually he got too big to fit comfortably and I had to tape them all down as he still tried to do this. I also think he has a collection of coins and lighters down there. 
AskReddit,My one cat does this too! And his poo stinks. Luckily my other cat is of higher intelligence and buries it for him. Generally she then beats him after as punishment.
