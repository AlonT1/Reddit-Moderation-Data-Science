Is this last bit new? I remember that being the only problem I had with this feature, that daily automod megathreads would spam up people's notifications.  The only improvement I could think of past this would be an option on the post itself when you go to pin it determining if you want it to be an exception to the current announcement setting (either on or off)."

modnews,"Key word ""enjoy"". The implication seemed to be New Reddit was an objectively bad idea and the admins were wrong to implement it when many users of Old Reddit decried it."
modnews,"If I did care about the community I run (which I do) and *didn't* trust the admins of the site to be competent (I *do* trust them on that), I would lock the subreddit and redirect users to a site that was better than Reddit in that respect, which may not exist."
modnews,"*Everyone knows* that ""if you're not paying for it you're the product"", we hear this same line every time anything about any free-to-use service comes up, but if you really think that is the literal only thing that matters then it would be best to stop following admin updates altogether.

It is possible to acknowledge that *of course* Reddit is wanting to trend toward maximum profit but also think that they care at least the smallest amount about actual on-site problems, as evidenced by dozens to hundreds of past incidents of said problems being fixed as they come up.  Is it perfect? No, but if you don't have at least a little faith then why even moderate on the platform if you believe they don't care about you or your communities?"
modnews,"Because a majority of new users to the site enjoy using New Reddit - or, hell, even the mobile app.  Even if it is the default, the fact that Old Reddit still exists and has been promised to be kept is something most websites don't do.

I don't think admins are perfect, I think this decision here in this post is a very long time coming and that they ignored feedback that would have led them to this conclusion sooner, but to claim they flat out don't care at all is inaccurate and likely to cause misunderstandings when asking about upcoming features."

Games,"I just want to give my own opinion here:

The concept of having first principles laid out for a subreddit is an interesting one, but ultimately not something I think we could adequately pin down for /r/games in particular.  I have only been a moderator here for a bit more than a year, and the subreddit has existed for *twelve years* - it is one of the oldest subreddits around.  While I do think the core idea of being a somewhat more curated space for gaming news and discussion has remained static for all this time, the specifics of what should and should not be allowed have certainly changed.

We *do* have suggestions for what things people should post - there is [a box on the sidebar](https://i.imgur.com/aSONmGw.png) along with [the first portion of the rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_allowed_submissions) and even [a small wiki page about some good discussion examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/quality_discussion).  These are pretty broad categories, but I think if we were to specifically list more granular things we encourage / don't encourage, we'd have a page half a mile long that not many people would bother to read.

To take a specific example:  The whole ""announcement of another announcement"" thing is something we internally have discussed, and we ended up [posing the question to the userbase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/frqnpa/weekly_rgames_discussion_meta_monday_handling/) on whether we should allow such posts or not.  Responses were pretty evenly split, so we ended up staying the course and not making a ruling on them one way or the other.  Ultimately we don't have a rule that specifies how ""newsworthy"" a submission must be to remain up, because it's hard to draw a specific line - one of the reasons the rules are as long as they are is that we try to avoid vagueness as much as possible and even then there's always going to be a little.  We have a rule about being on-topic, and a rule about not being low-effort, but these don't stop someone from, say, posting an update about a small indie game as long as they don't break any other rules.  What people find important or interesting in the gaming sphere will differ, and so content of any scale from AAA development to one person working on a demo would be allowed.

I personally think that this sub is already one of the more restrictive ones related to gaming (not necessarily a bad thing) - most people who comment on this remark that we're *too* restrictive - and focusing in even more by excluding certain types of news would be pushing it too far."

If you don't like this, leave the platform.  There have been other alternative platforms touted for a long time, from Voat to Ruqqus, and while I have a pretty good idea how they'll all eventually turn out, at least you can enjoy an ideal free speech haven while it lasts."

modnews,"None, for a long time.  Reddit doesn't push subs as default anymore."
modnews,"It really probably won't come up often, but I am curious how many subs new users subscribe to and how quickly."
modnews,"> Before we removed the limit, we made a few tweaks to the number of messages a redditor can receive on a given day. This was especially important for a new redditor joining a lot of communities through the onboarding process. Now we cap the number of welcome messages in a given day to seven.

Are messages that get held back because of this sent at a later time or not sent at all?

This is a minor question, overall I was very excited for this feature to eventually roll out to everyone, it should prove useful."

darkestdungeon,"I managed to get both Reynauld *and* Dismas back from the dead through the one event on separate occasions - after I got one, I deliberately stalled to see if I could get the other, and sure enough I picked up Dismas right around week 150."
darkestdungeon,"They hadn't known what horrors they'd face, and of the four, three paid with their lives - unprepared and begging for mercy until the end.  But one withstood, powering through falling rubble and chopping through rotting pews until his sword struck true.

So many months and years later, Pippery was finally able to settle his debt with Death, and in doing so helped strike the final vengeance his fallen comrades deserved.

---

Recently completed my first playthrough blind - the first Prophet bossfight was very nearly a loss due to me not knowing what the boss even was, but Pippery managed to tank and dodge enough falling rubble to see it through.  When the final mission rolled around and he was still alive, I knew he had to be part of it - but I didn't know what would happen when I picked him for this attack (although I had a good guess).  Rest in peace, Pip.

(Brai the Occultist, however, I cared much less about sacrificing due to the amount of low heal bleeds they put out)"
