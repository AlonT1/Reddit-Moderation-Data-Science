Trails in the Sky starts very slow which is gonna put a lot of people off of it.

TLDR, Cold Steel stands alone as it's own thing, but it's really just a part of a much bigger story across multiple (9 now) games and it's some of the best world building in a JRPG I've experienced."

modnews,"Frankly speaking, what good are advisory councils if they consist of mostly the same set of powermods that incestuously co-moderate the same set of large subs? I'm sure I'll ruffle a few feathers here, but at this point what does it really matter if I upset some powermods?

Over at /r/Games we have very few (if any) mods that moderate more than /r/Games, and if they do then they moderate much smaller subs (hundreds or thousands of subscribers at most). Did any of our moderators get asked for their opinions? No. What is done for subs like ours that may not have a personal line to the Admins when we need it the most?

One of our moderators gets almost daily messages from a user who simply makes new alts to harass them via PM's. Despite constantly reporting it via the methods you suggest, they have no actual avenue to speak to a living, breathing person because the only people you actually listen to are powermods.

As another example. A couple of weeks ago I was incorrectly banned because of an automated mistake on the Trust and Safety teams part. This ban held for about a week because nobody on the /r/Games mod team could get in touch with an Admin.

Where are the inroads towards subs that choose not to participate in the race towards who can collect the most subs under their belt? The issue with you allowing Hate Speech-lite on Reddit is a symptom of a greater issue related to communication between Mods and Admins.

As a team you need to step away from the inner-circle of powermods that may be personal friends with Admins, and do more to get in touch with Mods who don't participate in the Sub Collector meta-game.

Subs like /r/Games, who deal with an extremely large amount of hate-speech and racism, have no avenue to actually speak about our issues because nobody on our team has the ""connections"" that powermods do.

TLDR; 'Advisory councils' feel worthless in their current form because they cater to a very specific type of moderator that many subs do not possess. Chiefly, the mods that already know Admins. If you want frank and honest conversations about your policies, you need to expand your bubble beyond them."
Games,"Hey there.

I'm not gonna distinguish myself because I'm not speaking as a mod, just a user.

The subreddits that Reddit allows to exist on their platform are disgusting. I wish they took a more proactive approach without being prodded by the media to do it. I have a generally low opinion of Reddit and the Admins who run this site, as most mods do.

Our April 1st shutdown last year was actually the only time we've ever shut the sub down. We chose not to participate in the last Reddit blackout that happened as well.

The reason for this may not be satisfactory, but we try to avoid the rest of Reddit as a whole and stay away from their drama as much as we can. Most of the mods on our sub don't even mod other subs, or if they do they are relatively small.

A lot of the larger Reddit subs are incredibly incestuous, and it's kinda become this giant circlejerk over who can be a moderator of the most subs, and it's something we've tried to stay away from.

All of that is preamble to say that we probably won't be blacking out for this latest Reddit drama, despite how many of us feel personally. We've had a long history of not getting involved in Reddit bullshit and that likely won't change now."

Thanks much for the detailed response and breakdown. It actually is appreciated. Even when I was banned I was reading your responses to Musely and it helped to know there was at least someone looking at it from the outside.

I hope the department responsible can implement the changes necessary so this doesn't happen to someone again, but I appreciate your willingness to help as much as you could regardless.

Thanks again for following up with this, it's appreciated greatly."
ModSupport,"Hey there.

I'm the mod that was banned (now lifted, because it was a mistake)

It took nearly a week for a response, and after all of that all that I got was a copy/paste ""we have reviewed your appeal and lifted the ban""

I understand you have different teams for different issues, however, whoever you have in charge of your ""Anti-Evil Operations"" team is dropping the ball hard.

The fact that a moderator of a fairly large sub can be banned for nearly a week with absolutely zero recourse when it was very obviously a mistake is ridiculous. I'm not inflating my own importance here, but it feels like there should be checks against that sort of thing, or at least a more direct avenue of communication.

Again, I know this is not your area and you probably got told to stay in your own lane when you tried to look into it, but it's stuff like this that gives A LOT of the Moderators of large subs serious issues with the Admins of Reddit.

Thank you for looking into it as much as you could. I do appreciate it. Please pass on my (and much of the /r/Games mod team, for what it's worth) complete disappointment and frustration with whoever is in charge of your Anti-Evil team."

While I cannot discuss any of our removal reasons/Automod things, I can say you should not be nervous to contact the mods of this subreddit with any issues.

Most of the people who mod /r/Games ONLY mod /r/Games, and at most maybe another smaller or similar sized sub, almost always also gaming related. We do our best to avoid powermods for many of the reasons you have mentioned already.

It's easier for the more focused subs (PS4, XB1, Switch) to have a calendar because they have a very narrow view of the field. We allow news of everything so keeping a calendar for so many things has proven to be a logistical nightmare once we sit down and try to map it out.

Lots of little things that add to the story overall and make it make a lot more sense that I was sad were missing from the movie."

If you're into Ninja Gaiden style retro/2d games with insanely tight controls and good level design, this game is a blast. It has a really fun twist a little bit into it where you swap from 8 bit to 16 bit, which changes the music/art/level designs. 

It acts as more than just a visual gimmick as swapping between the two becomes essential to progress and/or find secrets (of which there is many)

A lot of this stuff would absolutely be off topic for the sub under normal circumstances as unpopular as that may be to say. The entire HK/China situation is pretty far removed from gaming under the best of circumstances, yet this very specific incident has given it a window of relevance to /r/Games.

Once the megathread is done with, news not related to gaming will continue to be off-topic, including HK independence topics. Not because we're making a statement, but because it has nothing to do with games.

There is also currently a lot of people who want to throw in their opinion or hot take on this situation without adding anything new to it, and if we gave them all a platform our front page would quickly be overrun.

Once the megathread is down, **major** new developments related to gaming (for instance if Blizzard releases a statement) would of course be allowed, but random Youtubers giving their opinion will not."
Games,"Our general rule of thumb when allowing news is ""does this impact videogames"" and frankly for some of it, it doesn't.

It's challenging covering/allowing coverage of news like this. Everybody has a hot take or an opinion and if we allowed all of them, the front page would quickly be overrun. Doing it this way gives everything a chance to be seen without flooding our front page for people who may want to read about other news."

SCP,"If it makes you feel any better the story isn't as straightforward as it seems, like all the really great SCPs.

For one, it's labeled as a cognito-hazard which is keying you off to it not being real even in the SCP universe Canon. Someone above described it as sort of a virus which would be a great way to describe it.

Is the multiplayer still relying upon randomly finding someone if you jump into their system? (outside of joining a random game from the start menu) or are there hubs now that I just haven't found?

Overall I like it a lot, but the setting and lore isn't as good as I'm used to in Souls. It's mostly carried by solid mechanics. Also the resurrection mechanic feels completely pointless, especially the consequences of it since it is so easy to reverse."

Games,"You can actually blame this entirely on the Admin teams complete incompetency when handling issues as I'm sure any moderator of a big sub will tell you.

Our head moderator is SirkTheMonkey, voted unanimously when the previous head moderator left. However the moderator list is not ordered in any way except seniority which may or may not reflect the internal leadership of the mod team.

We wanted the list to reflect that, so we asked the Admins to reorder it for us which you'd think would be simple. Please check any archive link of our mod team list and you'll see everyone in the top 5 or 6 slots has been here for years (I've been here for 3, Sirk longer, nali longer than that).

Anyways the Admins way of reordering the list was to just fucking remove all of us and re-add us manually, something we could have done ourselves but wanted to avoid (so we contacted the Admins).

I get that conspiracy theories are all the rage now, but this sort of nonsense can be easily disproven by taking a second and looking at an archived screenshot of our mod list from any time in the last 3-5 years."
Games,"> Is this explicitly called out in the subreddit rules?

I probably should have been a bit more clear. What usually happens is we redirect people to modmail if they have questions about removals. It isn't generally how we handle things to discuss removals or actions against other posts in public.

You are right though, we should add that into the rules. We will.

You'll notice the META rule, and tag rule in general, is reserved exclusively for posts and not comments. In fact most of the rules under ""Formatting"" deal almost exclusively with posts, so it wouldn't really apply here.

While we do occasionally allow a META thread, it's been a fair bit of time since we've had one, and it's usually reserved for something noteworthy the community disagrees with that has been hanging around for awhile. 

We've had some good rule changes come about as a direct result of such threads, however while I'm just one mod here, I really don't believe an issue over a single removed post is worthy of a Meta thread, or even Meta comments.

I think you're confusing ""post"" with ""comment"". Many of the rules you cite are exclusively formatting rules intended for people who want to post a new thread on /r/Games."
Games,"Hey guys!

Most of the removed comments here are entirely about other removed comments, which is completely normal for us to remove. [Questions about removed comments should always be directed to modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGames)

Regarding the previous removed thread, we felt that while the news was definitely noteworthy (as indicated by this post which we allowed), the user who posted it added their own context to the news, which strayed too far personal crusade territory over some removed threads on a separate forum entirely which is what we deemed to fall into our ""rant"" rule.

With the PCG article, even though it links to the original post just like the post on this subreddit did, it omits any sort of rant or personal take on it and instead aims to objectively report on the news, which is all we really care about here."

I don't actually see any modmails from you about being banned and you have no notes on your account on our end which means you've never so much as been warned here.

We also don't handle moderator business inside of a PM (only in modmail, it's a very firm rule) so I'd be curious who you messaged about this.

I also see virtually no removed comments on this sub from you in the last 6 months, although oddly most of your comments seem to be complaining about various circlejerks real or imagined which kinda feels like exactly what you're complaining is filling threads.

If you just wanna be a mod, you're gonna burnout super hard. Our turnover is pretty high for a variety of reasons but I have to believe thats part of it.

The only way I've seen that you last is if you're doing something you have a passion for, in this case games. A lot of people get in and just realize it isn't for them, sometimes really fast.

None of the mods who joined when I did years back are still here, hell I don't even think any of the mods who joined the round AFTER me are still here. 

You really have to like what you're doing to mod something like this. It's just a lot of responsibility for no pay and people constantly yelling at you over a videogame."
Games,"We do this in 2 rounds usually. The first isn't meant to be incredibly hard, it's just basic stuff we use to narrow the list down. Following that we do a second round (not via google form) with more questions that require a lot more thought put into them.

With that said the form should format it ok for the most part so feel free to get as wordy as you want for this round, even though the questions are basic and easy we appreciate effort being put into it.

Yup."
Games,"This really isn't the place for it but we're down the rabbit hole now so whatever.

Gamergate is definitely not a banned topic, as shown by this discussion staying up in a **stickied mod post**.

The problem is, from my years of experience modding this place, 99% of the time when Gamergate is brought up it's in conjunction with a lot of other things that GGers don't like to admit are major talking points for them, including but not limited to:

- Harassing women 

- Doomsday conspiracy theories about how SJW's are ruining video games

- More posts than I can even count celebrating people losing their jobs because whatever video game company got shuttered that month was using ""forced diversity"" or some such nonsense.

And so much more!

The reason you see so much discussion around the issue removed is because almost all of it inevitably ends up in one of those bullet points without fail.

**This is of course all just the opinion of me and I don't speak for the rest of the mod team.**

You'd think that would be self explanatory, however that communities fondness for witch hunts and playing the victim makes it essential that I clarify that this is just me and not an entire subreddit attacking them.

pcgaming,"It took awhile to get going for me. I didn't really like how it started and I wish they went into, ironically, the origin of why he starts his quest a bit more besides super brief flashbacks.

With that said after a few hours I found myself not really caring because the actual game was so good. Exploring tombs is amazing and it's everything I wish Tomb Raider was. Even if they are kinda short, there's so many of them and it's all really well done.

Really it's best to look at it as a series relaunch instead of the next in a long line. If you go into it like an older AC game you're gonna get whiplash from how different it is and that takes a little time to get used to, but it's really fantastic when it gets going.

Even if AC Odyssey is just more Origins in a different setting I still can't wait for it now."

heroesofthestorm,"I use bladestorm just to get out of ults sometimes, it's amazing.

If you pick it just for the damage you're doing it wrong. Unstoppable for that long (or even just a split second to drop cc then you cancel it and warp away) is seriously underrated.

The damage isn't even that great without harsh winds, and even then you'll usually do way more damage meleeing someone, but everyone forgets about the unstoppable.

Illusion Master definitely has the higher skill cap, but bladestorm isn't a bad pick"

This particular game has some of the series best boss fights period. The fight against the Media boss is probably one of the best period, and the fight against the baby is really fun and creative. Also, the transitions and set pieces between the demon and human realms are insanely well done.

The story was a little on the dumb side but that's every Devil May Cry game ever. I hope it's looked back on more fondly as the years go by because it's a really solid game.

If it hadn't been called Devil May Cry and was instead it's own thing, same mechanics just different characters, it'd have probably been praised because it had a lot going for it."

Since we're not specialized into a single console, publisher or game we don't have the luxury of the extra time a lot of what you want  would require, so you may want to go elsewhere for your E3 coverage if that's what you're looking for.

We're discussing this now internally. I'm not really sure the scope of the rule would encompass video games like DBZ, and like most rule changes Reddit didn't give Mods a heads up ahead of time before pushing it through so we're all a bit in the dark here.

I'd say it would probably be overly pedantic for them to go after a fighting game and I doubt this is what the rule was intended to combat, so it's likely that this won't be an issue.

If anything changes or we come to a different conclusion we'll let the community know, but I can't personally see how this would impact discussion of games like DBZ. This is just my opinion of the matter though, if something changes like I said before we'll communicate it with you guys."

It's a hard game to recommend though. Either you're a huge JRPG fan or you aren't, and your ability to look past the flaws the game has will greatly depend on that.  I'd give it a solid 8, but I completely understand the people who have very valid complaints about it."

That's not actually what I said, and it's also factually inaccurate to say we're killing every single post about this. 

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7l75xk/bungies_latest_destiny_2_event_is_pure_greed_even/) is an article submitted  about destiny 2 RNG/Loot Boxes, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7jt3rm/kotaku_uk_gambling_commission_is_clueless_about/) is an article criticizing the UK gambling commission's knowledge on the issue, and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7jab59/uk_gambling_commission_comments_on_gambling_in/) is an article specifically mentioning their comments on it.

Those are 10 hours, 9 Days and 10 Days apart and thats with about 2 seconds of searching. We aren't curbing discussion, we're actively allowing it. What we're curbing is Youtubers who latch onto this bullshit for drama and attention. 

While I'm sure there are people who genuinely enjoy watching drama merchants that just take the hottest story and regurgitate it for their Youtube channel, that nonsense will never have a place on /r/Games unless they're actually bringing something new to the table.

> If a government rep is talking about games I don't see how that is unimportant.

I completely agree, which is why we allowed it. However a couple of his videos about the topic bring absolutely no news to this, no new legislation he's introducing or any movement on what he originally made the entire damn press conference about.

His latest video was just a video of him making cold calls to various people, how is that even remotely interesting or bringing something new to the table?


>  This stuff matters, and exercising your supervotes

I'm not really sure what you mean here. You do know that isn't how it works right? My upvote is the same as yours.

Honestly most of your post can be summed up to ""we should let the upvotes decide"" which will never happen here. We're always going to be a heavily moderated subreddit and people are always going to disagree with the decisions we make. We're fine with that.
"
Games,"This is correct.

There's a new hot take about this every few hours. I know because I've probably removed at least 20 in the last week or two from different Youtubers. If there's nothing new being said we're coming down hard on it.

Specifically regarding Chris Lee from Hawaii, he makes a new video about it every few days or so, and almost none of it is news or legislation, it's always just a call to arms that contributes nothing new to the conversation.

When something new actually happens we'll definitely allow it, but right now every Youtuber giving their opinion on it and non-updates are definitely being culled otherwise the entire sub would be overrun with people looking for clicks on the latest drama."
heroesofthestorm,"While I didn't get involved with the drama I read most of it and I think the idea (even if it was poorly executed) was to take the toxic people down a peg or two in the grand scheme of things.

The easiest way to do this is to remind them to chill out because HoTS is just a game (I'd say this about anything, even football or another sport) and getting on a pedestal and punching down at Master/Diamond people when you're a pro player is pretty silly in the bigger picture.

I definitely think it was communicated poorly by people, however I understand the intent."
Games,"This is likely my Game of the Year, or very close to it. The only other game that came close for me is probably Prey. It just has such a fantastic Silent Hill vibe that no game has really done since.

The first game was definitely an acquired taste, and it had an extremely shitty first couple of levels that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I actually completely dropped the game after a couple of hours.

I came back to it a year or two later and really gave it a shot and for some reason it stuck with me, to the point where I couldn't wait for the sequel.

The art design in Evil Within 2 is pretty amazing. The creature designs range from ""just ok"" to fantastic and there's a ton of really cool stuff in there. The art house/museum levels with the photographer really stand out to me as superb design.

I'd recommend playing it on the hardest setting. While there is definitely a learning curve at the start, you'll find the difficulty once you've skilled up some stuff to be perfect.

I'd say about half of the game is linear and half of it is open world. If you play it, be sure to fully explore the areas you're in before progressing towards the main objective as there's tons of items to find and side quests that will make the rest of the game a bit easier.

They just don't make Survival Horror games anymore, even this year only really saw 2 with RE7 and this, so when a good one comes around you owe it to yourself to give it a shot if you're a fan of the genre

heroesofthestorm,"> Heaven forbid the enemy you’re facing finds themselves in a mob of minions after 16. Explosion will boom on hitting the minion and then the arrow will hit them and end. Or another minion and boom again.

They nerfed something similar on Sylv ages ago because the damage was too insane."

Games,"Prey is a pretty great contender for my game of the year. It reminded me of the original Bioshock in all of the right ways (and by extension, System Shock)

It flew under a lot of peoples radar this year it seems which is unfortunate because the game is genuinely fantastic. Every situation has multiple ways to approach it depending on the skills you pick up throughout the game, and they're all valid.

I think the first hour or the game is pretty fantastic too as a way to get you into the world."
Games,"Xenoblade 2's soundtrack is close to on par with Xenoblade 1 for me so far, and I bought the Xenoblade 1 soundtrack from Amazon I liked it so much.

I'm not that deep into the game yet so it may get even better, but it's a huge improvement over Chronicles X so far."

Games,"Probably my favorite Tales game in a long time. After Zestiria pretty much anything was going to be better, but this far exceeded my expectations.

I think I put around 50 or 60 hours into it, finishing most of the side quests and I enjoyed pretty much all of it. The party is all fairly fleshed out story wise and fairly likable, and the skits are some of the best in the entire series.  Even if it takes Velvet awhile to come into her own and not be so emo she turned out to be a pretty good protagonist. 

There's a few fun references to Zestiria since it's set in the same world, but it's far from required to play Zestiria before you play Berseria. In fact I'd recommend skipping Zestiria altogether and just going straight to Berseria.

While it's technically a prequel, it's such a better game than Zestiria."
