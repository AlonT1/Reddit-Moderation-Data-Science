AskDocs,">This is about telling the patient that a few weeks of a intense diet can heal him completely vs. instructing him for a life as a diabetic.

I'm not sure that is true. The weight loss and dietary improvement need to be maintained, I'm not sure if this diet has proven to work if you only use it for a couple of weeks, but I'm happy to read a peer reviewed journal article. 

DM2 is a multifactorial disease with important genetic factors. If you've shown that you can develop DM2, lifestyle optimalisation will be a lifelong requirement and not a matter of a few weeks.

I am wary of diets that are both very specific (oats, for example) and promise very large benefits (cure DM2 in a couple of weeks). Nutrition is very important, but I'm not sure it should be centered around a few ingredients.

I do absolultely agree with you that there is a lot of potential lost in just telling patients to lose weight and eat better. Those things are indeed very hard to do and there is enough evidence that shows that supervised lifestyle intervention is more effective. Not all health systems are able to provide that, unfortunately."

AskDocs,">Does being semi-drunk increase the probability of contracting HIV from oral?

No.

>With him being undetectable, does it make a difference? 

Yes. Undetectable means that **he cannot transmit HIV.** Undetectable is untransmittable. That doesn't mean that he shouldn't have told you about his HIV status beforehand though, I think disclosing that is the most ethical thing to do (but I understand the stigma involved). 

>Making myself puke, does that make it better, worse, or neither? (Stupid question, I know) but I just want to know. 


I don't think it matters. The chances for HIV transmission by blowing someone and swallowing are relatively low to begin with.

>I’m still going to get tested within the next 2 months to get my answer.

Good idea. The minimal interval between potential exposure and testing might sometimes be a little shorter, depending on the test, so you could ask what interval your lab/doctor uses.

You probably don't have HIV.

If you think you're ending up having sex with guys without a condom (certainly if you're doing anal), consider pre-exposure prophylaxis."
AskDocs,"Lifestyle interventions (weight loss, more activity) are widely accepted first line treatments for impaired fasting glucose/DM2. Specific diets have less evidence, but in this oat diet the main mechanism is the same as other diets for DM2: low fat, low calorie, high complex carbohydrate.

>Total and utter moral bankruptcy of all medical personell? 

No doctor makes money from a bit of metformin. We know that patients are often unable to keep a strict low fat, low calorie, high complex carbohydrate, diet, so that might be the reason the doctor prescribed a drug as well. Getting patients to stick to an (oat based!) diet takes a lot of time, that might be a factor."

I'm not in the US, so I can't really comment on your other requirements, but at 16, you are probably able to make an appointment with your doctor? Citing irregular or absent periods seems like a very normal reason to talk to your doctor. You can always ask your parents to wait outside during your appointment, your doctor should be able to help you with that."
AskDocs,"Hmm. I usually start with candesartan (off-label in most regions) or a beta blocker.

Autoimmune (paraneoplastic) antibodies are often measured in both blood and CSF, the first one mentioned is probably the blood test. The rest are indeed in CSF.

This could be a paraneoplastic encephalitis. In a 58 year old man, lung cancer would be the most common cause."
AskDocs,"A neurological work up starts with the neurological exam; so hard to comment further,"
AskDocs,">	Okay, interesting. I thought encephalitis was a type of virus so I assumed they would have him on antibiotics if they suspected that, but I really don’t know.

Viral encephalitis is caused by a virus (often an herpes virus), but there are indeed multiple other causes of encephalitis. It just means brain inflammation.

So they are waiting on results of CSF tests: is there a bacterial or fungal infection, what type of cells are present, and are there markers for autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis.

>	Rare Mononuclear cells.” Does that mean anything?

Could be consistent with several types of inflammation of the central nervous system. The fact there is not a marked increase in white blood cells in the CSF points away from a bacterial infection."
AskDocs,"You can’t post any pictures of your genitals, but describing your problems is fine."

AskDocs,"Apparently they think he has a form of encefalitis; inflammation of the brain.

>	(I don’t know what that is, but I googled it and it looks like they’re trying to rule out cancer maybe?

It sounds like they consider an autoimmune encephalitis. Sometimes this is caused by cancer elsewhere in the body (and it is called paraneoplastic encephalitis). Work-up usually includes a scan (CT or PETCT) of the rest of the body as well."

As you found out with Google; the primary reason for the MRI is to exclude tumours that raise intracranial pressure. Tumour is a very broad term that includes relatively harmless and easily treatable problems to very serious issues. Other causes of changes to the optic nerve can also sometimes be seen on an MRI, like inflammatory diseases.

AskDocs,"I don't think this means anything. I'm not sure why the reference value for the IgG antibodies is 'detected'. It should be 'not detected' (which would be the 'normal' condition). Because your result for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is 'not detected', the EMR displays it as out of range.

They were desperately looking for any experimental or last resort treatments and arranging flights across the world. At some point in this disease it is time to concentrate on the precious time that is left with the child and not expose them on another line of treatment."

Sure, any nerve damage can cause twitching (and twitching can occur without nerve damage).  A prevous carpal tunnel syndrome can cause twitching in your abductor pollicis, it obviously cannot cause symptoms in your calf.

EMG of your biceps is not abnormal; we need more features to change before you call it abnormal.

&#x200B;

* There are no indications that euthanasia is currently performed on children 1-12 years old
* Physicians do indicate a grey area between palliative sedation and active termination of life where the borders between both acts are unclear.
* There are cases of unbearable suffering without prospect for improvement in children. Phycicians are not always able to ease this suffering.
* A limited group of parents and physicians have a need for the possibility of active termination of life in children.

I would never treat a (possibly) high grade glioma without a tissue diagnosis. Certainly not in a 52 yo with a good condition.

Radiation will slow down tumour activity (if it increases progression, why do it in the first place?)

>So biopsy is a must? **If we are opting for biopsy, shouldn't surgery be done instead if we are taking her to the operation and opening her up?**

That depends on the exact location and extent of the tumour. In some cases, an awake tumour surgery might be the best option to perform a large resection. The MRI report suggests this isn't an easy spot to do a resection.

Indeed, if a meaningful resection is possible and there is a high suspicion of a high grade glioma, I would directly go to removal and skip the biopsy. But, a MR navigated needle biopsy is much safer than a resection. 

I would suggest talking to a oncological neurosurgeon with experience in awake tumour surgery."
AskDocs,What is your question?
AskDocs,"I don't think MG would be a likely diagnosis, but I haven't examined you. Talk to your doctor."
AskDocs,">s it possible for the glioma to become high grade within a week?

No. Was this second MRI done with contrast and the previous without? Contrast enhancement can be a feature of higher grade gliomas.

>What are the feasible treatment options for the glioma?

Depends on the cell type and thus the pathological classification. If a high grade glioma is suspected, surgery to remove as much of the tumour is possible is the best initial treatment. If a meaningful resection can't be done (without damaging the patient), the next step likely is a biopsy to make sure the suspected diagnosis is correct. The tissue features also inform further treatment.

> 2. If surgery cant be done then how good is radiotherapy? (GammaKnife / CyberKnife)

Stereotactic radiosurgery (regardless if an expensive brand name is used; for high grade gliomas gammaknife or cyberknife is not proven to be a better treatment compared to regular VMAT radiation therapy) is a way to control the tumour. Depending on the cell type, this is combined or followed by chemotherapy.

>3. How is the prognosis after being diagnosed with glioma?

We cannot cure diffuse gliomas. The prognosis depends on the cell type (which is why surgery or biopsy is very important), but in diffuse gliomas, the tumour always comes back."
