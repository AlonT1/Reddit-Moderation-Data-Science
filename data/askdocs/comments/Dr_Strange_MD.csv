lancaster,"I'm a local primary care physician, and I am seeing a very concerning rise in the number of cases among my patients. It's hitting us hard, moreso now than it ever has. The hospital is getting overwhelmed."
gay_irl,"Yes, officer, this post right here."
Residency,"Bro, wait until you're an attending... What an eye opener about how much more awesome things can be."
Scrubs,"I think the moments that resonated with me the most were the moments where any of the characters felt like they were in over their heads or doubted themselves. 

There's a common phenomenon in medicine known as ""imposter syndrome,"" where despite having become a doctor and jumped through all the hoops, people think that they somehow got lucky and made it through without anyone realizing that they are not cut out for the job. They're terrified of being ""found out"" and are constantly anxious about the decisions they make and the knowledge that they have. It contributes heavily to physician burn out (among many other things).

It's something I struggled with a lot during residency, and the feeling persists even into my tenure as an attending. Despite all the safeguards and efforts that have been put into place, medical training remains one of the most brutal and dehumanizing experiences there is, which is quite contradictory to the compassionate and caring physicians that we're supposed to be. In what other field is it acceptable to work a 28 hour shift with only one hour allotted for a nap? That's not even mentioning the fact that you're making high stakes decisions throughout that entire shift. 

Luckily, I'm done with most of that now and have settled nicely into a slower paced role that gives me a pretty good work life balance, but watching Scrubs is always a bittersweet reminder for me of what came before."
lancaster,"Definitely biased because I work there, but LGH Internal Medicine is the bees knees. One of if not the most smoothly run primary care practices in Lancaster. I hear they just hired a new guy who is taking new patients.... ðŸ˜‰"
Scrubs,"As a physician, Scrubs spoke to me on such a deep and intimate level. I can tell you that fantasies and jokes aside, this is truly what medical training is like, and moments like this on the show mirror countless experiences I've had throughout the years."
Residency,"Lol, here, I filled out the paperwork for you already. Bye."
AskDocs,Nah.
AskDocs,"Yes, it's a hemorrhoid."
lancaster,"Drove by this morning, and it was quite popular! Hoping that it can help out people in the community who need it."
Residency,Hail Hydra.
lancaster,Thanks! Good to be in the neighborhood!
lancaster,"Our current porch setup, complete with giant spider fighting a centipede, lonely skeleton waiting for a date that never showed, and a cat that's very interested in the bird perched outside the window...."
davidlynch,Okay but Michael Cera in TP season 3.
Residency,Internal Medicine we all just took one ITE per year and it didn't count for anything
Residency,"Wait, people study for ITEs?

EDIT: Spelling."
Residency,I agree. I took over a small panel of patients from an NP and anyone with an A1C over 8 was referred to an endocrinologist before anything else had been done. I've had the *pleasure* of telling patients that I can handle their diabetes and that they don't have to see Endo anymore to manage their metformin.
Residency,"As a primary care internist, this warms my heart. We get dumped on far too often, and it's a real shame."
askgaybros,Congrats. Internal medicine attending here. You've got a long way to go.
Residency,"""K 3.7. Replete?"""
Residency,You're forgetting about the transfer to medicine for post-op placement. ðŸ™„
Residency,I recently inherited a small panel of patients from an NP who left the practice before I got there. Let's just say I've been making A LOT of changes.
Residency,I've been honestly shook sometimes by how fast people can drop. Had a guy go from 9.8 to 6.2 in three months after starting a combo drug.
Residency,"Name and shame while in residency seems like a pretty good recipe for a meeting with the PD and demerit for ""unprofessionalism."""
Residency,Cancer Center really be like that though.
Residency,"I can see what you mean, but at the same time, I don't have any of those things available to me as an outpatient physician. I rely heavily on history and physical exam to help me triage a patient. I agree that it's a bittersweet trade-off, and I guess I am more just disappointed that I was the only one that was really excited about this dude's exam. ðŸ˜‚"
Residency,"Yeah, and I totally get that the ED and inpatient medicine are more fast paced and leave little room for flowery documentation, but I feel like even in residency the ED residents calling me would totally geek out over hearing an S3 and would definitely mention it in their notes. Not staying that I don't think the same quality of care is there, but it's definitely an extra flourish that I didn't know I would miss.

A part of it is definitely also being on my own and not working with the same team dynamic as residency where you can immediately just talk to a colleague."
Residency,"See: https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/d2dlgv/burnt_out_on_academic_medicine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

khajiithaswares,I only recently discovered. How have I been so blind?
lancaster,Agree with all of this. Building Character is great even if you're not looking for anything in particular.
lancaster,Yes! Dr. Vu has been my dentist for almost thirty years now. I LOVE her.
Residency,K is 3.9. Replete?
AskDocs,No. The nasal spray is almost exclusively topical and acts in the nasal passages only. Only a minimal amount is absorbed and distributed systemically. It will not interact with any medications taken orally.
AskDocs,Yes.
QueerEye,Nurse Manager has entered the chat.
gay_irl,"Fire Walk With Me was seriously so traumatic. David Lynch is insane, and I love it."
gay_irl,"Okay, but no one got fucked more by depression than Laura Palmer."
Residency,"Honestly I stopped caring about this when I realized that they get far better care on a medicine service. When you think gentamicin is an appropriate first choice antibiotic for an uncomplicated UTI, then it's better that you're on medicine rather than vascular........."
Residency,"Not all men.

K."
Residency,Color me shocked that the lead author is a white male. ðŸ™„
KidsAreFuckingStupid,"Wow, you're also full of shit... Literally."
Residency,Not something I wanted to see while eating my dinner hahaha. Wow.
AskDocs,"Lol no. There are hundreds of thousands of things that can be tested for in blood. Running a blood test for ""everything"" is not only impossible but would be way too much information for us."
AskDocs,Seeing a hematogist for this seems like overkill. I am not at all concerned about a WBC of 3.
AskDocs,"Penile discharge, pain with urination, fevers, new rashes or skin lesions."
AskDocs,"Rocephin is usually given once every 24 hours, so he should start taking the Bactrim the next day at around the time that he was given the shot. That being said, it wouldn't be the end of the world if he just started taking it the morning of the next day."
AskDocs,Yes that's fine
AskDocs,Dear God do NOT do this. Only try flushing it out with water. The only person that should be sticking anything in your ears is a qualified medical professional.
AskDocs,"There's a tube that connects the ear and the throat called the Eustachian tube. This can get clogged and cause ear symptoms for people. Holding your nose and blowing forces air into the tubes and opens them up. The most common reason for the Eustachian tube to be clogged is due to mucous from allergies. I would recommend trying a daily antihistamine like Claritin, Allegra, or Zyrtec in addition to a daily nasal spray such as Flonase."
AskDocs,"Extremes in hydration can have some effect, but, again, your normal intake is fine. Vitamin C consumption doesn't really matter."
AskDocs,Almost zero.
AskDocs,Day to day dietary changes do not have a significant impact on your CBC. Chronic excesses or deficiencies are what can change your CBC. Just eat and drink as you normally would.
AskDocs,Yes.
AskDocs,Topiramate would be my next go to if propranolol wasn't working out for you. It's an antiepileptic that is commonly used for migraine prophylaxis.
AskDocs,They're neither healthy or unhealthy; they're just normal.
AskDocs,"Having angina at your age is exceedingly uncommon. Furthermore, aspirin does not really help with typical anginal pain but rather helps in the event of a heart attack."
AskDocs,You can wait.
AskDocs,"Yes, this is very common."
AskDocs,I would say you're being overly cautious. Fluticasone is an incredibly safe medication that has an anaphylaxis rate that is close to 0%.
AskDocs,You need to go to the emergency department since this infection seems to be progressing rapidly despite antibiotics.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,It looks like you may be developing an early infection. Draining it yourself with your nails was not a good idea. You may need a short course of antibiotics.
AskDocs,Fleeting pain that has subsided for the most part is not consistent with torsion.
lancaster,"As a Vietnamese person, I have to agree with other users that Pho Pasteur on Columbia Ave at Rohrerstown Road is the best pho."
gay,"We actually bought the house during the pandemic. Closing was definitely a much different experience than normal, but our realtor and lender were both great. Glad it's over now. ðŸ˜Œ"
AskDocs,"It depends on how bloody we are talking. Is it just when you wipe? Mixed with the stool? Blood without stool? It's not uncommon for hemorrhoids to bleed and for you to see blood on the tissue when you wipe or a small amount in the bowl. You can use over the counter remedies for this such as Preparation H. If you're having a lot of bleeding, have black/sticky/tarry stools, or are feeling faint or otherwise symptomatic, then you should seek more urgent medical care."
AskDocs,This is just chemical irritation. Always use gloves when using harsh chemicals such as hair bleaching solution.
AskDocs,"If the erection went away, then you're fine."
AskDocs,Unlikely.
AskDocs,"IUD strings often go missing. This is not a big deal. If your IUD is still in place, then everything is fine. Taking it out and putting another one in may do more harm than good."
AskDocs,You absolutely do not need to go the EMERGENCY department to have a mostly asymptomatic lump that has been there for a month checked out. Please schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor.
AskDocs,"You're going to have to be much more specific. What is the exact number, and what are the other lab values?"
AskDocs,"It may be that she is having worsening of her old stroke symptoms called rescrudescence. This can be caused by a number of things, but infection is one of them. I would have her seen in the emergency department."
AskDocs,"Aside from the obvious physical damage that can be done to both your hands and the wall, this type of behavior is extremely concerning and is an inappropriate way of expressing anger. It is not normal for someone to be punching walls out of anger multiple times a week."
AskDocs,These can be done non-fasting.
AskDocs,"If this is a significant change from her baseline, then this is quite possibly something that requires emergent evaluation. Another stroke is not out of the question."
AskDocs,"Differin (adapalene) is available over the counter in the US and other countries. Use it once nightly (it's inactivated by sunlight) and apply a moisturizer on top since it can be somewhat drying. Most acne treatments require weeks to work, so you will likely not see results right away. Don't be discouraged, and just keep going.

ETA a little goes a long way. You only have to apply a thin layer to the face. Use about a pea size."
AskDocs,"This seems a bit dismissive. I think some concern is warranted especially considering a lot of new evidence in recent years that has caused the IDSA to dial back on recommending fluoroquinolones as first line treatment for many infections, including UTIs. There are many safer alternatives, and it is completely within a patient's right to explore options for other treatment modalities with their physician if they are uncomfortable with the current prescription."
AskDocs,"Fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin do have scary side effects but are generally safe for short courses. If you're still uncomfortable, it would be reasonable to ask your doctor for alternatives. Other commonly used antibiotics for outpatient treatment of UTIs include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cefdinir."
AskDocs,"Talk to your doctor and explain the situation. Depending on the extent of the inflammation, they may prescribe either an as needed high potency topical steroid or a very short bursts of oral steroids."
AskDocs,"The anus is not physiologically made for penetration, so it is not uncommon for there to be pain with the initial insertion, especially if you are not preparing adequately and using appropriate lubrication. When engaging in any sort of anal penetration, it is extremely important to go slowly and use plenty of lubrication. Going too fast, too large, or forcing penetration can cause things like anal tears and fissures which can sometimes be hard to treat."
AskDocs,"Anemia is not always due to iron deficiency, and taking supplemental iron without an established deficiency does not provide much benefit. You need to have a more detailed history taken and also additional lab work done to determine what the cause is. A hemoglobin of 9.8 is not an emergency and can wait for a regular appointment."
Residency,"Yeah, that's what I hear from everyone who has taken it, but it's still demoralizing when you're going through and haven't a clue with some of these questions."
AskDocs,The guidelines specifically state that this applies to hysterectomy with removal of the cervix. This patient still has her cervix.
AskDocs,A single lesion on the lip alone is not something that would indicate this diagnosis. This is a strongly inherited disorder that is relatively uncommon. People usually present with multiple episodes of bleeding and many characteristic lesions.
AskDocs,"As long as you haven't been taking the medication inappropriately, it is not uncommon for patients to request additional pain medications post operatively. Obviously it is up to the physician to prescribe, but it does not seem unreasonable."
AskDocs,Definitely hemorrhoids. Fiber and stool softeners can often cause cramping and gas.
AskDocs,"""Sleeping pills"" is incredibly nonspecific and can encompass a number of medications. You need to identify a specific drug in order to determine whether or not it's safe in G6PD deficiency. There are well established lists that your physician or pharmacist can reference."
AskDocs,"B12 has a wide normal range, and a number in the 1000s is not something I normally care about. The test result itself can also vary greatly depending on your diet. Unless there is specifically something else going on in terms of symptoms or other abnormal lab work, a high B12 is not something to be concerned about. B12 is almost exclusively checked to look for low levels."

lancaster,"Trust me, I will definitely wear a mask!"
lancaster,You are a saint. Thank you so much.
lancaster,Noted. Clearing out my Wednesday schedule. ðŸ˜­
AskDocs,Thanks for the update. I'm glad that you were able to use this information in a meaningful way.
lancaster,"Thanks! That's what I thought, but I didn't want to show up and be sent away because I hadn't been seen by an eye doctor."
Residency,Ok boomer.
Residency,"Internal medicine. Family medicine to some extent, but if your intent is hospital medicine, then internal medicine is 100% the best route."
Residency,Praise Satan.
askgaybros,About to be an attending in a month. You're in for a wild ride.
AskDocs,"This discussion is beyond the scope of this subreddit both due to it's apparent complexity and the inability for OP to provide any specific details about prior diagnoses, medications, or workup. 

Locking thread."
AskDocs,You don't need antibiotic ointment. Vaseline is perfectly fine. Just keep it clean and covered. Avoid scrubbing. It looks like it's in the beginning stages of healing.
AskDocs,These symptoms are consistent with acid reflux. It is extremely common and for many people can be quite severe. Esophageal cancer in someone your age is exceedingly rare.
AskDocs,I think continuing and having the dose increased if needed is a reasonable course of action. I should also note that therapy combined with medications works better than either does alone. I would strongly encourage you to find a therapist of you aren't already seeing one.
AskDocs,Do you wear high heels?
AskDocs,The absorption of topical Vitamin D through the skin is on the order of less than 5 percent. You're fine.
AskDocs,"SSRIs take up to 6-8 weeks to have a full effect. The fact that you're improving already is good. There is also a lot of room to go up on doses of SSRIs. I will say that I have had patients who have done well on one SSRI versus another, so I do think there is some utility in trial and error, but this is a long process that requires months of medication titration."
AskDocs,"I wouldn't say it's exactly ""normal"" per say, but this is not an uncommon nervous habit that many people have."
Residency,"I have had a handful of interactions with rapid response/code nurses that I cannot for the life of me understand. The biggest offender being in a code situation where I come in and clearly identify myself as the code leader. I'm running the code when all of a sudden the code nurse yells ""WHO IS RUNNING THIS CODE?"" and I'm like ""Me."" And he replies ""WELL THEN YOU NEED TO STAND HERE!"" and I'm just like sure whatever and move to that spot. He then looks me in the eye and TURNS THE ZOLL MONITOR AWAY FROM ME so that I can't see the rhythm tracing anymore. I was flabbergasted. Luckily the primary team showed up and took over and I peaced the eff out of there. What a jerk."
AskDocs,"This is almost certainly synovial fluid (joint fluid) or fluid from the bursa, which is the cushioning around your knee. Fluid around the joint following an injury is not uncommon and is often expected. Something this far out may need further workup, but unless you are experiencing severe swelling, redness, warmth, or severe pain, this is a non urgent issue that can be addressed by your orthopedist. 

It is EXTREMELY dangerous to perform such a drainage on your own at home in a non-sterile environment and can result in severe joint infections and sepsis that at worst can lead to destruction of the joint and death if not promptly treated. If you begin developing worsening swelling, redness, warmth, pain, fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, or dizziness, please go immediately to the hospital."
AskDocs,Post sufficiently answered. Thanks all for contributing. Locking.
AskDocs,Color me shocked that this turned into a giant internet war about chiropractors. OP has received sufficient input from a verified neurosurgeon. Locking.
Residency,"About to finish residency, close on my dream house, and start a wonderful job doing what I love in my hometown. This is the moment my husband and I have been waiting for... For our lives to actually start. To say that I'm happy is an understatement."
AskDocs,"Welp, this is going nowhere. Locking."
Residency,"As the day senior, I always interrupt the attending to dismiss the post call residents. If they've got a problem with it, I welcome them to speak to my program director who loses her shit when residents break duty hours."
Residency,"I had an Ortho intern who demanded a full medicine consult for a patient because he didn't know how to put in the order set for sliding scale insulin. He literally told me ""I need a med con. This patient has diabetes, and I want to put them on sliding scale insulin."" I offered to walk him through it or put the orders in myself but he insisted on the consult. I asked to speak to his chief and he hung up so fast."
xmen,Professor Xavier is a jerk!
Residency,Got a big signing bonus last year so I ended up only getting like $300 ðŸ˜‚
Residency,"""I was outside with no panties on and my vaginal touch some not so clean things

Residency,My residency program has a similar message and has sent out several emails saying that we should under NO circumstances see patients without the proper PPE. I am so proud to be at a program that cares about us.
TooAfraidToAsk,I highly doubt there will be any pay raises.
TooAfraidToAsk,Apologies. Must be the 80 hour work weeks and sleep deprivation getting to me.
TooAfraidToAsk,I'm glad you think me going to work as a doctor in the hospital and risking my life is exciting. Good for you.
AskDocs,Likely requires antibiotics.
AskDocs,Likely bacterial vaginosis. This is a common problem. Also maybe a urinary infection. An STD is also not out of the realm of possibility. You need formal testing to be sure.
AskDocs,"This is likely a dictation error. They probably meant ""normal."""
AskDocs,Please stop posting about this wound.
AskDocs,These rhythms are fatal unless promptly corrected. A device that detects it without shocking you right away is pointless because you'll likely be dead by the time help arrives. Leaving it up to your partner to coordinate getting help while you're lying there pulseless and dead is honestly cruel.
AskDocs,"This is an exceedingly poor idea. While it is true that younger individuals are faring better, there are definitely cases of catastrophic complications in this population, including respiratory distress requiring intubation and intensive care."
AskDocs,"If you truly have pneumonia (i.e., a long infection caused by bacteria) then Mucinex is not an appropriate treatment. You need antibiotics."
AskDocs,Direct messaging a physician on this subreddit is against the rules and is grounds for an immediate ban. Consider this a warning. You have been advised by multiple physicians at this point that your risk for developing tetanus from a minor wound such as this is extremely low. Locking thread.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,"Dude, calm down. You're going to be fine. It is highly unlikely that a wound this minor is going to be of any significance. You're due for a tetanus booster on a non emergent basis, but that has nothing to do with this scrape."
AskDocs,"Inpatient admission is typically not warranted unless you are actively a harm to yourself or others, which is obviously not the case here."
AskDocs,A bleeding lesion like an ulcer or vascular malformation somewhere in the GI tract is the most common cause.
AskDocs,"Not every physician will feel comfortable doing this, but I think that most people will, especially if you are having full on panic attacks when you get your blood drawn. Make sure you have someone to take you to and from the appointment, since these medications can impair your driving ability."
AskDocs,"Vomiting blood and having bloody bowel movements? He's got a GI bleed. Period. If they cannot find it on upper or lower endoscopy, then the bleed is likely in the small intestine, which is inaccessible via traditional means of endoscopy. He needs to be transferred to a facility that has the capability to do advanced endoscopy or capsule endoscopy."
AskDocs,This looks completely normal.
AskDocs,It's not going to go away on its own. You need to get it drained plus/minus antibiotics.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,Lol no.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,Avascular actually makes it less likely to be malignant since most cancers establish their own blood supply to grow themselves. A lipoma does not typically have it's own vascular supply.
AskDocs,These labs are pretty boring and nothing to worry about. The more concerning things are your drinking and smoking.
premed,"To be fair, it's not uncommon for ID docs to call down to the lab and request that they test for a certain bacteria using whatever media."
AskDocs,Lack of sex does not do this.
AskDocs,Your father is not causing any significant risk to you and your family. Him wearing a mask at home does absolutely nothing. It's laughable that you think you know better than your father who is an infectious diseases specialist.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,Lol no.
AskDocs,"The best I can think of is taking the Aleve scheduled throughout the day to head off the pain. It's not ideal, but a few days of antiinflammatory around the clock is typically well tolerated."
AskDocs,"Not really, no."
AskDocs,"Definitely have a frank conversation with your doctor about it and discuss the potential risks. It's certainly not out of the realm of possibility for you to become pregnant, but it does increase your risk for complications, and you will need to be monitored more frequently. There is also a chance that a surgeon will take your case given your circumstances."
AskDocs,"I personally would never even consider doing this, and I do not think any other physician would consider it either. Toradol does come in an oral formulation, but it's often expensive and not covered by insurance."
AskDocs,Ask your doctor for a small dose of an anxiety medication to take right before getting blood work.
AskDocs,"Not a problem. You're in kind of a tough spot since your lesion is right on the border. If you do get pregnant, it's important to divulge this information to your care team so that they can closely monitor the lesion throughout the pregnancy."
AskDocs,"Food is broken down at various points during ingestion and then moves through a series of valves, often not all at once. It then moves through the GI tract by a series of squeezing movements. All of these cause you to have separate fragments of stool."
AskDocs,"Usually greater than 5 cm is a general guideline surgeons go by or if the lesion becomes symptomatic, but there are many other factors to consider. You're obviously right on the border, so I think it's prudent you hold off on getting pregnant for now so that you can see where the lesion is going. Oral contraceptives can make the lesions bigger, and most women will be taken off of them if they have a hepatic adenoma. Maintaining a healthy body weight is also important, so exercise is encouraged."
AskDocs,There is virtually no way to tell if you have hyperkalemia without blood work. Palpations and shortness of breath are not even remotely specific to hyperkalemia and can be caused by a whole host of things.
AskDocs,"These are not at all concerning. The reference values are there as a general guide and are often lab specific with different higher and upper limits depending on where you're getting blood work done. In truth, we often see people who fall out of the ""normal range"" who are completely fine. This is just the nature of having an incredibly diverse human population."
AskDocs,"Many times, removing these is more trouble than it's worth, which is why we often wait to see how it changes over time. A surgery like this is not exactly low risk. 5 cm generally a safe size to have with low risk of bleeding or malignant transformation."
AskDocs,It is highly unlikely that you have internal damage from this.
AskDocs,"It simply means there was nothing in there (i.e., stool or air) when the scan was done."
AskDocs,It is common for people to have bowel movements that are not one continuous piece. There is nothing abnormal about this.
AskDocs,These symptoms are incredibly nonspecific and do not really point one way or the other towards diabetes.
AskDocs,This is not high.
AskDocs,There is no issue.
AskDocs,You may find [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ffh3bf/24f_54_170lbs_chronic_bacterial_vaginosis_for_9/) helpful....
AskDocs,Post sufficiently answer. Locking comments.
AskDocs,Unlikely.
AskDocs,"Not much. By objective data, I mean you need lab work and possibly imaging."
AskDocs,"There's not nearly enough information to make even an educated guess. ""Suspicious lymph nodes"" is a vague description at best. Hopefully your doctor has some some basic blood work to look at your counts. If your counts are normal, it is less likely a hematologic malignancy like lymphoma. Hopefully the ENT will be able to give you more information."
AskDocs,"Impossible to say without more objective data. It sounds pretty severe, though, and I would recommend being evaluated at the hospital."
AskDocs,"Yes, in general, if you're able to get your diabetes under control and haven't had any permanent damage yet then it will be fine. Diabetics in general have an overall higher risk for cardiovascular disease, but that is just the nature of the disease. Keeping your A1C low will minimize these risks as you get older."
AskDocs,Low risk.
AskDocs,"Treating OCD often involves a combination of medications and therapy that you can't do on your own. Again, I'm not saying you have OCD, but there are definitely features here that could be consistent with it. As far as telling your parents, it's just something you're going to have to do. This is clearly causing a lot of distress in your life, and it will only get worse if you leave it be. If you want to keep it vague, maybe just see if they'll schedule an appointment for you to see your pediatrician for issues concentrating."
AskDocs,"This could possibly be OCD, but I'm honestly not 100% sure. You should be evaluated by a psychiatrist."
AskDocs,"Yes, this is normal. If you're using oxymetolazone or phenylephrine nasal spray, these should not be used for more than three days at a time as they can cause rebound congestion. You can prevent your nose from bleeding by using a humidifier in your home and also using just a saline nasal spray."
AskDocs,It takes years and years of uncontrolled diabetes to do real damage. The good news is that young patients who get control over their diabetes tend to do well. Just continue to follow your endocrinologist's instructions.
AskDocs,Nah they just make you hella constipated.
AskDocs,"No.... There are arteries everywhere in your body that will pulsate, not just your wrist..."
AskDocs,"Strep throat can be extremely uncomfortable, and what you're describing is not uncommon. On top of the antibiotics, I would take an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen around the clock for the swelling and pain. You can take up to 800 mg at a time every eight hours. You may take Tylenol on top of that for the fevers. If it still isn't better after another 24 hours, then I would go to get reevaluated."
AskDocs,"It is certainly a possibility, and you are correct in going to get evaluated by your doctor."
AskDocs,"There is no way to calculate this risk from the scenario that you have provided. If you have questions about your fertility, it is best to see your doctor for evaluation."
AskDocs,Post has been sufficiently answered and has devolved into a pointless internet debate about COVID. Locking.
AskDocs,You have an active hepatitis B infection. Period. The blood work is very clear cut.
AskDocs,These results are consistent with an active hepatitis B infection.
AskDocs,"Okay, folks, this is getting out of hand with the advice from unverified users. OP has received sufficient advice about needing to see a psychiatrist. Locking."
Residency,"I just Google their insurance and ""formulary."""
AskDocs,"Obviously I'm not going to convince you otherwise over Reddit if you're going to go down the drug company conspiracy route. All I can say is that in my personal experience and the experience of countless other physicians around the world, these drugs have been lifesaving for patients and many would gladly take the side effects any day over going back to their anxiety and depression. All medications have side effects. Period. It's unavoidable, and paychiatric medications are particularly difficult because they deal with brain chemistry. There will always be a small but vocal population of people that make a ruckus about it on the internet. The people that have benefited from the drugs and got their lives back are out there living it and not creating conspiracy websites on the internet. Trust that your doctor is doing what he/she thinks is right for you."
Residency,"Patient population and ancillary staff mostly. Resident clinics are filled with train wreck noncompliant patients that are following up from their twenty medical problem hospitalization. In the community, you see relatively normal people that actually give a damn at least a little about their health."
AskDocs,"You could go back to your PCP to address this or be referred to a specialist depending on their comfort level with the issue. Bupropion, which is another antidepressant, is commonly used to combat the effects of SSRI induced sexual dysfunction."
AskDocs,"It's rare, and it is heavily debated. I myself am not completely sure it's a real side effect either, but there are definitely case reports. There's no black box warning because the incidence is extremely low, and there is insufficient evidence to say that SSRIs cause this. It's hard to tease out permanent sexual dysfunction from recurrent depressive symptoms which in itself can cause sexual dysfunction."
AskDocs,They should fade with time. Things like stretch marks from weight gain may linger on for longer since they are an indirect effect from the weight gain rather than the medication itself.
AskDocs,"It's completely possible that he's never had someone with permanent dysfunction. I've never had a patient with permanent sexual dysfunction. When I say a small minority, I do truly mean that it's a rare occurrence that most people shouldn't worry about."
AskDocs,"Fluoxetine has a looooooong half life and can take weeks to fully washout. Because of this, many people do not feel any symptoms from coming off of it. Sexual side effects from SSRIs go away with discontinuation of the drug after several weeks in the majority of patients. A small minority may have lingering effects that can be more long term. Only time will tell how you respond."
AskDocs,This ultrasound is completely normal. Ovary sizes are within normal limits.
AskDocs,"You need to get treated for your depression. Period. It's extremely common, and a doctor is not going to stigmatize you for being depressed. They may be able to write a note for you, but it's ultimately up to the professor to decide what to do with that letter."
AskDocs,"This is a very benign appearing mole. If it's bothering you that much, it's not an issue for the dermatologist to just take it off."
AskDocs,Has your partner had prior sexual partners? HPV can be latent for years before becoming symptomatic.
AskDocs,"Tumor marker tests are not the most reliable tests for diagnosing cancer. If an ENT has physically taken a look at the area and not identified a suspicious lesion, then it is unlikely there is a cancer there that would be causing your symptoms. It is more likely that there is a non cancer reason for your symptoms."
AskDocs,"The vast majority of ENT cancers are associated with smoking. As a nonsmoker, the chance that you have one at this young of an age is exceedingly low."
AskDocs,You most certainly do NOT have diabetes from having LOW blood sugar after fasting for two days.
AskDocs,"Oh, I'll say hi alright."
doctorsthatgame,I've played a few of the past iterations and they've all been fantastic.
Residency,"That's awesome. Our Cancer Center has someone that does it, but our other units and the resident clinics are not as fortunate."
doctorsthatgame,Yes! I'm extremely excited.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,No. Extremely low risk.
AskDocs,"It depends on the size, but it could take a few days. By the end of a week, it should be almost completely healed if it's small."
AskDocs,"There's never zero chance. Any wound has a chance of becoming infected, but it is relatively low for an injury like this. Just make sure to keep it clean and dry. Put a small bandaid over it if possible."
AskDocs,"Hard to tell from just the photo, but it looks like a pimple. Highly unlikely a tick bite unless you're running naked through wooded areas with ticks."
AskDocs,"Unless it's huge and continuing to bleed, you'll be fine. It will heal like any other small cut or scrape. Avoid aggressive scrubbing in the future."
AskGayMen,"Do you mean you ""couldn't care less?"""
AskDocs,"Metamucil is a popular brand and comes in a dissolvable powder or capsules. Either is effective. There are also numerous other brands/generics, but the key is finding something with ""psyllium husk"" in it. Be aware that a sudden increase of fiber in your diet may cause some bloating and gassiness in the first few days, but this should subside. I would also recommend separating any medications that you take several hours away from when you take your fiber, as it can significantly affect absorption of medications."
Residency,"I would recommend a private practice elective if you're still interested in outpatient medicine. While I do enjoy my resident clinic experience, seeing primary care in ""the real world"" is like night and day."
AskDocs,It's an overgrowth of skin that's generally benign. It usually stays forever unless removed surgically.
AskDocs,"I put the possibility out there considering that the rest of your post indicates some high risk activity and that it also might explain some of your symptoms. Viral hepatitis for example, which is highly endemic in Vietnam, can be sexually transmitted and is quite prevalent among sex workers. Not only do I see this on occasion in people that travel to Southeast Asia, I'm also Vietnamese, so I'd like to think that I'm just being complete by bringing up the possibility and not a racist ""boomer.""

Also, it's a myth that only ""alcoholics"" can experience withdrawal. Plenty of heavy drinkers can also experience it, and while most withdrawal does occur within 24-48 hours, it can also happen later than that and last for weeks."
Residency,"I love clinic!!! Going into primary care, so definitely a little biased...."
IAmA,"Dr. Gordon, I'm a PGY-3 internal medicine resident who will be starting a wonderful primary care job in a few months when I graduate. Coming from an IM background, we get very sparse training and education on contraception and reproductive health. It is by far my weakest area of practice, and I find myself deferring to gynecology for those issues. Are there any helpful resources you would recommend that are geared towards providers?"
AskDocs,Daily fiber supplement can give people the cleanest poops of their lives.
AskDocs,"What you are doing is binge drinking, and this has not only long term effects on height but also brain function, liver health, and also a variety of other things."
AskDocs,"This is called ""rectal prolapse."" You need to be evaluated by a surgeon. These can lead to complications down the line, especially if you're having it at such a young age."
AskDocs,"A dose that small is likely not having any real physiological effect at all, and the effects you are having are likely placebo."
AskDocs,"Yes, absolutely."
AskDocs,"Either a hemorrhoid or a skin tag. Either way, no doctor is going to care looking at your butt. We've seen far worse."
AskDocs,"That tooth is dead and needs to be pulled by a dentist. If you're looking not to be judged harshly, the clinic associated with a dental school in your area might be a good place to start since they often see underinsured or uninsured patients with similar dental complaints."
AskDocs,Invasive candidiasis is generally rapidly progressive and oftentimes fatal if not treated. It is highly unlikely/impossible that you have had such an infection for the past few years.
AskDocs,Stone cold normal.
AskDocs,Yes.
AskDocs,"I've seen people that function perfectly normally on prednisone and others that are sensitive to side effects. I would say see how it goes for you after the first week. If you're okay, I would think it would be okay to resume working. Six months sounds incredibly unreasonable to be honest."
AskDocs,"If you had a DVT, it's an urgent issue, and you would absolutely hear about it within 24-48 hours."
AskDocs,This sounds like it started as a simple viral infection but given the shortness of breath with exertion and increased mucous may be a sign of early pneumonia. You're going to have to bite the bullet and be seen either in an urgent care/ER or by your primary care doctor. You should absolutely not take a medication that has been prescribed to someone else.
AskDocs,"Given everything you've said, I'm concerned that this is alcohol withdrawal. I would go to the ER to be evaluated and possibly undergo either an outpatient or inpatient detox. You might also need testing for sexually transmitted diseases if you were having intercourse with prostitutes in Vietnam. Alcohol withdrawal can be very dangerous and can progress to seizures and death."
AskDocs,The short answer is yes.
AskDocs,Just eat and drink as much as you would normally unless you start feeling nauseated or sick.
AskDocs,You might feel sick for the next day or so but should be fine after that.
AskDocs,"It's not uncommon nowadays for a lot of GI docs to use a ""top down"" sort of approach where they start with biologics to get initial control of the disease and then move down to less intensive treatments once someone reaches a more steady state in their symptoms. In my experience, patients who take a non-pharmalogical approach to their Crohn's tend to not have much improvement in their symptoms or relapse very early and more frequently."
AskDocs,"Absolutely not. Furthermore, there have been long term studies showing that smoking marijuana during pregnancy can lead to developmental delays and issues with intellectual disability down the line."
Residency,"Jokes on you, the patient left AMA two hours ago to go drink and is already back in the ED ""requesting detox."""
AskDocs,Having high muscle mass can definitely elevate your creatinine. Creatinine is a waste product of muscle breakdown and is an indirect measure that we use to evaluate kidney function.
medicine,"Yes, I'm at a quaternary care center with a major trauma center. Our medical ICU is a closed unit with 29 beds and one of the highest APACHE II scores in the region. We frequently get transfers from other ICUs in the state when things get too much for them. Even if there was no in house attending, they would probably get called in 6 out of 7 nights in a week. It's just more practical to have a dedicated night ICU attending to staff admissions, supervise the fellow with advanced procedures, and oversee management of acutely decompensating patients. Not only that, but I think it helps tremendously with resident wellness and also education."
medicine,"I'm at a program where there is an ICU fellow AND attending in house 24/7. It blows my mind that a PGY-2 is the highest level of care overnight.

EDIT: You did everything correctly within your scope of practice. The hospital failed you by putting you in this position, but you 100% did not fail this patient."
medicine,"Patient tried to set me up with her granddaughter because I'm so ""handsome and successful."" Couldn't bare to break her heart and tell her that I'm A) married and B) gay."

DivinityOriginalSin,"Wait, why am I attracted to a demon man though."
AskDocs,"Honestly, I would see if your doctor would be willing to prescribe a small dose of an anxiolytic like Ativan or Xanax for the few times you have to go get blood. It sounds like you're having panic attacks when getting blood drawn."
premed,PGY-3. So am I God then?
AskDocs,"I cannot stress enough that you should NOT do this. Liquid medications meant for ingestion are not safe to inject and may cause more harm. Furthermore, if anyone catches wind that you're injecting your oral medications, this will lead to serious consequences for being prescribed pain medications in the future.

You need to talk to your oncologist about your symptoms. They will figure out a way to control your nausea and pain."
AskDocs,"This isn't what you want to hear, but you need to go to the hospital like your psychiatrist recommended. You are having an acute psychotic episode and need to be evaluated for possible admission to get things under control."
AskDocs,"Most animal bites require antibiotics since they can often lead to infections. Unless things get rapidly worse, you can wait until your appointment tomorrow."
AskDocs,"Yes, but there can be other reasons as well that are not related to anxiety. If you're worried about it, it's best to see your doctor for an evaluation."
AskDocs,"Therapy is definitely what you should be doing. There are therapists that deal specifically with sexual trauma, so I would start there.

TheSimpsons,"As I get older, I identify with Marge Simpson more and more."
AskDocs,There is little to no interaction between a topical antibiotic and alcohol.
AskDocs,You can take ibuprofen or another over the counter pain medication. Vick's or another similar menthol topical treatment may also be helpful.
AskDocs,"If it's limiting your activities this far out, I would get it checked out."
AskDocs,"I think a brief hug should be okay, but everyone should be making sure they are washing their hands thoroughly. I don't know that she should be holding a baby or anything. Being around pregnant women should be fine."
AskDocs,"The infection is spread through the fecal-oral route, which means that stool particles that are ingested can spread the infection. As such, she should avoid handling food or beverages that will be served to anyone else. Both she and any guests should be washing their hands with SOAP AND WATER to prevent spread. Hand sanitizer will not cut it here."
AskDocs,I almost always call patients with imaging results whether normal or not. Many other physicians do this as well.
AskDocs,Eosinophils are just a sub-type of white blood cell. There's nothing to worry about if it is within the normal range.
AskDocs,This honestly sounds like a million dollar workup for no reason.
AskDocs,She has an infection. She was prescribed antibiotics. The infection will get better. Period.
AskDocs,OP's question has been sufficiently answered. Locking as this is devolving into chaos...
AskDocs,Eustachian tube dysfunction.
AskDocs,"This is likely hemorrhoidal bleeding. Hemorrhoids are enlarged blood vessels in the anus/rectum that can happen when there is a lot of pressure on the area, such as when people strain to have a bowel movement. It is a common problem and is the most common cause of bleeding from the rectum by far. Colon cancer in a 22 year old is highly unlikely."

AskDocs,Normal.
AskDocs,A pulse ox that low for that long is not compatible with life. Your monitor is wrong.
AskDocs,The vast majority of tendon issues happen in the elderly taking these medications. A short course for a UTI in a young healthy patient is safe.
AskDocs,Probably related. Will go away with some R&R. Would recommend ibuprofen 600 mg up to three times daily as needed. Heat will help to relax the muscle.
AskDocs,"It's not uncommon that people with this condition grind their teeth at night, so you may want to invest in a night guard."
AskDocs,Make sure your seat is adjusted so that your are looking at the screen straight on without having to bend or flex your neck. Take frequent breaks to stretch away from the computer.
AskDocs,"Honestly, your leg does not look like it has the best blood flow, and a wound like that could get nasty quickly. And by nasty, I mean something that would require amputation. I would have this evaluated as soon as possible."
AskDocs,Nah. You're good.
AskDocs,Excessive sweating in the night can be normal for some people but can also be a sign of other things that would be ruled out. I would see your doctor with this complaint so that they can run tests to rule out some of the more concerning diagnoses such as thyroid issues or a hematologic problem.
AskDocs,"This sounds like TMJ syndrome. Acute flares can be managed conservatively with anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen. I would try ibuprofen 600 mg every eight hours as needed to help with the pain. Applying heat can also help to relieve tension in the area. Keep on top of the pain for a few days, and it should help."
AskDocs,"Muscular pain is extremely common, and the vast majority will resolve spontaneously within several days. Neck pain is not a usual presenting symptom of stroke, so you can rest easy there. Common causes of neck pain including exercise, excessive screen time (computer, TV, phone, etc.), or poor neck support at bedtime."
AskDocs,Yes.
AskDocs,There are no life threatening issues associated with this switch.
AskDocs,"Ambien is a dirty drug with lots of side effects, high chance for developing dependence, and has some drug interactions. I never prescribe it."
AskDocs,You'll be fine. I would avoid the combination in the future. Melatonin is a far safer over the counter option for sleep and has few drug interactions.

medicalschool,Jesus. I went on six interviews and thought that was more than enough...
AskDocs,Soreness usually lasts anywhere from 24-72 hours. It's completely normal.

Residency,"Oh, most definitely."
Residency,This.
Residency,"Here's our secret: Experience, clinical reasoning, and common sense. 

There's no magical resource that will give you answers. 

The main things you want to answer for most every patient are: 
1. What is happening?
2. Why do you think it's happening? This part should address any life threatening and ""cannot miss"" diagnoses.
3. What else can you do to clarify what's happening or confirm your diagnosis?
4. What are you going to do about it?

For your anemic patient, for example...
1. They're anemic and likely having symptomatic anemia.
2. Are they bleeding? Anything from your H&P that suggests active bleeding? Are they stable or do they need a massive transfusion and emergent intervention?
3. Get some anemia labs. Possibly imaging if your exam suggests you need it.
4. Transfuse the patient. Lab frequency will depend on the situation. Are they actively bleeding? If yes, then you'll probably want to check a CBC more frequently. Maybe every six to eight hours depending on how stable they are. No bleeding at all? You're probably just good checking a post-transfusion and monitoring clinically.

Nobody expects you to be perfect this early. Seeing and doing will help you develop more clinical reasoning and confidence."
medicalschool,"Meanwhile, when I send the students home...

""Are you sure there isn't anything else I can help with?""

Edit: spelling"
AskDocs,"These are all parameters having to do with how the cells look and their size. I honestly don't find them helpful, except for the MCV, which can sometimes help identify vitamin deficiencies or other more rare blood disorders. That being said, your hemoglobin is normal, so I would not be worried."
AskDocs,"To my knowledge, there are no known adverse effects of a high folate level. It probably just means your diet is high in folate."
medicalschool,"Nah, man.

AskDocs,You can continue to see your other doctors. I would just have them make sure they send their notes to your PCP at their new location
AskDocs,You have to specifically look for syphilis in blood. Same thing goes with any other laboratory test. Just because they have blood does not mean they run every test under the sun.
medicalschool,Bitch please. I'm still in bed when y'all pre-rounding on your patients.
Residency,"Yes, absolutely. Uncomplicated HIV is completely within the realm of a primary care physician who cares enough to learn about it."
AskDocs,Image link broken. Removing.
AskDocs,"First, there is no question being asked here. Second, it is highly unlikely that the government is trying to kill you. Removing post."
AskDocs,"Yes, it can wait until tomorrow, but, in the meantime, stay off the foot completely. Elevate and ice as much as you can. If it gets worse, then be seen sooner rather than later."
AskDocs,"It depends on the provider. Some are perfectly comfortable doing it while others are not. If your GP is offering it, then they have done it enough and are comfortable with the procedure."
AskDocs,"Sounds like balanitis. Get it evaluated, but likely you will need a longer course of topical medication to get rid of it."
AskDocs,"In general, if you can't bear weight and walk on it, then you should probably get it formally evaluated and possibly get some imaging to rule out a fracture."
Residency,Yeah... No.
Residency,"I die inside every time a medical student asks me to explain renal tubular acidosis. Like, can you not?"
AskDocs,"You can ask his doctors for the MELD score, which is calculated off of his labs and correlates with mortality."
AskDocs,Agree that this is a simple stye.
AskDocs,The reference ranges are right there... They're all normal.
AskDocs,"He's in his 80s and just had a cardiac event; it's going to be hard to bounce back from that, and he may never go back to the way he was prior to this hospitalization. Another thing to consider is that his current blood pressure may be too low, and his doctors should consider a less aggressive target."
AskDocs,"Sounds like TMJ syndrome, which is quite common. It usually comes from clenching or grinding teeth in your sleep or even while awake. Try some over the counter antiinflammatories for a few days and look into a night guard for use when sleeping."
Residency,"Not explicitly stated, but the practice is pretty flexible, and I'm sure I could have that if I wanted to."

AskDocs,You need to go to the hospital. Period. Locking.
AskDocs,Sounds like kidney stones. Let the ER doctors do their work. They're going to be able to give you a better answer than anyone on the internet.
AskDocs,Your body has to digest and move food food through your body at some point. A lot of people have their most active digestion at night. There's nothing you can do about it. It's normal.
AskDocs,Probably a gastrointestinal virus given the prodrome and sudden and rapid onset and offset of symptoms.
AskDocs,Sounds like acid reflux. Most common cause of bad breath other than poor dental hygiene. It can also cause a bitter or acidic taste.
AskDocs,More likely than not it's whatever viral illness you have causing these symptoms. This is not serotonin syndrome.
AskDocs,"Yes, poor sleep can cause headaches."
AskDocs,It's fine. You're fine.
AskDocs,There's no way of telling without seeing it and/or taking a biopsy. Your ENT appointment should be revealing.
twinpeaks,Oh hey Daddy...
AskDocs,"Cancer is highly unlikely due to the quick onset, but you should be evaluated to rule out something like testicular torsion or an incarcerated hernia."
AskDocs,"This sounds like orthostatic hypotension, which means that your blood pressure is dropping when you go from a laying down or sitting position to standing. The most common cause is dehydration. Be sure that you're eating and drinking enough through the day."
AskDocs,"These appear to be simple pimples. Do you shave? If so, be sure to use a clean razor each time and appropriate lubrication."
AskDocs,"This is most certainly related to the back muscles and lower back strain. I see this a lot in people that have physically demanding jobs. Be sure to use appropriate lifting techniques. I would recommend physical therapy over a chiropractor. In the meantime, you can look up back exercises and stretches on the internet to help relieve tension and strengthen your back."
AskDocs,"Regarding your past stomach discomfort, patients will often get rebound reflux that occurs after stopping a PPI. This usually lasts several days to a few weeks and will eventually go away for most people.

Regarding this most recent episode, it sounds like you have a clear trigger. Continue taking the ranitidine. If you're not taking it already, the max dose is 150 mg twice daily."
AskDocs,You need to report this provider to the state medical licensing board. This behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. Please be as detailed as possible. This creep needs to lose his license.
Residency,"There weren't really any contract issues. I signed with a large health organization, so the physician contract was pretty standard. I did negotiate the salary and signing bonus, but, other than that, there were no other points of contention. The restrictive covenant in particular was pretty generous... Only ten miles!"
Residency,"My program is flexible enough that after intern year, I was able to schedule a ton of clinic time. PGY-2 and PGY-3 are split pretty evenly 50/50 between outpatient and inpatient time. I was also fortunate enough to be placed in the smaller resident clinic at one of our affiliates that actually allows me a lot of independence when it comes to outpatient medicine. Starting the latter half of my intern year, I didn't even have to staff patients with the attending unless I had questions. I usually have 5-6 patients scheduled per session (more if I choose to overbook myself). For me, it allows for a lot of self-directed learning, which is how I learn best. I still go over patients with the attending at the end of the session, though, so there's still some fine-tuning here and there, but, for the most part, I'm making all the major shots on my own. 

&#x200B;

I will say that going into primary care from a non-primary care track internal medicine program can be a little intimidating. If you're interested, I would be sure to push for more clinic time and to also be motivated to learn stuff on your own."
Residency,"Mildly insulting, but I guess it depends on the individual. Primary care can be plenty intellectually stimulating. As ""primary care"" implies, you're often the first person to see an undifferentiated patient. I'm currently working up a new patient I saw a week ago for secondary hypogonadism, which I find to be plenty stimulating. I'm actively working up another patient that I'm seeing next week for a possible laryngeal mass. Last month I saw a patient coming in as a new patient with an ""abnormal chest x-ray"" that turned out to be a rare congenital pulmonary malformation. I referred him to pulm and CT surgery, and he recently had it removed and is doing quite well.

&#x200B;

Aside from that, I also thoroughly enjoy just routine follow-up appointments with my primary patients. I love seeing my well-controlled patients and just shooting the shit with them during their visit.

&#x200B;

I would also argue that no field is ""intellectually stimulating"" on a daily basis. Virtually all specialties will have their bread and butter cases that you see >75% of the time, and it's only once in a while that you get patients coming in with a case that you would consider ""intellectually stimulating."""
Residency,"No inpatient time. 

Most internal medicine practices are either inpatient or outpatient, and there are very few that still have people split their time between the hospital and office. I did interview at one place that still had an option to do so, but the internist that does both is a dying breed. It used to be that internists always did both, but the culture has shifted now and many were forced to choose one or the other.

In talking with some of the providers that still do it, they're finding that it's just not practical anymore. Splitting your practice between two very different areas of medicine makes keeping up with practice in each area that much harder and also makes scheduling patients for routine follow-up a nightmare."
AskDocs,Hemerroids.
Residency,Rural/suburban
Residency,"It started out more as an act of curiosity. I found a job listing I really liked in the area I wanted to be and just reached out for more information. Something along the lines of ""I know it's early, but I'm interested."" They got back to me and were like actually we've signed people a year in advance before, so why don't you talk with our medical director on the phone sometime? One thing led to another and all of a sudden I had an interview date. Since it was happening, I decided to go all in and apply to a bunch of other places who were also glad to sign a year in advance. 

I did not need a letter of reference. I just listed my PD and some other attendings as my professional references on my CV and the places reached out on their own. 

You really don't need many extracurriculars or anything to have a competitive application, in my opinion. Your main strengths are how well you can represent yourself and how well your references can speak to you as a professional."
Residency,"I marked the wrong patient as decreased in Epic and had to call down to IT to get it changed. I was trying to be discreet about it, but my senior resident at the time overheard and laughed so hard she started crying."
Residency,I believe it's 29-34 days base PTO depending on seniority plus some additional days depending on your work hours and a number of years of service multiplier.
Residency,"1. No, it's not. Most people start during their last year. I think I've set the record for the earliest to sign a contract in my program. We have a current third year who signed a little later than me last year. If you know exactly where you want to be, I don't think it hurts to start since you can maximize residency stipend earnings and also have a lot of piece of mind. A lot of places will sign you a year in advance. That being said, if you do start early, you're obligated to go all in since most places will want an answer within a few weeks. 

2. There's no centralized uploading service, and I did not have any letters. I had a CV with references including my program director and some attendings who were contacted after the interviews. I just gave them all a heads up that people would be reaching out to ask about me. 

3. Yes. Offices are pretty flexible, and I was able to schedule all of my interviews within a span of 3 weeks."
AskDocs,Tests often require an associated diagnosis code. This is probably the standard code for the EKG machine that they used. It's a dummy placeholder and does not have any significance.
Residency,ðŸ˜¬
Residency,"Appointments are 20 or 40 minutes long (depends on new patients versus follow-ups), and considering a standard 8-5pm workday, that comes out to roughly 24-25 max patients a day."
Residency,"I applied to four places. I have no idea what the typical number is. 

Didn't really spot any red flags in job descriptions, to be honest. Not necessarily ""red flags,"" but you could generally tell a lot about an office by how providers, nurses, and ancillary staff interact with each other."
Residency,"Not formally, no. In more casual conversations with providers, there was an impression that there is room for a lot of growth, and there is the ability to make more or less depending on what my goals are. More than a few people at my practice are part time, whereas another guy I spoke to was saying that it's not hard to start hitting the $250K+ range in a few years depending on how efficient I am."
Residency,"I was specifically looking for full time, and I think a lot of places are looking for full time providers at least to start. The one place I interviewed did have a 4 day work week but it was three sessions for each of those days which ended up being 1.0 FTE. My work schedule will be M-F 8-5am with a rotating 8-12 shift on Saturdays. This is exactly what I was looking for."
Residency,"All the practices I interviewed at were parts of larger healthcare organizations, so I didn't really have any of that small private practice exposure. I'll be one of 11 providers at my practice and feel like that's a good number for me.  Although it's part of a large organization, the office itself is pretty tight knit which was palpable during the interview day. In general, I think having a smaller and more collegial environment is better, but that's a matter of opinion."
Residency,"Answered in a previous post but essentially:

1) Don't want to deal with children.
2) Thought I wanted to specialize at the time and didn't want to close any doors. I specifically wanted to do ID and eventually HIV primary care but ultimately felt that fellowship did not align with my personal and career goals."
Residency,"I'm unsure what bias is like for academic versus community programs, to be honest. I think it matters less for primary care than for other specialties. For what it's worth, I come from a very fellowship driven and inpatient heavy program and did talk about that during interviews. People wondered why I wanted all outpatient medicine despite coming from a program like mine. I talked about still being excited by primary care and looking forward to clinic constantly which I think people responded positively to. That sentiment along with really strong professional references are what ultimately led to my success, in my opinion."
Residency,"I have always loved primary care and actually almost went into family medicine. I chose internal because I did not want to take care of kids, and I also was considering fellowship at the time and didn't want to close any doors. I considered being a hospitalist for a hot second but was immediately turned off by the lack of patient continuity, the schedule, and also the extremely high burnout."
Residency,"No, I did not consider either of these. From my search, most of the positions being offered these days are as an employee of a larger health organization. In fact, one of the places I interviewed was a former private practice group that was bought out by a health system. It's becoming more and more difficult to run a private group these days considering insurance regulations and rising overhead costs. I'm sure that if you do manage to find private practice jobs, it's a bit of a different world that I can't really speak to."
Residency,"It's not tax free to my knowledge. They essentially cut you a check. Usually they pay you in increments every year either when you start or at the end of every year since you started. The way it works for me now is 20K at the end of each year after I start for three years totalling up to a gross payout of 60K. 

My current contract is for three years and will automatically renew unless I terminate before then. 

I'm not sure if I get a renewal bonus, but I doubt it. This isn't a private practice, so there aren't really ""partners.""

My base salary is guaranteed for two years at which point I move over to the standard compensation plan based on billing and RVUs and such. I can switch over earlier, however, as soon as it becomes more profitable for me to do so. Most people start outpacing their guaranteed base salary in less than two years from what I'm told and switch over to the standard compensation plan."
Residency,"Yes, signing bonuses were universal to all the places I received offers. Ranges were $20-30k at time of signing. In addition, there were also resident stipends (addressed above) as well as retention bonuses and loan repayment assistance. The latter two were usually in installments of $20K granted annually up to a certain amount ($60-80K) in addition to your salary."
Residency,Most everything was through Practice Link.
Residency,"Residency stipend offers ranged from $500-1000 per month starting at the time of signing to one month before the starting date. The contract I signed is the $1000 per month offer. I signed earlier this month and am starting in August, so that's an extra $16K on top of my signing bonus. I would definitely say it's worth financially if you know what you want this early. It's a nice lump sum to start out with to do things like make a downpayment on a house or buy a new car... Or both."
Residency,"Yes, absolutely, and I would argue that it's vital to ask these types of questions. Appointment length and the number of patients per day was a big factor in job selection, and it should be one of the major factors for anyone choosing to go into outpatient medicine. I have seen far too many people get burnt out by primary care after having joined practices with a high salary but coming with a cost of having to see upwards of 30 patients per day with 10-minute appointments."
Residency,"Thanks. It's definitely exciting to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. The people I'm going to be working with seem to really love their jobs, and they stressed that work-life balance is really valued at this practice."
Residency,"Semi-important. All but one place I interviewed at had Epic, and all the Epic practices had both inpatient and outpatient Epic. While I am familiar with most types of EMRs from medical school rotations and affiliate sites, I am most comfortable with Epic. The one place without Epic was still pretty impressive, but it was certainly a downside in my mind having used the one that they had before, especially also considering that their inpatient units had a different system entirely."
Residency,"I also forgot to mention BENEFITS discussions. You'll likely spend a good 30-60 minutes with someone talking about health insurance, disability insurance, and other employee benefits. It's boring, but you should pay close attention. If you are even thinking about anything like having a child or other special situations, I would make sure to address maternity/paternity leave and those other situations."
Residency,"I did negotiate. It's pretty common, and I think most people expect it. I was offered more money by another practice but ultimately decided to go with the one I felt was a better fit. I was very upfront about what the other practice was offering me and asked if there was any wiggle room with the current offer. While they told me that they could not match the other offer, I ended up getting a little more on both my base salary and signing bonus. If you're going to negotiate, I would recommend being frank about it if other people are offering you more. I wouldn't ask them to match the offer but just more phrase it as not wanting to ""leave anything on the table"" and inquiring if this is truly the best they can offer."
Residency,"Interviews were all pretty varied, to be honest. I had ones where I was literally ""wined and fined"" the night before and others that were very to the point without many frills.

&#x200B;

In general, I think the job interviews I had were more casual than either residency or medical school interviews. Questions were more geared towards finding out about me as a person and if I would mesh well with the other providers at the practice. I also interviewed at two places where I would be taking over for another provider and would be inheriting their patient panel -- these individuals were often even more invested in my personality and if I was a ""good person."" For the most part, however, I feel like I spent the majority of my time talking about myself outside the context of medicine. I would be prepared to be able to talk about your hobbies and personal life a great deal more than you would expect in a residency interview. That being said, there were certainly more formal questions as well that I think more often than not came from a standardized form that interviewers had to fill out for their organization. Some examples include ""tell me about a difficult clinical situation you have been involved in and how you overcame it"" and ""what would the nursing staff say about you.""

&#x200B;

I received all of my offers within a few days after the interview day. Only one place gave me an explicit deadline for answering -- two weeks, although even then they said I could take more time if I needed to decide.

&#x200B;

Typical interview day(s) for me were as follows:

Night before:

\-Put up in a nice hotel

\-plus/minus nice dinner with providers

Day of:

\-Breakfast

\-Interview with providers

\-Interview with the practice manager

\-Lunch

\-Interview with other people -- this varied from place to place, but at some places, I interviewed with higher-up administrative type people like the regional director, CMO, etc.

\-Shadowing with providers (HIGH YIELD)

\-Tour

\-plus/minus dinner with providers

&#x200B;

Expect your day to be pretty packed. Most of my days went from 7/8AM to 3PM.

&#x200B;

As far as tips: In general, try to be yourself as much as possible. Bring a padfolio to write things down. Be nice to EVERYONE from the janitorial staff to the president of the hospital. Wear a tailored suit -- avoid black. If they don't offer it, I would highly recommend asking to come back to shadow with providers. I think being able to see the process and flow of the practice was the thing that sold me the most."
AskDocs,"Dude, it's a pimple."
lactoseintolerant,I carry Lactaid chewables with me everywhere. You never know when a cheese opportunity will present itself.
AskDocs,"An OTC steroid cream with help with the immediate lesions. Apply twice daily for no more than a week. To prevent them from reoccurring, keep your skin moisturized with a hypoallergenic moisturizer."
AskDocs,Nah.
AskDocs,Eczema.
AskDocs,"Sounds like a gastric ulcer. Would continues with the calcium as needed but you should also try an antacid like Omeprazole or lansoprazole. Avoid ibuprofen as it can make things worse. Finally, I would see a GP straight away. Aside from the obvious pain you're having, you need to have your depression and binge drinking addressed for your long term health."
AskDocs,Sounds like the flu or other viral illness. You mostly just have to wait it out. Ibuprofen should help with body aches a little.
Residency,"Nah, man, MAGIC CUP is where it's at."
AskDocs,"If your symptoms are this severe and not getting better with psychotherapy, you need to see a physician to start medications. SSRIs are first line for your kind of problem. In the interim, I would avoid any further sexual encounters since it seems to be causing you significant distress. "
AskDocs,You're fine.
AskDocs,There are two general options once conservative over the counter options have been explored: medications and Botox injections. The latter is usually done by a dermatologist. Would make an appointment with your primary to discuss it.
Residency,"I mean, it's not unreasonable for undifferentiated sepsis..."
AskDocs,No relation.
AskDocs,"Bad idea. Even if someone is already medically optimized, there is benefit to going for evaluation and observation. There are many complications of strokes such as brain bleeding that require monitoring."
AskDocs,Colon cancer takes YEARS to develop. There's a reason we don't repeat them more often than every 3 years. 
AskDocs,This is a normal EKG aside from mild tachycardia. 
AskDocs,"Just keep doing what you're doing. Stay hydrated, eat as tolerated, and rest. Your body will do the rest. Taking over the counter medications can help with symptoms. It sounds like some Sudafed may benefit you. Would not take it for more than 3 days in a row."
AskDocs,"Yes, it's relatively safe for one time. "
AskDocs,All of these glucose readings are in the non-diabetic range. You are not diabetic. It is not uncommon for people to have glucose readings a little above 100 and for it to be completely normal. Your A1C is also very reassuring and shows that your glucose levels are not elevated chronically. 
AskDocs,Yes to both.
AskDocs,Unlikely.
AskDocs,Probably a skin tag if it was able to be removed that easily.
AskDocs,"I mean, you definitely can't just pluck off a melanoma..."
AskDocs,You're right. The major guidelines recommend against aspirin as primary prevention now. I do not think there is any benefit in a young healthy adult. 
AskDocs,"Highly advise against this. There is some exciting research going on with metformin, yes, but there is nothing concrete that is accepted by the medical community yet in terms of aging and longevity effects.

Taking metformin without the guidance of a physician can be dangerous. The risk of lactic acidosis is low in a young healthy individual, but long-term use can lead to pretty significant B12 deficiency which can cause all sorts of problems."
AskDocs,"Dizziness is not typically a symptom of acute HIV infection. It's usually a cold-like illness or more cases than not, it's completely asymptomatic. "
AskDocs,"It is highly unlikely that a 23 year old that is otherwise healthy would have cardiac pain unless there is a family history of a genetic disorder in the family causing extremely high cholesterol. The vast majority of chest pain in young people can be attributes to chest wall muscles, heart burn, or the ever so popular precordial catch syndrome. "
medicalschool,"LFTs are honestly useless without the bilirubin and total protein values. If you get asked what the globulin gap is on a patient, you're SOL with this diagram. The rotated BMP model for LFTs is much more useful in clinical practice. "
medicalschool,This is the divalent diagram I use. The coag panel is a flipped version of that with INR at the top and PT/PTT at the bottom.
AskDocs,It could be nothing or it could be something. Getting an ultrasound is a cheap and easy way to have it evaluated.
AskDocs,"These pictures are useless, but, in any case, your doctor is right. A lot of people have incidental nodules or tumors on CT scans. In the lungs, something that is 3 mm is typically benign and does not require further workup. Depending on how the radiologist reads it, more ""suspicious"" lesions may warrant follow-up imaging in 6-12 months. "
AskDocs,Are you kidding me? The risk is zero in this case.
DoctorStrange,I found a copy by chance a couple of years ago at a comic book outlet for 5 bucks. Great condition and a really lucky find. I think most people selling it these days wants at least 50.

TheSimpsons,I'm Bart Simpson.
AskDocs,"If you're not having any other respiratory symptoms, the chances are slim."
AskDocs,Lol no. This is not Frank's sign.
AskDocs,Sure.
AskDocs,"It's part of the healing process. Signs to look out for are any puss like drainage, increased pain, and increased swelling. Some redness and swelling is to he expected, but rapidly developing symptoms are more concerning, especially with pain. Neosporin or just plain Vaseline will work. A good number of people are allergic to Neosporin which can make the redness worse."
AskDocs,"Pancreatic cancer in your age group is extremely rare. Not only that, but you don't  have any other symptoms to suggest a malignant process. Muscle pain from a viral illness can last for weeks after an infection. The fact that it is reproducible with movement is reassuring. "
AskDocs,Nope. Healing normally. Just keep it covered and clean.
medicine,This is why I went into adult medicine. 
AskDocs,It means that your semen sample was likely contaminated by the bacteria on your skin when it was collected. This does not mean that your actual semen has an infection. 
AskDocs,"Yeah, that's reasonable."
AskDocs,"Ventricular hypertrophy can be diagnosed on an EKG by the presence of high amplitude waves in certain leads. That being said, it is not at all uncommon for young, healthy individuals to have high amplitude waves, especially if they are thin or athletic. It is extremely unlikely that chest discomfort in a young, otherwise healthy individual to be related to a cardiac source. "
AskDocs,"The size of the stone does not necessarily correlate with the pain, but, in general, stones under 6 mm will pass on their own and do not require further intervention. "
AskDocs,"Sounds like epididymitis. If it's not too bad, you may be able to wait until Thursday. If it gets any worse or you begin developing other symptoms such as fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, or dizziness, I would get seen in the ER or at an urgent care. "
AskDocs,"Without a visible lesion, testing is low yield. Blood tests are generally useless as most people that are sexually active are exposed but only a minority will develop symptoms. Regardless, if you've been exposed, the blood test will come back positive and is not predictive of symptoms. Most diagnoses of herpes are made based on physical exam and not testing. They are very classic in appearance."
AskDocs,"Sounds like you've got a mild viral infection. They can commonly cause these nonspecific symptoms. There's nothing really to do than to wait for your body to fight it off. If it's getting worse or persisting longer than several weeks, I would go get reevaluated."
AskDocs,I would go to your primary care or an urgent care to see if you can get an anti-nausea medication to help you through this. Paxil tends to have pretty bad withdrawal symptoms and can make you feel worse. 
AskDocs,"Nasal spray can help. I would recommend either just regular saline or something like Flonase. You can also get Sudafed for some congestion relief, although I wouldn't take it for more than three days since people can develop rebound symptoms when taking Sudafed for too long."
AskDocs,We need a picture to be able to evaluate any skin issues.
AskDocs,"These things can take WEEKS to resolve completely. Try out the medications for a few days. It's not likely to completely go away, but it should start getting better soon. If it's getting worse, then I would be seen again to he evaluated for pneumonia, but right now it sounds like a viral infection that would not benefit from antibiotics. "

lancaster,"The one in Columbia (Phap HOA Temple) is the main one in the area. I don't know of any others. It's primarily Vietnamese folk that go there, but they welcome anyone. My family used to go on major holidays, and I had Vietnamese classes there growing up, but i haven't been in a few years. "
medicine,"This. I routinely get called for admissions for ""ACS rule out"" that are clearly GERD or musculoskeletal chest pain. I internally roll my eyes every time I hear an ED provider mention the HEART score. "
marvelstudios,There can only be one.
AskDocs,"Yes. If you have sensitive skin, it's better to use an unscented or hypoallergenic moisturizer, but, in general, it's okay."
AskDocs,"Agree with your doctor that it sounds like postural hypotension. Make sure to stay hydrated. In the meantime, you can prevent it by not getting up too quickly. Sit for a minute or so before getting up."
AskDocs,"If you had rabies a week ago and weren't properly treated, you wouldn't be alive to post this today. End of story."
AskDocs,It should help a lot. We avoid stronger steroids on the face since the skin is thinner.
AskDocs,They can.
AskDocs,Hemorrhoid.
AskDocs,"There are medications that can help and barring that, Botox injections are sometimes used. Ask for a referral to a dermatologist."
AskDocs,Looks like folliculitis and not an STD.
AskDocs,Looks allergic to me. Would try a mild over the counter hydrocortisone cream.
AskDocs,"Yes, it's possible. The cyst will never truly go away unless you physically go in and tear out the sack that is accumulating the fluid. In the meantime, it will fill and sometimes drain spontaneously."
AskDocs,Just leave it alone. Trying to dislodge and clots or residue can cause more bleeding and irritation. Try purchasing a humidifier to use at night. They're relatively cheap and can prevent your nasal passage from becoming overly dry and prone to bleeding.
medicine,"I'm a PGY-2 internal medicine resident going into primary care. Over the holidays, I was looking at jobs for fun and happened upon a listing that seemed very attractive in the location that I want to be. One thing led to another, and I now not only have an in-person interview with this practice coming up but also with two other practices that I applied to after this first experience went so well.   


A little background on my situation: I'm coming from a large quaternary care academic center where the vast majority of graduates go on to do fellowship. I'm married, and my partner and I are thinking about adoption in the next few years. In addition to loving the area we're from, we're looking to move back to our home town in PA close to our families for the extra support. It's an up and coming rural/suburban-ish area. This is where we want to be, and there's relatively little flexibility in being too much further away.  


I'm now realizing that my interviews are coming up very fast, and I'd like some advice on things to look out for on the job hunt. I've already spoken to some attendings and have addressed things like base salary/RVUs, tail coverage, and restrictive covenants, but I was wondering if there's anything else my fellow Redditors would recommend asking about. Any red flags to look out for? Any benefits (e.g., signing bonus, resident stipend, relocation assistance, loan assistance) that are routinely offered that I should fight for if they're not offered? I'm also planning on getting a lawyer or company to look at my contract when it comes around to that. Any recommendations on those?  


Any recs or advice are much appreciated! I can provide more info upon request. "
Residency,Vom
Residency,"I always try to do it if possible. When I bring it up on rounds, it's always like a surprise to the attending who's like ""oh yeah I guess we could do that too"" and then the patient doesn't have to wait like a week for a floor bed to open up. "
Residency,But also just discharge the patient from the ICU jesus
AskDocs,"This may be related to your medication, but you need to be evaluated by a physician to rule out more dangerous causes such as infection and malignancy. "
AskDocs,"No, you don't have throat cancer. "
AskDocs,Metformin can also be used in PCOS. It is an FDA approved drug for that purpose in addition to its use in diabetes.
AskDocs,Agreed that this could be something as simple as allergies. 
AskDocs,"If you made it through that episode without having fulminant liver failure, then you should be fine. The liver has pretty great regenerative capabilities."
AskDocs,Skipped and extra beats occasionally is normal.
AskDocs,Highly unlikely.
AskDocs,So like... Did they test you for STDs? Seems like a big oversight if they didn't.
