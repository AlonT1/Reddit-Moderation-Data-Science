medicine,"Everyone dies sooner or later. I mean the patients who we can predict are doomed to the nightmare of being entangled in lines and tubes in an ICU bed, or maybe stepped down to a floor bed. Maybe they'll make it to a SNF, but probably there will be a bounceback. These are the patients who everyone can see that there is no happy ending. There could have been a quickly and relatively comfortable death; instead, we can work hard to ensure a slow and torturous death."
AskDocs,"The standard recommendation is not to restart above 25 mg per day if you have been off it for more than three days. That's one of the biggest headaches of an otherwise safe, tolerable, and effective medication.

The risk of restarting at the full dose is low in absolute terms, but it's much lower with slower dose increases. The risk of non-SJS rashes is also lower, and even benign rashes might waste your time and money in the ER making sure they aren't SJS.

I don't want to backseat drive for your neurologist, but I would double check that this was communicated clearly and you are in agreement with each other."
AskDocs,"My hospital is having a small meltdown over getting too few vaccines to cover all physicians, let alone all the nurses and other frontline staff.  Everyone is trying to argue that they are the most critical and need first access, and it has gotten ugly.

We have all seen people, including colleagues, die of COVID. This vaccine would have to be implausibly horrible to not be worth it."
AskDocs,"This is a hot issue right now. There is more than enough misinformation flying around.

Comments from users who appear on this subreddit only to discuss a specific political topic, medical condition, health care role, or similar single-topic issues will be removed. Comments which deviate from the topic of a thread to interject an unrelated personal opinion (e.g. politics) or steer the conversation to their pet issue will be removed.

* Obiturary and memorial posts for healthcare workers are being collected at /r/medicinememorial

**For the above reasons or due to moderator discretion for any post related to COVID-19, please post otherwise rule-abiding material as a comment in the megathread rather than a stand-alone post.**

medicine,Please post in the COVID megathread or existing numerous vaccine threads.
medicine,"I just recently saw a similar woman, trached at baseline and recently vent dependent admitted for acute on subacute on chronic respiratory failure. She tried to disconnect herself from the vent and apparently mouthed that she didn’t want to live. She was also quite delirious, although it’s harder to recognize in a patient whose communication is so impaired.

After her pneumonia and UTI were treated she was still delirious but didn’t want to die and didn’t remember wanting to die. Family said it was against her clearly stated wishes and longstanding beliefs as a practicing Catholic. But what if they said she had never wanted to live on a vent? Or they had no idea or weren’t reachable?

Just to say that DNR is tricky, and assistance with dying more so. Better deaths than drawn-out torture in an ICU should be achievable, but by the time patients make it to us it’s often the wrong time to try to figure out wishes. Permitting death due to delirium would be an unforgivable dereliction of medical duty."
medicine,“So you’re saying she’s a veteran with decades of experience. Really tough.”
medicine,"This is also a strange example because it appears to have involved multiple confirmations that the patient would want everything done, which may have been or may have been perceived as efforts to make her DNR/DNI—but then wishes were honored, everything was done, *and she died.* The doctors were arguably right not that she had no quality of life but that intervention reached futility and only prolonged suffering. We can’t know.

>It's common that doctors often see someone with multiple disabilities, like McSweeney, one way and the person's friends, family and caregivers see her another.

Sure, the “disability paradox,” but this overlooks the far more common disagreement in medicine: families see a “fighter” and a chance for recovery. Doctors see prolonged suffering before an unavoidable decline and death. That is an area where the medical staff are more clear-eyes.

Which of these was more at play here is unknowable, but I think the article does a disservice in calling this out entirely as dereliction of duty to a patient who was, by all indications, given treatment."

Self-citation is mildly academically scummy at times, but not a critical issue.

They buried the lede in this guy being part of the misinformation engine around COVID. *That* is a black mark on Elsevier and this writer."
AskDocs,"We’ve had that. Unsurprisingly it was entirely ignored. There are already many posts removed for not providing sufficient information, and we’re also trying to strike the balance with how many posts require moderator attention and intervention."
AskDocs,"The test isn’t risky. If it’s positive, then maybe a colonoscopy, which is higher risk. Maybe something is seen and removed, either endoscopically or with open surgery. With each step, the risk is low but not zero.

The problem is that true colorectal cancer in young ages is rare enough that most of those interventions end up being invasive for nothing. The risk is small but bigger than the even smaller chance of catching and treating something serious."
AskDocs,"That question is different in males and females, but the answer seems to be no, with limited and mixed evidence, for both."
AskDocs,"I don’t know the answer to that. I suspect lower chance, but I’m no expert on the essay."
medicine,"It’s all part and parcel of the furious focus on dicks and how they work. NoFap, PSSD, damage from porn, and even a burgeoning idea that multiple sexual partners is damaging for men. Men worry about having not enough erections, too many erections, erections that don’t last or erections that last too long.

All of this is based on scant to no evidence, but anecdotes bounce around in the online echo chambers and take on the ring of truth."
AskDocs,"There really isn’t loss of nocturnal penile tumescence with otherwise fully functional arousal and orgasm, as far as I know. If there’s no problem while awake then there’s no problem."
AskDocs,"It’s a rare false positive, especially with tests mostly used now. I wouldn’t worry about it. If you do test positive you can bring it up, but there’s no reason to preempt it."
AskDocs,"Drinking that much for that long can lead to withdrawal—which you know, because that’s the shakiness. It’s rare for it to be dangerous, but it’s still something worth discussing with a doctor as you cut down and stop.

It’s also worth talking because there are therapies and medications that can help you stop drinking if you need help."
AskDocs,"The risk of colorectal cancer at a young age with no consistent symptoms is tiny. It’s not zero, but very small. The difficulty of many cancers is that there isn’t any good screening that catches cancers but doesn’t raise the risk of surgical interventions when there’s actually no cancer.

For colon cancer, MRI is not the screening of choice. You would want a colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or fecal occult blood test (looking for blood in stool). Those are standard starting at age 50, but not before, because the risk of the testing is higher than any benefit.

I said that about screening, but an MRI of your abdomen would pick up any abdominal tumor. It’s a slow and expensive test, and the greater risk is “incidentaloma” meaning a mass found, for which you get surgery, that turns out to be benign. Abdominal interventions aren’t without risk!

Fortunately in your case nothing turned up. There are many reasons for abdominal pain that aren’t cancers, most of them not risky but annoying."
AskDocs,"If you aren’t having other sexual problems, this is just a quirk, probably of timing and sleep cycle more than anything else. “Nocturnal penile tumescence” is probably happening, just not at the end of sleep when you wake up. It’s not a problem if it’s not causing any problems."
medicine,"The data on risks of sexual problems post-SSRI versus in general have never looked convincing to me. Yes, it can happen and be lasting after SSRIs, but also without ever having taken SSRIS.

This is one of the internet darling diagnosis and embraced by anti-psychiatry well ahead of solid evidence."
AskDocs,"That is a painful format to read.

Nothing leaps out as scary. Keep it mind that the normal ranges are set very conservatively. Most readings slightly outside that range are also normal. The reason is to make sure every real abnormality is flagged; the downside is lots of normality also gets flagged, which is why doctors should read labs.

I understand why patients are given access, but the amount of anxiety produced by the lack of training to interpret the pile of numbers causes harm, I think."
AskDocs,"It would show up.

A change in QT interval doesn’t change your heart rate and cannot be felt. It’s a measure of an electrical signal, not the action of heart muscle.

SSRIs are known to slightly decrease heart rate. It’s rarely meaningful. They also decrease anxiety, which can substantially decrease heart rate and blood pressure."
AskDocs,"I’m going to be that guy and nitpick. QT is inherently related to heart rate, which is why it has to be corrected and different formulas adjust for high or low HR in various ways.

But the idea is right: heart rate affects (raw) QT interval, but QT interval has no effect on heart rate."

medicine,"Yes, the NNT for vaccines is fairly high, but it doesn't account for the protection of herd immunity. This is also NNT for a very abbreviated time window. Most people are less worried about getting infected just in the next 2.5-3 months than over the next year or years. Calculating NNH based on non-serious harm gets silly with vaccines. You want to trigger an immune response, and [NSAIDs for the mild discomfort of vaccination might get in the way](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/1_Supplement/45.18).

There are some reasonable questions here, like efficacy in non-studied populations, effect on infectivity, and long-term effects. Just spitting out this NNT and NNH in a slide is disingenuous and feeds into the panic and misinformation narratives around this."

>From the moment Dr. Patel became aware of Mr. Smith’s HIV status, he refused to come near Mr. Smith. Dr. Patel proceeded to question Mr. Smith in an aggressive, demeaning, and discriminatory manner, displaying a patent bias against Mr. Smith on the basis of his HIV status. Emblematic of Dr. Patel’s reaction to learning of Mr. Smith’s HIV status, when handing Mr. Smith a piece of paper, he did so by keeping his body as far away from Mr. Smith as he could, at arms’ length.

...

>According to Dr. Patel’s chart notes dated May 13, 2020, Mr. Smith was refused treatment because he posed a “risk” to “the staff” due to his HIV status.

medicine,"Now even high-risk treatment is routinely done for HIV-positive patients on HAART. That's how the Berlin Patient and the London Patient came to be.

HIV is like many other chronic conditions, except with the at least potential risk of transmission. It also still carries stigma that hasn't fully faded. No one seems to worry to that degree about hep C despite a six-fold higher risk or hep B despite a 100-fold higher risk for non-immunized exposure."
medicine,"We could have said that about any disease and HIV. Canceling all elective cases would be a rational decision. Canceling some cases based wholly on speculation about risk is dicey. Canceling some cases based on another factor and claiming post hoc that it was about COVID risk is a transparent dodge.

Edit: ""According to Dr. Patel’s chart notes dated May 13, 2020, Mr. Smith was refused treatment because he posed a “risk” to “the staff” due to his HIV status."""
medicine,"Yes, but you can't refuse because of the disability per se. It has to be because the disability presents a barrier to care that is insurmountable. The same reasoning means you can't refuse to hire someone because of a disability unless there's no way to make the job workable around the disability. You do have to hire a qualified deaf driver even if that means accommodation. You don't have to hire a blind driver.

If you think there would be a bad outcome, you aren't obligated to operate and may be obligated not to operate. That requires an actual rationale for a bad outcome. ""The patient has fully controlled HIV and has for a long time"" is not any kind of plausible risk. You can spin hypotheticals for it, but they won't stand up in court."
medicine,"Everything in life has risk. All patient encounters have some risk. All surgeries have more risk.

Does this surgeon routinely test for all potential needlestick infections? But that wouldn't even apply here; the viral load is undetectable, so it relies entirely on the patient's honesty. And it also, as far as we know, can't be transmitted.

This isn't about risk; it is about perceived risk. His perception is against science. Again, what if he perceived treating any category of patients as high risk? I don't think that applies; you get to choose what is done *to* you, and you have some right to choose what you do, but those rights are limited."

AskDocs,"Dead tissue anywhere has something happen to it. In most cases, it's replaced by fibrosis—scar tissue. That can fill space and hold things together, but it can't do the job that part of the body is supposed to do.

Ischemic stroke? You lose brain and get gliosis—brain scar. Heart attack? Heart muscle replaced by non-muscle fibrotic tissue, which can't pump and, if there's enough, results in heart failure. Infarction of a major vessel in a limb? Everything downstream is no longer supplied and will die.

medicine,"This claim is made over and over, and it’s of course hard to argue because, hey, the evidence is deleted.

But multiple times I’ve gone through the logs and no, there are not many deleted threads about this. There are a handful, and they are removed immediately for other rules violations with, I think, a single exception when a post was removed many comments in because the conversation was deemed an unfixable assortment of rules violations.

There are people will will argue that the doctors are wrong and that they know better. Dunning-Kruger effect is everywhere.

I don’t know if medicine is particularly prone to that or if I just pick it up in medicine more. In some ways that makes sense: everyone has a body and health. We all feel like experts just by experience and can confirm anything, right or wrong, with Google. Others spread deliberate misinformation, trolling or out of passionate beliefs that something is more important than medical accuracy.

This is why we insist on flairs. It’s not a guarantee of anything, but it’s a first-pass filter against nonsense."
AskDocs,"This is obviously difficult because you can’t ask babies questions, much less fetuses. There is a point before which the neural circuitry necessary to experience pain as we understand it doesn’t exist, and most sources put that around 24 weeks, I think. It’s tied to hot-button abortion politics, so the science has been politicized and people argue in bad faith.

It’s more complicated because the reflex arcs necessary to, for example, move a limb away from a sharp poke doesn’t require a brain at all.

What they feel depends on neural development, probably builds over time whether in utero or after delivery, and yes, is hard to imagine.

There are also people who never can feel pain—congenital insensitivity to pain. That itself is a rare, fascinating abnormality."

Psychiatry,"This violates rule 7 and this is a spillover of the animus that has pretty much entirely absorbed r/residency and becomes a tempest in a teacup in r/medicine on a regular basis.

Still, it has responses, and it matters, so I'll leave it up. As a general thought, every  r/residency post on NPs does not need to make waves in r/psychiatry as well."
Psychiatry,"Maybe. Some programs emphasize therapy much more heavily in the second half. I could again do some fuzzy math and say 4000 hours. That seems like too much. 3000? 2000?

A PsyD has a minimum of 1500 hours, I think more often around 2000 in practicums. I think, in the end, it's within spitting distance of the amount that some—not all, but some—psychiatry programs provide.

Psychiatrists graduate with so many hours that even a fraction of the training being dedicated to therapy adds up to a whole lot of therapy. Psychiatrists have a ""shit ton of training"" in psychiatry, period."

Psychiatry,"This is not a forum for patients to discuss their own experiences, positive or negative."
Psychiatry,"Very few, because medical school covers all specialties and so only a few weeks are dedicated to psychiatry, but that's the wrong question.

After medical school a psychiatry resident cannot just go and practice psychiatry independently. A resident is a psychiatrist, but there's an asterisk and supervision required. It's effectively an apprenticeship. After a year, or some 2000-2500 hours of patient care, a resident can become licensed as a physician—but is not eligible to sit for boards and become a psychiatrist. Few doctors stop training at that point. Most go on to complete three more years of residency. A fair number do an additional year of fellowship subspecialty training in areas like child and adolescent psychiatry (actually two years, but one usually replaces the fourth of residency) or geriatric psychiatry or consultation-liaison psychiatry or others.

Not knowing anything about medicine and medical training is part of how obfuscating the issue can look like a win for NPs. I don't think it's an authentic view, and what it does is stir up all kinds of acrimony."
Psychiatry,"Removed under rule #1. This is not a place to ask questions if you are not involved in the practice of psychiatry. If you are a medical/psychiatric professional, please read rule 6 on how to verify credentials.

For medical questions, you can try r/AskDocs or r/AskPsychiatry."
Psychiatry,"Residency is four years. Many nights and weekends. The legal limit is 80 hour weeks; psychiatry residents almost never actually work that much, at least not consistently, but 60 hour weeks are common.

A conservative back of the envelope estimate of 40 hours of direct patient care per week, for 50 weeks per year, for 4 years, and you get 8,000 hours.

Residents who don’t get a lot of psychotherapy training rarely become psychotherapists, and those who do probably got comparatively little psychotherapy training. Maybe only a sixteenth of their time? 500 hours?"
medicine,"Look, it's not about better immunity, it's about sending a message.

That started as a joke, but I'm worried we may need healthcare workers to get publicly vaccinated to show that it's not some ploy and the people in the best position to know are clamoring for this stuff. Don't want it? I'll take seconds."
medicine,">Maybe this is self defensive. Maybe it's a trauma response. Maybe it'll all come back to me in a flood one day when this is all over and it'll bring me to my knees. Or maybe I'm just fundamentally broken as a person by everything I’ve witnessed this year. Maybe this is permanent.

Speaking professionally—both as someone who works with minds for a living and as a professional who has been present for deaths, some bad, some COVID...

Of course it's self-defense. Maybe it'll all come back, but maybe it won't. There's nothing broken about growing callus where you've been rubbed raw too much, too quickly. We all do. That's where all black humor, stone-faced refusal to acknowledge sorrow, and sometimes burnout come from. They're all quirks of how we get through to the next day and the next day and the next.

If there's a time that it all does come back, I hope you have good people around you to help you figure out what to do with this impossible experience. Friends, family, colleagues, and whatever Meddit can do. Sometimes we're a dysfunctional family, we medical people, but we all are a kind of family.

Thank you for sharing."

This is not a reasonable source. It is not even accurate.

>Students who identify as Black, Indigenous, or as a Person of Color (BIPOC) may have personal concerns about fulfilling the Compact requirements based on historical injustices and current events, and may find [this information](https://health.cornell.edu/resources/especially-for/students-of-color/compliance-testing-flu-vaccine-requirements) helpful in considering an exemption.

What information?

>The aforementioned inequities and injustices may lead some individuals to have reservations about testing and immunization, yet it is also important to acknowledge the critical role these measures play in protecting community health and well-being. In fact, they are likely to be especially helpful for BIPOC communities. For example, annual influenza vaccination is recommended for every individual 6 months or older who does not have medical contraindications, as it is the best way to help protect against flu. The vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and flu-related deaths. Those who get the vaccine not only protect themselves, but also the people around them who may be more vulnerable to serious flu illness, including infants, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions. They are designed to help students stay safe, and they are part of the quality health care students can access while on campus. We strongly recommend that students comply with these requirements. At the same time, we understand that someone may know the science and still feel distrusting of health care and may have addition questions.

Cornell carefully recognizes hesitancy without, in fact, explicitly accepting it. What they ask for (with a typo) is a chance to engage in discussion. Do you know what doesn't do that? Sneering biased sources.

Your ban this time will be one week. Kindly do not bring this to r/medicine again."
AskDocs,"I don't think it's a shouting match. There's room to disagree and learn things.

Hospitals have a patient selection bias. That's where sick people where things have gone wrong end up. You don't see the patients nearly as often who happen to be on chronic ""bad"" meds and everything is fine. It's also sometimes a choice between no good options: falls risk and potential of addiction versus debilitating panic disorder that is refractory to everything else.

Fortunately, that's actually rare. Most of the time there really are better options.

Anyone who insists on HCTZ is wrong, but there's a case for chlorthalidone. There's also a group of patients who will definitely insist on clonidine, but that's a different story."

Patients saying they are suicidal is absolutely not reason to admit them to the hospital. Having that policy, if patients are aware, is good reason for them not to be honest and forthcoming with how they are actually feeling. On the other side, I have had chronically suicidal patients who told me every appointment that they wanted to die, thought about dying, and weren't about to do it, and they left and so far not one has acted on suicidality.

For all other visible issues, particularly dermatological, a photograph is not required, but always helpful."
AskDocs,This is obviously unrelated and you know it. AskDocs is not somewhere to grandstand about pet issues.
medicine,You were warned. Goodbye.
medicine,"This study doesn’t look at autism. It appears to go fishing for problems and find them by multiple inference. It’s also inherently a sample that is both biased (by the nature of the practitioner) and non-random, but at least take it to task for the actual flaws rather than the usual flaws.

Tl;dr: if you can’t blame vaccines for autism, blame them for everything but autism."
medicine,Drop it.
medicine,"COVID really isn’t like Ebola. Ebola still has something like one in four to one in two mortality. That’s more than an order of magnitude higher than COVID.

But it doesn’t have significant asymptomatic presence, it’s not airborne, and outbreaks have stayed local. The disease is very different and the scope of disaster is also very different. COVID *isn’t* Ebola and isn’t like Ebola.

COVID-influenza comparisons are bad and a mainstay of misinformation. COVID-Ebola comparison is also bad; no dimension of comparison is useful, and although the intention seems good, the comparison doesn’t work, and therefore isn’t convincing."
medicine,"Humor, I think, but it falls flat. Please be mindful of rule 5."
medicine,RNAses are so ubiquitous and RNA so unstable that lab work with it is actually very finicky. It’s all too easy to degrade all your mRNA before you get to do whatever you want.
medicine,"I’m sure it’s been done, but you can get the military to pay for medical school and a stipend on top of that by committing to a period of service as a military doctor afterwards.

I didn’t do it, so I can’t comment much more than that."
medicine,"Please rule out shunt malfunction. 

Patient doesn’t have a VP shunt? Have you checked? Get neurosurgery to go exploring for a shunt that you can’t be certain isn’t present!"
medicine,Cannot exclude VisiCalc.
medicine,"Please include a starter comment when posting, especially images."
medicine,"I’m not going to remove this because it has garnered thorough responses, but rule 6 is against participating in r/medicine to push an agenda. Your history is clear that you have such an agenda, and it anti-medical and anti-scientific. This will be your one and only warning.

Edit: I have rethought this. The counterarguments can stand on their own. I *am* removing this."
medicine,"Ebola is far worse than COVID.

Ebola outbreaks have been nowhere near as bad as the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s not the any given case, it’s the area under the curve."
medicine,"Minds run on brains. Brains are machines honed by hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Don’t think of that as millions of years of fine-tuned engineering, though. Think of it as millions of years of committee meetings and “good enough” and kludged solutions. We are running software from the last few hundred thousand years on an operating system that’s millions of years old on legacy hardware that’s barely interoperable. None of the code is commented.

More prosaically, humans are bad at statistics, and humans are also often misinformed. HIV conjures AIDS from the 80s, not HAART from the present day. It’s foreign and scary. Mutilation in a car crash is more likely, but we all live with cars and habituate to chronic but low risk."
medicine,"I think you could make an honest commercial that puts it in perspective.

“I didn’t wear a mask. I’m young and healthy. She didn’t wear a mask; she thought it was overblown.” [Shot of patient in ICU, festooned with lines; ventilator sounds] “Now Grandma is in the hospital. She’s been like this for days. And I just keep thinking—maybe we could have avoided this. Maybe I could have avoided this.”

Scarier and relatively higher risk of near-future harm to loved ones is possible. It’s not as remote or as much of a coin flip. It wouldn’t reach everyone, and some hard-core deniers would decry it as more hoax, but maybe it could reach some people who haven’t seen the reality before it becomes a reality for them."
medicine,"“I’m concerned that there’s something psych going on but I can’t put my finger on it” is a perfectly good consult question. I don’t think not having a totally clear question is reason not to see a patient. My issue is when I am unclear on what, if anything, is wanted as help. When I guess, and guess wrong, I waste everyone’s time and potentially document more problems instead of solutions.

Stroke neurologists get called when there’s at least concern for stroke. Psychiatry can get called for many things, and if I don’t divine the right one, I might document something that is exactly what the primary team *doesn’t* want. With capacity, I can’t medicolegally assess unless I know specifically what to assess."
medicine,Removed under rule 10.
medicine,"I’m glad we’ve all helped the premed student with his or her personal statement. I’m not going to take down dozens of thoughtful responses, but I would like to register a heaD-shake of mild dismay."
medicine,"It’s always oddly reassuring to me when cranks manage to not hold one dangerous view while otherwise going along with reality. They somehow usually find a way to embrace *everything* that goes against evidence.

It makes it easier to tell the mistaken and the scientifically conservative (I’ll give Ioannidis credit for that) from the counter-scientific."
medicine,"Unfortunately, posting an entire article is copyright violation and gets the subreddit in trouble. I have to remove this comment."
AskDocs,How would you not know? The easiest way is to request hospital records from wherever it might have been done.
AskDocs,"Confusion during and after hospitalization is common, and the term for medically-caused rapid-onset confusion is delirium. Some things can make it more likely. Anesthesia and surgery are some of those things. Unfortunately, while he needs to be in an environment that can provide rehab and care, unfamiliar and confusing surroundings can also prolong delirium.

If this is entirely delirium, it should improve, but it’s not linear. It can take days or weeks to get mostly back to normal and months to fully go away."

AskPsychiatry,"Less flippantly, there are not clear, severe long-term effects from safe benzo tapers. Whether benzos have a long-term risk after use, and if so how high the risk is, remains unclear; the literature is mixed on it.

There is risk of severe acute harm from stopping unsafely. There is not clear risk, but there is potential risk, from stopping gradually and safely."
AskPsychiatry,"Dementia can have an onset at any time. It becomes more common with more advanced age, but even ""normal"" dementia can have onset in 60's.

The falls are very likely caused or contributed to by diazepam, and they can also be contributing to confusion, especially if he has had head injuries.

AskPsychiatry,"Except in states that have changed regulations for COVID, it is illegal to treat a patient by telehealth who is not physically located in a US state where the psychiatrist has a medical license. It is likely even more illegal to practice medicine for a patient located in a country in which a physician does not hold a license.

There are times when the rules are against common sense and good care, but I don't think the psychiatrist is wrong here."
AskPsychiatry,"Potentially. Benzodiazepines can cause and worsen psychosis, and diazepam is very long-acting. It's possible that he converted doses wrong and is now chronically psychotic. The timeline isn't highly suggestive, though: it sounds like the medication change was months before the paranoia and behavior change.

Any other medications could be contributing. So could other illness. Dementia is a possibility, but there would usually be other indications before paranoia and aggression.

This would be hard to figure out over the phone second-hand; trying to do it through you as an intermediary is impossible. It would be helpful for him to see a doctor who has his full medical record, including all medications, to try to sort things out."

AskPsychiatry,It can cause death. So... yes.
AskPsychiatry,"Consider not what you enjoy but what you least enjoy. Do you find managing chronic diseases when patients won’t do what you tell them infuriating? Family and (outpatient) psychiatry are going to be rough. Does suicidality make you nervous? Psych might leave you constantly disquieted. Does having your time wasted anger you? I’d steer clear of emergency departments everywhere.

The other element is what’s fun not just now but for coming decades. Some of that isn’t predictable, but try to imagine managing bread and butter day in and day out for years. Go with least boring and most satisfying to you."

For the record, I found 16 hours nearly as miserable as 24 hours, and I would rather work longer to spare someone else. The way call worked when I was doing it, it was uncommon not to get any sleep, but it was also extremely rare (as in I can count on one hand) to get more than a few hours."

medicine,"USA:

The idea of the black weekend comes from the common schedule of working half the weekend time with a four week rotation. One ""black"" weekend with both days worked, one ""golden"" weekend off, and two gray or silver weekends with one day worked and the other off.

Post-residency it tends not to work like that, and not all specialties use the same system. For psychiatry, for example, I had no black weekends because weekend call was always overnight call. A weekend might be ruined, but it was never technically black.

The bottom line is yes, for residents a weekend entirely off isn't a rare thing, but it also isn't the norm, especially with smaller residencies or covering big inpatient services."

Floradix looks like it’s an expensive “natural” formulation of iron gluconate plus some other irrelevant stuff. Save your money and buy cheaper iron gluconate.

Orange juice isn’t a bad idea, though. Vitamin C increases you ability to absorb non-heme iron (the kind that isn’t from meat or made to be meat-like)."

AskPsychiatry,"I work in a large hospital system and all of my patients are either insured or provided free care.

The idea of not taking insurance is problematic. If all psychiatrists did, it would collapse the utility of insurance. But having worked with insurance... it's terrible. I have to spend time learning and knowing how to write notes that will satisfy insurance, and then I still make mistakes and have insurance decide not to pay. It's a waste of time that could be spent helping patients, and for the privilege of getting jerked around the reimbursement is insulting.

The system for insurance works off the back of other departments. Surgical procedures underwrite psychiatry.

In private practice, as long as I could build an adequate panel, I could easily see myself getting fed up with insurance games and insisting on cash only. Not so much about the money, although the money is nice, but because insurance is a nightmarish bureaucracy that exists in part to make care *less* accessible.

An older psychiatrist who I look up to and respect very much laid it out like this: he sees cash-only patients, and he uses that money to underwrite patients with reduced or no fee. He can then make a living, do good for the underserved, and not have to fight with insurance overlords. (He didn't mention prior authorization for medication, though. That's still likely a problem.)"

AskPsychiatry,"It's not true or untrue in a factual sense, because it is not a testable set of hypotheses. Famously, in laying out the doctrine of falsifiability, Karl Popper explicitly called out psychoanalysis as non-scientific. (That perspective, and Popper generally, are not without controversy.)

What psychoanalysis can be is testably effective or ineffective, although given the intensity and duration of treatment it's also difficult to do. That said, psychoanalysis does appear to be an effective intervention when used.

My own opinion, non-scientifically, is that the unconscious, including transference and countertransference, is a useful construct for understanding thought and mood. I'm less sold on the Oedipus complex.

Narcissism has taken on a large life of its own outside of classical analytic approaches, and you don't need Freud or his descendants to formulate it, believe in it, understand it, or address it."

In addition, if we had posts for all healthcare workers behaving terribly, Meddit would be nothing else. If you need to vent about it, do it in the COVID megathread."
medicine,"It added an extra angle of racism against any Asian-looking healthcare workers for being a “China flu” carrier back early in the pandemic, but that’s died down what with China being mostly okay and America generally being awash in virus everywhere.

Mostly I think it’s the usual disappointing mess of racism. You ran into some, but it doesn’t strike me as anything shockingly out of the ordinary. That has been happening forever.

Trump’s presidency has emboldened explicit racism, but you’re not even describing that. This sounds like the casual implicit biases that doctors are white men, so everyone else isn’t a doctor.

If it helps, that seems more prevalent among older patients. Younger ones have figured out that doctors come in more variety now."
AskDocs,"Not my area of expertise, but mostly a ton of money, actual and in potential market value, has been thrown at making this go quickly. What’s missing, inevitably, is long-term follow-up. We can’t know whether there’s a side effect that appears years down the road because those years haven’t happened.

It’s unlikely and there’s no strong biological plausibility, but there’s no perfect prediction. That’s the risk. I’d still take the vaccine."
AskDocs,"It’s really not individual or genetic, it’s biology. Scar tissue is a distinct tissue type. It can’t do the work of specialized tissue. In the case of heart muscle, that’s why a heart attack can cause later heart failure. In the case of skin and muscle, scar simply cannot be as good."
AskDocs,"Unfortunately, electronic medical records are pretty much uniformly terrible. They’re incredibly user-unfriendly and clunky. Removing information even when everyone agrees that it’s wrong can be an impossible task. Yes, even when it’s basic stuff like the wrong patient’s info being entered in the chart or a chart being split improperly into two separate “patients” with identical names and dates of birth.

I wish I had a better answer."
AskDocs,"It depends on the kind of CT. You can look up the dose, but the bottom line is that your risk is statistically increased, but by so little that no, you shouldn't expect anything. If you do eventually get cancer, it would almost certainly be for the same bad luck reasons as everyone else and not attributable to the scans.

A CT of the abdomen and pelvis is roughly 8-10 milliSieverts, so you got about 50 mSv, which is equivalent to about 10-20 years of background radiation exposure. That's also the FDA maximum allowed annual exposure for workers. It's less than the exposure of people near the Fukushima disaster, which was dramatic but has not produced any detectable increase in cancers."

Due to an understandably high volume of posts regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, temporary rules have been put in place to organize the posts and maintain some of the usual character of the subreddit as a professional and social forum for physicians and other healthcare workers. 

Please see the temporary Rule 11 in the sidebar: 

* Posts or comments from users seeking to donate time or equipment must be posted elsewhere, eg /r/CoronavirusArmy
* Quick questions or individual resources (website, handout, etc) regarding COVID-19 should be shared as a comment in the COVID-19 megathread
* Brief suggestions, ideas, shower thoughts, and anecdotes regarding research or treatments that could help with coronavirus should be shared as a comment in the COVID-19 megathread
* Obiturary and memorial posts for healthcare workers are being collected at /r/medicinememorial

**For the above reasons or due to moderator discretion for any post related to COVID-19, please post otherwise rule-abiding material as a comment in the megathread rather than a stand-alone post.**

Someone needs to cover the patients, even just for emergencies, every night and every weekend and every holiday. There’s only so much trimming that can be done, and the only other solution is to hire more people to do it.

medicine,"Except in medicine everyone hits it big. Not Hollywood big, but every physician who works as a physician makes physician money, which is good money. It is, in fact, the highest-paid job on average.

Whether that’s enough after years of foregoing any income in favor of racking up debt can be debated. My argument is yes, but procedural specialties should make less so that primary care and hospitalists can make more. Although I’m biased, I’d course. Still, working doctors aren’t poor."

There's nuance here. Accepting some risk as the hazards of the job doesn't mean accepting all risks, unmitigated, because heroism. There are things that we do, and should do, that other people don't, and that's okay. That is a kind of heroism, if you look at it right.
