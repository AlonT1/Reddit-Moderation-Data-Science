AskDocs,"20-year-old female, the chance of stomach cancer is very very very low. H pylori is sometimes resistant and requires an additional round of treatment. Good luck."
AskDocs,"That’s an interesting cocktail of medications. Not sure why he gave you an NSAID and Tylenol together, but by the names of medications this isn’t in the United States (unless just misspellings)  

But your symptoms - fever, headache, body pain, ‘restrictive’ bowel movements for around 3 days. is atypical after spicy foods to my knowledge. 

To answer your question - no hemorrhoids are not the cause of your symptoms. You likely had gastroenteritis, now taking laxatives causing watery diarrhea and/or antibiotics can be causing the diarrhea.  Or the more serious option is you have some sort of bowel obstruction but it’s not a complete obstruction as evident by your ability to pass watery stool. So I would say say no emergency room or surgery is necessary  - see your primary care doctor to make necessary adjustments to the current medications.

Good luck"
AskDocs,"Probably a ganglion cyst. Stop wearing formal shoes if you can. Otherwise, see your primary care doctor."
AskDocs,"Oh, it stopped? I was thinking of acute pancreatitis, but it went away. With your history of medical problems and medications, I would suggest seeing your primary care doctor. Maybe get an abdominal ultrasound."
AskDocs,need to throw all the blankets/etc with the bed she is sleeping on. it looks like bug bites.
AskDocs,"I would go see your primary care doctor. Any family history of colon cancer? (Not in ANY way saying you have this) With the weight loss, you need to see a doctor. Good luck."
AskDocs,I agree with the other physicians.
AskDocs,About 1/10 on Truvada can have diarrhea. How long have you been on this for?
AskDocs,"This can happen with pneumonia (without knowing any of your social, family history or medications). Take your steroids and antibiotics as prescribed."
AskDocs,"Your BMI is around 18 - considered underweight. Please make sure to get adequate nutrition, and drink enough fluids during the day. I am happy you are quitting smoking and this will be crucial to your long term survival.

Have you tried a Holter monitor to monitor your rhythm at home? Is it just PVCs? Are you on any medications? Are you having chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting during these episodes?

I can't give you a definitive answer of what you are experiencing, but if it happens with exertion like you describe it sounds due to low oxygen delivery to tissues. Ferritin of 19 is very low, what was your serum iron and total iron-binding capacity? Hemoglobin (transporter of oxygen to our tissues) goes hand in hand with Iron (which your stores - ferritin - are depleted).  See article and let me know as this may fit your symptoms. Good luck.

AskDocs,"I would lay off so much magnesium as it is clearly not working. Increase your fiber intake, you can always take a Metamucil supplement if needed. Use the Miralax, keep drinking water, be active, and if worst comes to worst - see your doctor for further recommendations. I would be surprised if the Miralax, Activity, Water, and Fiber did not work. The fact your passing gas is good. good luck."
AskDocs,Any orgasm is going to feel uncomfortable. I would not advise doing so.

Lots of sharp nerve pains, especially when applying pressure to my temple/head region. Also occurs at random times as well. **- So this pain is mostly in the temple/head region?** 

Foggy memory - **What medications are you on?** 

Thinning, bony cheekbones(lost of soft tissue), loss of soft tissues in the neck, loss of soft tissue through my body including sharp pains, (ribs, neck, legs, shoulders, pecs, temple, etc...) - **I am not sure what you mean by this, thinning/bony cheekbones/loss of ""soft tissue"" -- I do doubt this with your BMi being 27.1** 

chills throughout body **- When do these typically occur? At night?** 

joint pain, wrist, elbow, back, etc -- **Is it worse in the morning? Worse after working? Random?**

loss of nerve sensation. I have somewhat of erectile dysfunction and I barely feel any nerves in my penis; unable to control my fingers at times. There are times where it's difficult to maneuver my fingers on my iphone or if im using a keyboard - **Negative EMG, MRI's... Loss of nerve sensation - for starters - Can you feel your feet?** 

**Tests I've done:**

MRI's(2 and half yrs ago), Sleep Apnea tests(1.5 year ago), Brain/Memory Tests(almost 2 yrs ago), blood tests for everything under the sun: lyme disease, diabetes, std's, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Thyroid, blood cell tests for cancer as well. I've also done and EMG as well. **ALL Negative**

AskDocs,Ah yes. Ask your family line about Mediterranean anemia :) good luck!
AskDocs,You may already have hyperthyroidism based on your symptoms. See your primary care doctor !
AskDocs,An echocardiogram is a test to look directly at the structure of the heart. without getting into dense details - echocardiogram uses ultrasound waves to allow visualization of the heart + does not have radiation +  will be the go-to test in your situation :)
AskDocs,Looks fine with the hemoglobin within the normal range. What ethnicity are you? Any family history of blood disorders? It is a possibility you have a mild form of thalassemia that is not of concern for you but more for educational purposes. The high RBC + low MCV are typical findings.
AskDocs,Good job young docs !
AskDocs,“When she would test” - this very well could be an anxiety issue but we would need more information —- to start her blood pressure readings in which scenario. Thanks
AskDocs,Likely anxiety if no family history of early cardiac disease. Relax and stop smoking.
AskDocs,"Seems related to the anemia. I would need more information about the headache- duration of symptoms, severity, any prodromal symptoms (nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness prior to onset of headache), how many per week or month?  
Thanks and good luck."
AskDocs,"You were on testosterone for a while, and stopped abruptly it seems? Lot of your symptoms could be due to just that. You're likely to feel terrible after taking it for so long and stopping. Your chance of terminal colon cancer is very low. If a history of receptive intercourse, however, I would recommend getting at least a rectal examination by a physician to rule out any abnormalities within the rectal area/externally.   Otherwise, try to relax - this doesn't sound like you're dying from a terminal illness. Just see a doctor in person :)"
AskDocs,"It looks like you're having an allergic reaction. Anything new in your diet, medications, laundry detergent, etc? Do you feel any sensation of your throat closing, swelling of your lips or tongue?"
AskDocs,Doesn't sound like a torsion. any recent sexual encounters? sounds more like epididymitis. good luck!
AskDocs,Closing this post as the edit is sufficient and far too many non-verified user comments. Good luck OP.
AskDocs,"It is not exactly an emergency seeing as it has been going for months. But it absolutely requires attention from a medical professional.

&#x200B;

Congratulations on your weight loss. That is amazing for your health. I wish you luck."
AskDocs,"I have seen this thousands of times and I truly understand the financial difficulties that my patients experience. But at the end of the day - if he is having a HEART ATTACK and he is not ok with dying in this scenario (He does not have a ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ advances directive) -> then he needs treatment now  regardless of the debt if you want him to live. 

I am sorry for being so blunt but reading the severity of your post I have to be. Good luck."
AskDocs,"Listen to this and please listen fully. 

Hospitals are meant for all patients. As an emergency room doctor - I do not care if you are insured or uninsured if you present with a heart attack as I’m going to treat you exactly the same. Take your dad to the hospital now if that is what happened - he is very high risk for death in the next 24 hours.

This is NOT something to mess around with."
AskDocs,"Listen - you’re young and smoking is the worst possible thing you can do for your health. Will it really “fuck up your entire medication plan” - no. Just stop smoking and the issue is solved. 

Every doctor is going to tell you to not drink or do drugs or at least I would hope lol"
AskDocs,"Why are you on tinzaparin? Likely you’re fine that doesn’t sound like high velocity trauma but unable to give you definitive answer and only giving you answer based on your word description . Any worsening symptoms (headache, speech change, dizziness, weakness, visual change) see a doctor"
AskDocs,Just likely skin thinning or atrophy. Just use regular sunscreen and aloe Vera if sunburn. No reason to use these creams.
AskDocs,"This is an odd medical question. You are overthinking this man. From what you are saying, You are fine. See your PCP"
AskDocs,"Likely over thinking things. Why do you think shigella ? I’ll be there tons of different fecal oral bacteria, I wouldn’t worry directly about shigella. I would just recommend next time please wash your hands before you do anything like that."
AskDocs,Have you tried taking a laxative or eating more fiber ?
AskDocs,"If you are weak, dizzy, and nauseous - and it is concerning to you -- seek medical care. We cannot give you any other answer than that on here. I hope you feel better."
AskDocs,"\*Rolling my eyes\*

Find a new primary care physician. Edema and Hypertension in a patient at your dads age, BMI (35, which is obesity).... It is a cardiac (heart) condition until proven otherwise.

I cannot believe they only ordered an ultrasound of the legs like LOL. Please make sure he can walk from the kitchen to his bed without shortness of breath. And find a new primary care doctor."
AskDocs,No. Deleting. Just no. Please don't. It will be detrimental to your health.
AskDocs,"I wouldn't drink baking soda to throw up. I doubt they are the cause, but I wouldn't take the pre/probiotic mix and Metamucil and see how your body responses. Drink lots of water, and eat light food or stick to a liquid diet.  If you're a smoker, you need to stop smoking. Try tums or over the counter antacids. See your primary care doctor."
AskDocs,"I wouldn't use both Pepcid and Pantoprazole together. I would suggest starting one or the other. Pepcid may act quicker (and at night), while Protonix (Pantoprazole) is overall better but will take a few days for full antisecretory effect. For the interim, take rolaids, tums, or Maalox for relief now. Good luck ! 

&#x200B;

(Using Protonix or Pepcid while taking Solumedrol is fine)"
AskDocs,"You're jaundiced, with a known alcohol withdrawal seizure one month prior? Yes, being blunt, yes you should be worried. Is your abdomen swollen or 'bloated' as well? Jaundice is not normal, especially if you're a heavy alcohol drinker. You are likely developing alcoholic hepatitis and require urgent, I would say immediate, care. This isn't urgent care worthy anyway, it is in ER worthy - just like the seizure was."
AskDocs,Steroids can worsen acid reflux by increasing stomach acid. Take some tums or pepcid.
AskDocs,"The gallbladder polyp is 8mm. It is your choice to get the gallbladder removed, but the polyp can be precancerous and hence why they usually tend to remove the gallbladder with any polyp >10mm and is up to the patient (thought recommended) in those with a polyp 6-9mm."
AskDocs,"No, Deleting. Relax."
AskDocs,"Hematuria, Inflammatory marker elevation, Hypoglycemia, Myalgias -> Absolutely need to rule out autoimmune conditions. 

If you could provide any blood work, medical history, social (smoke, drink, drugs), family history, any medications you are on - it would be beneficial to a more thorough answer."
AskDocs,"No one knows. Could be months, could be tomorrow. I wish you the best. Take care of yourself."
AskDocs,"Who is his PCP? This cannot be an MD/DO? Hypertension and edema in a 63 yo male and they didn't want further tests other than an ultrasound of his legs to rule out a DVT (which is not common bilaterally).....

They started him on Valsartan and an antidepressant after the ""ankles"" which I'm assuming you mean the edema?

Huh? Is he having any shortness of breath?

What are his medical problems? Does he smoke, drink? What is his weight?

He needs further workup. CMP, proBNP, Chest x-ray to start."
AskDocs,Stop the bactrim for now. And see your primary care physician for repeat labs
AskDocs,"Appendicitis is absolutely possible at your age. However, you do report a pretty drastic change in your diet which could be leading to your bowel symptoms. If you are worried I do recommend seeking care."
AskDocs,"Your iron saturation is remarkably high, with the elevated ALT and bilirubin (though mildly elevated) ->  You need to undergo testing for hemochromatosis. Is there any discoloration of your skin? Joint pain? Is there family history of liver disease? thanks."
AskDocs,"I wouldn’t say this sounds like an laryngospasm or esophageal spasm really... this sounds very much like an anxiety attack.  105/60 blood pressure is not low. The heat rate of 138, shaky, blurry vision and dizziness can definitely be due to the suspected hyperventilation and thus cerebral hypoxia (from your breathing not an organic issue). I would see your primary care doctor, please, for further work up."
AskDocs,"Resting heart rate 90-110 bpm? How many times are you checking this in a day? Do you have discomfort in your chest, or shortness of breath worse with movement? 

You say very very concerned and anxious - this can also raise your heart rate!"
AskDocs,Need to provide Age/Sex/Height/Weight... etc. See AskDocs rules.
AskDocs,"Sounds like a muscular strain. Apply heat, over the counter gels like icy hot, and ibuprofen. Stay hydrated. Avoid further heavy lifting until resolved"
AskDocs,"Plan of care for you: 

See your primary care physician. If necessary - referrals to an ophthalmologist for an eye examination (as stated below), and to a neurologist for a thorough examination and potentially EEG to r/o absence seizures. Good luck !"
AskDocs,"Do you have family history of early heart damage? Like a  relative (mom, dad, uncle, aunt, sibling) with an early heart attack? 

More likely would be your stimulant use and anxiety. Definitely avoid taking Vyvanse and drinking Red Bull’s. That can 100% cause paranoia . Good luck"
AskDocs,"First I am sorry to hear this unfortunate news. Subdural hematoma‘s are common in our elderly population especially after traumatic falls like your grandmother experienced. Each neurosurgeon is different and recommending surgery for patients. If clot thickness is >1cm, or midline shift >0.5cm then surgical evacuation is typically recommended.

The most important prognostic factor usually are age and neurological status. Therefore it is nearly impossible and would be wrong for me to give you an exact prediction of her odds for making a full recovery. It will be a long road to recovery - she will need physical therapy and cognitive stimulation daily. But be optimistic, listen to the physicians and hope for the best. Good luck and I wish for a speedy and full recovery."
AskDocs,"No way for us to give you a diagnosis without an image and/or rectal examination. If it is an perianal  or perirectal abscess then it needs to be drained. Are you having systemic signs like fevers, chills, night sweats? If not drained, it can expand to these systemic symptoms. Good luck"
AskDocs,"Seems like you’re googling a lot since you are commenting “terry’s nails” as this is not common knowledge like abdominal pain is.. 

Anyways- my medical opinion - RUQ pain deep throbbing with palmar erythema and terry’s nails now - you either are developing cirrhosis (very unlikely at your age) but your description of symptoms id have to think is overstated.

I need your social history - alcohol use (fifth of vodka daily?) intravenous drug use ? Unprotected sex frequently?"
AskDocs,Deleting this post there is nothing wrong here and unneeded images/comments
AskDocs,So it swelled like 6.5 inches in diameter? That is very surprising and very swollen..  Can you walk on it? Deserves attention....
AskDocs,Highly doubt it. Eat some high fiber foods and you should be fine
AskDocs,It’s not prednisone withdrawals
AskDocs,See your primary care physician and Get a urinalysis (UA)
AskDocs,No it’s not jaundice.
AskDocs,Have other people told you have bad breath? Do you have acid reflux? Do you smoke or drink?
AskDocs,Eat healthy and stop drinking alcohol. Give it some time. You’ll be fine
AskDocs,Get a sleep study! “polysomnography”
AskDocs,"We are not trying to spark further fear in our other patients about this pandemic. As a 27-year-old with asthma, please just listen to the laws by your governor to stay at home and quarantine yourself. Avoid unnecessary exposures, and you should be fine"
AskDocs,What is your medical history? Up to date on vaccines? What about your lifestyle? Good hygiene? Shower daily? Wash sheets? Been outside with abnormal exposures? Thank you
AskDocs,Have you been eating the lead?  Or directly inhaling the dust and fumes ?
AskDocs,"Very surprised they sent him home after being positive for COVID-19, and on oxygen and plaquenil. This doesn’t make much sense to me as he would require absolute quarantine. The current recommendations are plaquenil for patients admitted to the hospital along with azithromycin. Haven’t heard of someone getting sent home with plaquenil. Regardless, it is doable. 
Plaquenil + 220mg zinc sulfate for 5 days. Avoid any exposures. Avoid NSAIDs. Adequate hydration. Use the oxygen as prescribed. Make sure he moves around and doesn’t lay all day unless he is that sick and if he is then go back to hospital. No one should be coming in/out or to your house and you should limit contact with him. Absolutely wear all PPE at all times in your house.  I wish you luck in this unfortunate situation"
AskDocs,"Try Nexium over the counter, or Omeprazole. I bet you will feel better. And of course, work on your diet has you are already aware."
AskDocs,"Abdominal pain, high fever, loose bloody stools. This sounds like an invasive acute diarrhea. Shigella, E.coli, Salmonella, etc. No definitive answer until you send for stool samples as your physician did. But identifying your risk factors is key. Any recent travel? Any recent camping or hiking events?  Any raw meats? Have you kissed any turtles? These will definitely help. Hope you feel better."
AskDocs,Inappropriate for this page.
AskDocs,"Do you have family history of early cardiac disease (dad, uncles, mom etc with heart problems at young age)? Have you had any recent travel? What has your diet been like? Have you experienced symptoms of acid reflux? A Burning sensation usually is not heart-related, and is more from acid reflux or some other gastrointestinal complaint."
AskDocs,Tight and cold right calf with a sedentary lifestyle.Sounds like a DVT but you are young and I assume healthy. But if you could provide past medical history or in other words your previous medical problems this would be helpful.
AskDocs,"Do you have any risk factors like recent travel, location, cough, shortness of breath, metallic taste in mouth, work exposures?  If you are worried - I would go get checked out. Better to be safe if you are feeling like something is wrong. As I always tell my patients - you know your own body more than anyone else! If something feels off, its time to find aid"
AskDocs,Do your take any over the counter medication for pain relief? How long have you been on the Pristiq?
AskDocs,"I'm surprised you even know what a bronchoscopy is at 16 years old, as I did not. But young lady this is extremely common. If no medical problems, as you did not state, you will be fine."
AskDocs,"How often does he undergo phlebotomies? And has he had these symptoms before? if so, what did they do for him? Good luck."
AskDocs,It should be fine. Have someone watch you if possible. Just remember to not do that next time.
AskDocs,"The labs you describe are very mildly abnormal. This is likely not a big deal, hence the reaction of your physicians. The cholesterol can be controlled with diet and exercise; the metanephrines are barely elevated (not a pheo); Triglycerides are related to diet;  Alk phos mildly elevated; A/G ratio is not something to worry about when at the level you describe; To really diagnose UARS you need an invasive polysomnography with esophageal transducer and full pneumotachograph (doesnt sound like you had this done)... Overall this really sounds like anxiety. It sounds like you've had every imaging test, and nothing has been found. Try to relax young man!"
AskDocs,"Eosinophilic esophagitis and an inflammatory bowel disorder like ulcerative colitis are showing that they often coexist. A recent study showed a 3-to-5 fold increase in risk of eosinophilic esophagitis in patients with crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. The weight loss could be due to any diarrhea, loss of appetite or other symptoms involved with your inflammatory bowel disease. But yes, vyvanse has a side effect of decreased appetite like most stimulants."
AskDocs,"Any comorbidity, treated or not, is a risk factor.  These are, unfortunately, chronic conditions that do not (majority of the time) go away. But if you practice social distancing, wash your hands, wear a basic mask if you have to go out in public, and are taking your medications are prescribed - you will lower any chance of this disease."
AskDocs,I doubt hand sanitizer would do that.  It sounds like an STD. What have they tested you for?
AskDocs,Testosterone deficiency. See your doctor.
AskDocs,It sounds like a form of obsessive compulsion. I would seek a physician for cognitive behavioral therapy and potentially a medication to help.
AskDocs,"Quarantine and being at home for prolonged periods can definitely bring on anxiety for multiple reasons. Do you have any family history of heart or lung problems? If not, I would say your risk of any serious issues is low. But regardless, there are multiple options to get checked out by a physician. Call your doctor and set up a tele health visit. Good luck."
AskDocs,Very low chance. Don’t be worried. Transient lingual papilitis much more likely
AskDocs,"What type of symptoms are you having? More fluid intake, more fiber intake, avoid straining, maintain good hygiene, can try ice packs. If worst comes to worst with bad symptoms - see a surgeon.  But first see your primary care physician."
AskDocs,Have you had a colonoscopy? Does the bowel movements stop when fasting? Any joint pains? Any rashes?
AskDocs,Every 50 mins or so stand up and move your body. Your just very sedentary and this can lead to your position. Anyone that sits at a computer for days will feel your same pain. More movement will help you a ton
AskDocs,No. Highly highly unlikely. Colon cancer would be near 0 unless you have a strong family history in early years of living like yourself.
AskDocs,"Ferritin level is very low. What about the rest of the iron panel? Serum iron, TIBC? Also would need to know about your menstrual periods, this is usually how young females become iron deficient."
AskDocs,Find a telehealth service online. Or go to the hospital. This is not a joke. Blindness can occur
AskDocs,"Quarantine life. 



But really - we can’t give you any more information by the information you provided. To start: Are you sick? Are you stressed?"
AskDocs,Ehhh sounds like bed bugs or scabies?? Would need photo. Post on here please for other doctors to see
AskDocs,PCOS is possible. You need to see your physician. I would avoid any over the counter medications. Weight loss and exercise are key for now until you see your doctor
AskDocs,See your primary doctor. Not sure why you’re up there anyway. This is not worrisome
AskDocs,Not cancerous. Stop the birth control. Lose some weight. Should not come back. Don’t drink for a while until you ask this to your gastroenterologist/surgeon/PCP and they say ok.
AskDocs,"Not a derm and photo is difficult to discern on phone but itchy, burning rash after hiking - your suspicion may be correct. I would see PCP"
AskDocs,Likely vaginal irritation. I would avoid intercourse and maintain good hygiene. Should improve
AskDocs,"Do you smoke? 
It is possible see your PCP"
AskDocs,It sounds like you were dehydrated and had some burning of concentrated urine. Nothing to worry about. Not a UTI
AskDocs,"You definitely need nutrition. You are severely underweight and are at risk for serious life-threatening complications. Please try to find an outlet to manage this PTSD. It can be overwhelming and feels like there is nothing else to do and the end of the world. But if this psychiatrist isn’t working then find another, seek support groups, seek social support, find a way to fight this. You need cognitive remediation therapy and this psychiatrist isn’t providing that move on. An NG tube isn’t what you need. If going down this route a peg tube is better option for slow reintroducing of food to prevent refeeding syndrome more comfortably. NG tubes are not tolerated well. 

Let me brutally honest - you have over a 12x risk of mortality than the general population. You need to find support, please. The wounds will heal if you can stop distractions and manage fear and the haunting past. You can find help, there is something out there for you. Don’t let this disease consume you."
AskDocs,"4 doctors and 2 ER visits I have to assume they have ruled out the life threatening emergencies - could you provide any Labs, Imaging or Medications from these encounters ?"
AskDocs,Prilosec or Nexium
AskDocs,You likely need an ear irrigation which can be safely performed by any urgent care center. There are multiple over the counter remedies you can google but if these don’t work then seek treatment.
AskDocs,Age and symptomatology - any acute coronary syndrome likelihood very low. Stop vaping and see if it improves.
AskDocs,"Any fevers, chills, night sweats?
Any social history - alcohol, tobacco, IV drugs?
You describe a possible abscess. Can’t really tell induration or swelling on the photo. You likely need oral antibiotics"
AskDocs,"Would have to rule out if you are pregnant, obviously low chance but always first and foremost. Not a gyno, but without other symptoms it very well could be stress related (have seen this multiple times in patients)"
AskDocs,There’s really no way for us to tell you what it is. But looking at your age and reported risk factors (family history?) - malignancy not likely
AskDocs,Nope get more sleep
AskDocs,NormaL
AskDocs,It sounds like inflammatory bowel disease ... ulcerative colitis - no report of this on biopsy?
AskDocs,"Sounds more like allergies 4 times, runny eyes and nose, no reported antibiotic use"
AskDocs,"Flexeril usually helps sleep, at least in my experience. 2 hours a night is not good - do you have a primary care doctor? You are young - try some anti inflammatory medication like Aleve or Motrin. Use over the counter pain relief creams. Get a massage. Take a hot shower. Lastly Be active during the day and tire yourself out"
AskDocs, No way for us on here to tell you wholeheartedly whether this is serious or not. If it is bothering you then it is serious. Does this typically happen when you run? Cause I know for a fact when I run my heart rate shoots up as well. Very normal for this during physical activity. I would recommend stopping smoking if you are worried of respiratory illness.
AskDocs,"Start with reading about ‘sleep hygiene’ 
Limit caffeine
If not this then see PCP. perhaps switch the Zyprexa to Seroquel (more sedating)"
AskDocs,"It would be unlikely. The only plausible reason for this would be an infection, drug or overall inflammatory condition leading to myocarditis and heart failure. But most cases you would see EKG changes. I would search for other diagnoses prior to thinking it is heart failure."
AskDocs,"Interesting rash… looks similar to a “malar rash”… need to undergo autoimmune disease testing. Basics labs like CBC, CMP, lipid panel, TSH, UA, etc could very well be normal. Good luck"
AskDocs,Would recommend seeing primary doctor to rule out anything serious. Two episodes of 5 minutes of pain may be angina or may be stress. We can’t tell you definitively here. Please seek care.
AskDocs,Just see your general practitioner and get a one time dose of fluconazole.
AskDocs,Need to become verified to state this with credentials.
AskDocs,How long did they say the stitches should be there? Years seems far too long.
AskDocs,Cdc
AskDocs,I would see your GP
AskDocs,Do you have a hoarse voice as well?

AskDocs,It sounds like sleep apnea though
AskDocs,"Don’t listen to the techs normally, I’ve had this happen far too many times to count. Relax and await the official result"
AskDocs,Must mark NSFW
AskDocs,Needs further work up - have your primary care doctor send you to a cardiologist.
AskDocs,If you’re feeling bad - the first place to go is not the pharmacy to check your vital signs. Go to an urgent care or emergency department if worried . As for your symptoms - you describe lots of detail in this post and an anxiety component is definitely present. But I would suggest seeing your primary care doctor in the morning for further examination to ease your mind.
AskDocs,"Drink water, eat food and stop smoking marijuana. You’re young and don’t need this for anything right now. Please don’t take more than your prescribed dose for seroquel. This sensation you’re having, if worrisome, see your primary care physician. Just make these lifestyle changes and you will feel better"
medicine,"These comments have diverged from the essays non argumentative approach.

I’m not sure even about the argument here. Every occupation in this world has a hierarchy. The hierarchy (with describing in great detail) is based on experience, time and in this situation - quality education. There is no dispute or worthy argument against physician education and training. There is nothing similar. My wife is a PA and I have seen her training - while rigorous - there is a reason why PA is physicians assistant. There is no valid argument here."
Residency,"Spoke to Dr. Lake, and the original essay he wrote, to his knowledge, was “professionally edited” by some online editing company his friend recommended. He told me he thankfully received a refund as yes they did a poor job."
AskDocs,Polyps can be followed. Usually surgeons recommend gallbladder removal for polyps >1cm. See a gastroenterologist for follow-up to monitor.
AskDocs,"Young man, you are clearly way over anxious about fear of cardiac arrest. Why do you fear this? Why do you think it is possible for you? You are training for a half marathon and are motivated to do so. Do not let this anxiety hold you down. Seek help. This situation seems to be in your head and you would benefit GREATLY from cognitive behavioral therapy and an SSRI."
AskDocs,"Seeing as this is your cousin’s husband - I would need to speak to this individual and/or his wife for a real understanding of what is going. I understand your concern, but just knowing he has been using stimulant and sleep drugs for 10 years does not point me towards any relevant diagnostic direction. 

The sleep apnea -if untreated not using a CPAP - along with the sleep medication can definitely lead to poor respirations, daytime fatigue, headaches, and need for stimulant medication. Treating the underlying sleep apnea will likely improve all issues in this situation."
AskDocs,"AST/ALT are normal. Alk phos mildly elevated. Would doubt your “liver pain” and suspect it is more likely a gallbladder isssue. I mean it’s possible, but You’d be young for any liver damage despite your “binging on weekends”"
AskDocs,Like intercostal nerve injury. May receive alleviation from nerve blocks. See an orthopedic surgeon or pain management physician. Good luck
AskDocs,Would definitely need more information than this to give you any recommendation
medicine,A stellar essay by this young resident on the controversial topic of APRN independency currently being voted on in Florida!
AskDocs,"It is normal for our heart rates to increase with activity. How is your diet? Water intake? Activity level? How are you checking your heart rate and know these values so clearly? I would doubt SVT without other obvious symptoms. Your awareness of this does lead me to believe there is an anxious component here. But I would recommend seeing a cardiologist, as your primary care doctor said. It is possible it could be an arrhythmia so likely you will need a something like a holter monitor for 1-2 days to watch for this. Good luck."
AskDocs,Can cause worse side effects. Would recommend against.
AskDocs,"This is very common with these medications, unfortunately. 

Have to focus on the situation at end and not let your mind drift as it can on these medications. 

Good luck."
AskDocs,Get your thyroid levels checked
AskDocs,"""Lately I have been getting severe pain in my lower back and what I assume is my lower digestive tract and colon when constipated. It is so debilitating, it feels like ***my kidneys are rupturing***. "" The way you describe this leads me to believe a lot of this is anxiety. If you're not eating well and taking various vitamins daily - this can cause your gastrointestinal symptoms. As for your constipation - you need to follow a diet that consists of insoluble fiber that will surely help you pass stool.  Constipation can cause all of the symptoms you're stating about extreme pain. It sounds like you get relief with defecation, which also further states generalized anxiety issues along with irritable bowel syndrome can be the cause. I have multiple patients, and myself, have had similar issues so this is not me judging you but rather giving you a honest and professional opinion. 

You have severe depression and anxiety as you state- but do not take medications. Please please seek care for these issues, and I bet your other GI complaints improve as well. 

&#x200B;

Good luck : )"
AskDocs,Yeah you will be fine. Run this by your physician - but daily magnesium supplement can be helpful.
AskDocs,"to be clear : 

25 yo M - 5 year hx of testicular discomfort.

Now worsening RLQ abdominal pain, sent to ER to rule out appendicitis. Imaging was negative, but did show some type of venous problem in his testicular area. Sent home on Tramadol and pain is still bad.

Is it located in the same area? If it is horrible pain, serious toll on him - he should go back to emergency room. The testicular pain can definitely radiated into the abdomen and cause pain."
AskDocs,"CPAPs are much more advanced now. You do not have a full face mask anymore These are the absolute KEY to decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease, strokes, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and on and on. See a pulmonologist!"
AskDocs,A macrocytosis (high MCV) at your stage of pregnancy is common. No worries. See your OB GYN.
AskDocs,Not a question relevant to this subreddit.
AskDocs,She needs to go to the emergency department. This sounds more like a seizure. Please seek care now. This may be due to what you have stated - but she needs to be evaluated regardless
AskDocs,"Did not provide age.

&#x200B;

But to answer - this is nothing to worry about."
AskDocs,"Thank you for your submission.

Let me get this correct:

You had a beer with a friend on a Friday night. You do not like to urinate in public places, held it for a while ""Body was especially diuretic"" "" I have strong sphincters so when I am psychologically blocked, It won’t leak even a drop of urine. But I’d like to ask if my body has any last resource mechanism to let the urine flow when there’s no room for more in the bladder."" and bladder was hurting and now bladder is sore?

This is my opinion:

You will be okay. This sounds like a psychological issue. Anyone would have pain if they held their urine for a prolonged period of time. As for the soreness and cramping - Our brains can make us have any symptom we want to have. You will be perfectly fine. You don't need a catheter - that is not something you should be even thinking about.

I would recommend seeing a physician and explaining this problem. I have had multiple patients undergo CBT with resolution."
AskDocs,I would see your physician. Night sweats are common with viral infections - but if you are worried then see your primary doctor!
AskDocs,"""I was energetic, felt amazing, I've never felt so alive"" 

And wondering about addiction potential.... 

This is not a question for AskDocs. Will delete. 

Do not take unprescribed scheduled medications - these have serious addiction potential, and the way you're describing your euphoria (very common with this medication) is not something I would tell a doctor."
AskDocs,"Why do you take klonopin and ativan together? I understand your concern. I would not take these all together. Just to be clear:

Percocets + Klonopin + Ativan + Barbiturate + Marijuana, for a 20 yo 135 lbs male.

You should be seeing a pain management physician. Your concern is valid. These should not all be taken together. And if they are - you should be monitored closely for respiratory depression. Please see your doctor and readjust these medications."
AskDocs,Yes lol relax
AskDocs,Tell the doctor. They should be understanding. An antidepressant isn’t an opiate or benzo. While it is not the best approach - I’m glad you are finding relief. Just be honest with your doctor
AskDocs,No. You’re fine. Just don’t mix those again.
AskDocs,No not dangerous if that’s your schedule. Talk to your primary doctor and express this concern. But no it can be usually taken multiple times a day
AskDocs,"Nausea, GU complaints. Should seek medical care. Could be epididymitis, pyelonephritis, UTI. But since worsening - warrants evaluation."
AskDocs,"Not question for here. This is unknown topic, but limit secondhand smoke."
AskDocs,Study was autocorrect from “sleep schedule” somehow lol. Please see your physician prior to your eating disorder worsening. This can be causing your symptoms
AskDocs,"You received no care after breaking your cheek bone into your chin? You didn’t stay in the hospital after surgery ? The surgeon said “oh you’re fine keep living?”………  you drank a nut and now it’s in your eye? Very confused……something sounds off here. How did you not follow up with your surgeon in his/her office after? Insurance issues? If so, find free clinics please! Surgeons are very involved in their patients care and I would be very surprised by the reaction you’re stating."
AskDocs,"You admit to sleeping in a weird position. You have a hypertonic muscle. Try heat like a warm shower, massage, relaxation techniques, over the counter muscle topical pain relief."
AskDocs,"That’s a common finding and no worry at all. Take deep breaths, use incentive spirometry at home (ask doctor) and don’t be worried"
AskDocs,Looks like an external hemorrhoid with possible anal fissure around the 11/12 area. See your GI or pcp.
AskDocs,Have you been eating ok? What about your sleep study? What about any new medications? Have been drinking good amount of water? This sounds like nothing infectious and more de conditioning or immobility and dehydration.
AskDocs,"This means it is a premalignant precursor to cervical adenocarcinoma. You need a colposcopy or ECC for biopsy and officially diagnosis.  There is multiple treatment options for this, and I will not go into details and recommend talking to OB GYN physician. I wish you luck"
AskDocs,No no. You admit to poor sleep. Try to relax and Sleep. Try not to be stressed. You’re not developing anything chronic in that short time. Calm down your mind and you will feel much better. Good luck
AskDocs,"Hello. Would need to know your weight, current glucose level, and what you plan on eating. Insulin pump malfunction can lead to diabetic keto acidosis. So please please monitor your glucose levels very close and use your Lantus until you can get a doctors appointment ASAP.   The scale you state is a good start. 


Regardless, even though I am very knowledgeable in diabetic care, I recommend calling the manufacturer of the insulin pump and calling the endocrinologist (or your PCP) answering service if not open. 

Good luck"
AskDocs,What medications are you on?
AskDocs,"This actually isn’t true. OP states oral sex without use of protection. There is still a chance of transmission, about 4/10,000. Saying “you cannot” is too definitive and not true. And without stating you’re not a doctor is unfair to OP."
AskDocs,"See your cardiologist, this is an abnormal finding consistent with coronary artery disease, with prior MI"
AskDocs,"Black vomit probably is something you consumed. Any abnormal color to your stool? It is could’ve been the wine if red or the food you ate.  Was it black or did it appear like coffee grounds ?
You’re young, and didn’t really drink that much. I don’t know about your history other than what you’ve said - sure you may have a peptic ulcer bleeding and much less likely variceal bleeding. I don’t know enough to not tell you to seek medical care. But the probability, based strictly on what you’ve provided, of gastric bleeding is low."
AskDocs,"This is a difficult question - and I can tell how hyper aware you are of this. I recommend you keep a blood pressure log at home. Take your blood pressure once in the morning and once in the evening (no more/no less) and record these on your log. Take this to your primary doctor and he/she will go from there. 
Good luck"
AskDocs,This is nothing to worry about young lady. Just don’t smoke ever again!
AskDocs,"Unfortunately, you must go to ER. Foreign object in your vagina can lead to multiple unnecessary complications. Realize it’s not embarrassing to medical personnel. I once had a patient in the ER with a gun in his rear end. Elf wouldn’t surprise me. Good luck"
AskDocs,Not a medical question use other subreddits
AskDocs,"Time. Try to drink some fluids like Gatorade, in sips until you can handle it. If you’re feeling increasingly weak, dizzy, and can’t keep anything down with constant vomiting &/or diarrhea for >24 hours - I’d seek care for antiemetics and some IV fluids. Otherwise - time is the main factor"
AskDocs,"The most common lung problem in SLE patients..... 
pleuritis.

AskDocs,In a 13 year old that it has been happening 7 days in?
AskDocs,"Need to know what medications you take daily. Suspect this is the cause. Your symptoms sound like excessive h2o consumption likely due to anxiety like symptoms which in turn could lead to electrolyte issues. Diabetes, sure, is possible but I would like to know more about your past medical history and medications. Thank you"
AskDocs,"You do realize it takes roughly 18L of water to cause a toxicity? And usually in a short span? 
He wouldn’t be constantly thirsty (unless in his age range a psychogenic problem) if he was hyponatremic from what you are saying. The body’s thirst-ADH axis would not be firing and he would be having diluted Polyuria due to the excessive intake. I will be asking you for your credentials in a message. Thank you."
AskDocs,"Did you seek medical treatment for your arm? Do you have a cast? If so, this warrants emergent  medical treatment as it may be cutting off flow to your arm OR you may be developing an infection"
AskDocs,"Yes... this is accurate.... 3x/day is a pill every 8 hours... 24 hours in a day divided by 3 = 8 hours 

This is normal."
AskDocs,"What other tests do you feel are necessary? 
A prostate and testicular exam are necessary, which most patients do not enjoy. Usually in your age range this is self-limited as you’ve stated. But if it is persistent than you should get tested for STDs. This is the work up in at your age.  You need these physical examination maneuvers along with a urinalysis and  STD testing (including HIV) -  these can tell us what the issue is. 

And usually your posts don’t get responded to because you don’t provide the necessary information. But I answered this time. Good luck"
AskDocs,You should see your primary care doctor. If you’re doing your own rectal examination on yourself and not a medical professional - you should be seeking professional advice as this could be more than just a hemorrhoid. Good luck
AskDocs,"What grade do you teach? I once dated a preschool teacher, and she would bring pick up a different viral infection every few weeks. Lot of these illnesses are spread by air and you being an asthmatic are prone to worsening types of these infections. The key is exposure. If a kid is sick in your room and this is happening frequently - ask him/her to wear a mask (or you) maintain good ventilation in the room and keep taking your asthmatic medications. 

If symptoms feel like worsening - go back to primary doctor or urgent care

Good luck"
AskDocs,"Well by the preeclampsia criteria - she actually fits this. The protein isn’t quite high enough (>300mg/24 hours) 
But she has the blood pressure (>140/90 at least 2 occasions at least 4 hours apart) and elevated creatinine (>1.1)

So her OB should address this further..  sounds like a milder form but she should at least speak about potential complications"
AskDocs,"Catecholamine surges basically like what you’re saying about “adrenaline”. One disorder that could fit under this category would be a “Pheochromocytoma” . 

Expand on your “heart pauses” I’m not understanding these much. 10-15 second pause at the ER?"
AskDocs,Worrying too much. Relax young man. Not mercury poisoning.
AskDocs,"Sounds like you were at risk for airway compromise. This is an ER issue, for sure. Urgent cares don’t typically have CT scans, Or even IV antibiotics. Sure it turned out to be a tonsil stone - but with your presentation the urgent care physician was not going to poke at it until an ER or likely an ENT physician saw you. So, in my opinion, it was warranted."
AskDocs,"Ha ha definitely can. If it doesn’t happen frequently and no symptoms other than some
Anxiety, I wouldn’t worry about it. The watches sometimes over read - I’m always Heart rate of 100+ and I check my own it’s in the 70s."
AskDocs,"heart palpitations, anxiety, headaches in episodic nature... along with weight loss. This sounds like a catecholeamine surge - have you had a work up at all?
Any family history of similar events? We need more information on your ER visits and any doctors you’ve seen. 


Please don’t be suicidal. There is help out there. You should not be suffering alone and there are doctors, like myself, that will do all we can to figure out the issue and get you back to living your life the way you want to."
AskDocs,Anything making you anxious? Any drug use? Where you eating? Basically Anything other just watching tv calmly?
AskDocs,Likely paranoid here.. kidney stones are typically much more noticeable. Any blood in your urine?
AskDocs,"See your primary doctor. ER visit not necessary unless she has an emergent complaint (like low blood pressure with symptoms) 

This needs to be worked up fully and with a good PCP and referrals to necessary specialists you can get to the answer on this. Good luck"

AskDocs,"Hey man, relax. These are extremely common in patients with smoke. Google always looks for the worst possible diagnosis. I wish people would understand this, if you search headache you have meningitis or a stroke. The only way to definitely tell you that this is not cancer it is a biopsy, which is what your doctor will run with the samples you have provided after removal. Sure there is a probability, how can you expect a doctor online to tell you no you do not have something? Your probability, from the little detail you have provided, it is HIGHLY unlikely to be a malignancy, regardless, what are you gonna do to change this at the present ? Don’t lose sleep over this, follow up with your doctor. 

Very proud of you for quitting smoking, and this is the best move for you at this particular time. Especially if it causes you this much anxiety. Definitely do not smoke. Good luck"
AskDocs,"You make it sound like you’re not eating for no reason and this is a problem. But then at the end you state that when you eat you feel terrible.. this is a sign to see your physician, and likely have a referral to a gastroenterologist. You may require a upper endoscopy to rule out things like peptic ulcer disease."
AskDocs,"Brown blobs...this needs a photo... mucous im guessing. No fever, chills, teeth shattering chills, cough, shortness of breath, headache, facial or dental pain, runny nose?"

Last sex January 15 2020 
2 days ago.... no this is not from pregnancy

If worried get an over the counter test!"
AskDocs,The positive response to corticosteroids leads me to believe autoimmune disease until proven otherwise. Rheumatologists are very intelligent physicians - negative testing doesn’t always mean you don’t have an autoimmune condition. Keep following up with these specialists and your primary care doctor - you will find an answer.

AskDocs,What is the altitude ? Did they do any imaging of your head ?If very elevated I would suggest descending as soon as possible.  This symptoms may be a sign of a larger issue than blood pressure.... (which is usually opposite of what you say)

AskDocs,"More would like to know leukocyte esterase, nitrites or bacteria on your urinalysis ."
AskDocs,"Don’t know much about your history. Looking strictly at your age, sex, and weight - the probability of a serious cardiac event is low. 
However, anytime you are worried and experiencing chest pain - it is usually better to go to the ER for reassurance to avoid future similar events."
AskDocs,"Why did you take 40 Zoloft pills? Yes you need to go the hospital. Who knows if you threw up all the pills. Please, please seek medical care."
AskDocs,"Take medications as prescribed, you will be ok. Don’t be worried, take dosage as ordered"
AskDocs,Sounds like a muscle spasm. Drink lots of water and try applying heat to the area.
AskDocs,You’re a teenager. Breast changes are very common. This lump is a normal part of puberty. If persists and become worrisome - see your primary care physician.
AskDocs,"There is no way for us to tell your odds. That is not possible. However, have you been tested for this prior? Are you having any odd symptoms every now and then? More sick over the past year? 
Regardless I wouldn’t freak out - you can’t change anything currently. Just call when you can and they will tell you what the labs show. If it’s a good doctors office, they are calling you to make you aware the labs have resulted. And it is almost 2020- you can see these results online most of the time, good luck"
AskDocs,"Not likely side effect of new medication, are you taking any other meds?"
AskDocs,"Good thing is it doesn’t sound infectious. This requires urologist to evaluate, of which I am not but it does not sound life threatening at all. Good luck"

AskDocs,"Have you been using any stimulants, like drugs or caffeine? Given your symptoms, I would suggest going to the hospital for further workup."
AskDocs,"People don't realize how strong the brain actually is. This sounds like you have had multiple negative workups for your palpitations.

AskDocs,"This is anxiety man, don’t be worried"
AskDocs,I have never heard of a patient telling me they have lower back lymph node swelling let alone being able to feel them
AskDocs,How did you measure them
AskDocs,"Hello,
Likely, given your history, this very well could be benign. However, it does warrant the further workup as stated. Get the testing done, there is no reason to sit here and worry - it is out of your hands in terms in diagnosing and treating any particular underlying condition. Relax and trust your doctors. If it was life threatening they would have told you right away. A good doctor doesn’t sugarcoat at all and all of us won’t sugarcoat when something is very serious."
AskDocs,"I’m sorry but this post will be deleted. It makes no sense.
You have 25cm lymph node swellings in your lower back? Nearly 10 inches? That’s not even possible. 
Please refine this and post again if necessary"
AskDocs,"What was the current reason to getting the blood work? 6 months duration of multiple, different symptoms is hard to discern. Are you currently experiencing fevers, chills, cough, runny nose, sore throat, burning when you pee, new rashes, etc

AskDocs,"Agree with above to not drink, but will try to get to the bottom of your complaint. First, Why are you on testosterone ? Very young to be on this medication"
AskDocs,What medications are you on? Get tested for diabetes too.
AskDocs,Need to listen to your doctor and do that testing. It’s not normal
doctors,Too fast. Seek care as stated above.
AskDocs,"Need to start with age, sex, weight, medical problems, medications for starters. and more details if we are to help"
AskDocs,"Would need more information. A good beginning would be: 

What is your weight? Are you diabetic? Do you have high blood pressure? Do you drink adequate fluids?"
AskDocs,Impossible to really know when to worry. If you are feeling very anxious then this CAN be the cause. But I would suggest going and getting that work up again. You may be having paroxysmal tachyarrthymias given the duration and spontaneous resolution.
AskDocs,Large leukocyte esterase with other abnormalities. Yes likely UTI. And culture grew an organism. Take your antibiotics!

AskDocs,"Heat rash or contact dermatitis. 

Either way, easily treatable and not serious conditions."
AskDocs,"This is some odd advice. 

There are other options for nausea/vomiting. This patient seems to have good follow up and specialists actively involved in her care. If Zofran doesn’t work and worried about tardive dyskinesia with Reglan - try compazine. I usually use this in my chemotherapy patients when zofran doesn’t seem to work well. Otherwise, continue your active work up. I wish you the best."

AskDocs,"Lots of poor advice here. Looking strictly at the information you’ve provided:
You got your flu shot, that is a good thing. 
You are overweight and smoke. And are young without other medical problems 
Realize, you have around the same probability of a widespread influenza virus infection than the general population.  And this is not something you should be worrying about at this moment. The probability is very low. Don’t believe everything on tv- youlll go crazy,"
AskDocs,"Take 1 iron tablet a day. You may be iron deficient from your periods, very common"
AskDocs,"Your case is very complex, and the end point here is multifactorial. You have had multiple ‘traumatic’  events (your injuries), and also an underlying autoimmune condition. Not to mention you’ve been on a ton of medications that have all sorts of side effects. At this point, I would highly suggest finding a primary care physician that will look through your file and will spend over an hour with you figuring this out. Could it be viral related? Sure… could it be medication related? Sure… could it be mentally related from all the events and uncertainty over the years? Sure… 
I am sorry you’re going through this, but I can assure you that if you seek answers - you will find someone to listen. I wanted to state this before your post is full of  people not willing to help rather they post their problems and somehow state they are related to yours. Then again, I hope someone on here is able to find an answer for you - but the complexity definitely requires in person evaluation with a physician willing to put the time in. I wish you luck."
AskDocs,"3.3mm is small. It’s likely passed without you knowing it. Relax, keep drinking water and again relax !"
AskDocs,"Your CBC looks fine. No abnormalities noted. I’m sure your symptoms probably come on during your periods. Try an iron tablet once daily, and this may help. Regardless, these labs are fine"
AskDocs,"Not sure what you have exactly. Bronchitis, maybe pneumonia.. without knowing the microbe I can’t really give you a true number. But rough estimate would be to lay low for the next 48 hours or so until your cough is under control as this would be one of the main ways you’d potentially spread your illness. Good luck"
AskDocs,"Changed your diet how so? 
Colonoscopy likely indicated, get that done.
Hemorrhoids don’t usually cause gas as you’re describing"
AskDocs,I would go see your doctor sooner than 1 month. No way for us to tell you exactly what is going on without a physical examination. You could have hemorrhoids and anxiety leading to poor oral intake for all I know. But with your family history I’d go see a physician. Good luck
AskDocs,"
Yes all of your symptoms could be stemming from the disease processes in your past medical history. Relax young man!"
AskDocs,Need antibiotics
AskDocs,Have they done an echocardiogram? You need to use a holter monitor at home for a short period of time to identify the heart rhythm during one of these episodes. Hard for the physician to identify the issue if you show up to his office normal. But your doctor should know his. Follow up and request further resting.
AskDocs,She likely had a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Basically she has no uterus to hold a baby nor has ovaries to produce eggs.
AskDocs,"Could have an infection, I would  seek care if worried."
AskDocs,"Could you type what medications you’re on and the generic/English name if possible?
Otherwise your labs look Fine other than a mild elevation of your liver enzymes, which could be due to your alcohol intake. Make sure to inform the UK embassy in Laos of your stay, and maybe they will also be able to provide you with areas to get adequate care."
AskDocs,"I would agree with your urologist. You do not have the symptoms of acute prostatitis, and idk if you’ve had a urine culture because the UA was negative but I also don’t think you have chronic prostatitis. But you would need a digital rectal exam to assess the prostate.  Otherwise, Continue to follow up with your primary doctor and urologist."
AskDocs,"If I am reading this correctly - you feel as though your throat is closing as you lie flat. Stop here, and go to the ER for further management. Only continue reading if your throat is not closing and is not associated with shortness of breath, abnormal breathing sounds, lightheadedness, dizziness, rashes, lip swelling, hives, itchiness, weakness, inability to take a deep breath or obvious respiratory distress 

Has anyone did a physical examination looking into the back of your throat? Have you had your tonsils removed? 

The “jerk” you’re describing as you’re falling asleep doesn’t sound like hypoxic jerks - it sounds like hypnic jerks. Make sure you’re limiting stress as well as you can, no smoking, limit caffeine especially before bed, and don’t use other stimulants. This may help. Hypnic jerks are common and can happen in anyone.

Lidocaine won’t help your throat closing. If true, again seek ER treatment."
AskDocs,"I was not there to see the impact of your head against the wall. If it hurts, and you are worried - you should seek treatment."

Tensión headaches are very common. Very very common in people like yourself very stressed completing a long road of education and now with lot of new opportunities. These are usually bilateral, and describe as “band like” around the head. Can treat with ibuprofen or even Tylenol. 
Cluster headaches are common too - sporadic one sided headache associated with watery eyes and excruciating pain. Usually treated with Triptan meds or just oxygen 
And you’re overloading the pain meds for these headaches, or drinking lots of caffeine - this could also be the issue.

Otherwise, no this is not a life threatening stroke you’re having. Be sure to follow up with your primary doctor to express your issues, but otherwise - drink some water, eat good, and get some sleep. Good luck!"
AskDocs,"No, not at all always cancer. How long has it been there? Husband is a medical physician? Sure, a lot of us basically throw our own health to the side and can be in denial - but he will get it checked when he thinks it is necessary. And if not - I’m sure you’ve made some friends with other doctors and/or their wives — have them examine him quickly. An educated doctor is able to tell a worrisome lymph node from a more common benign reactive node. Good luck. :)"

AskDocs,Do you have exposure to herpes ? Do you engage in anal sexual activity ? That would be relevant information.
AskDocs,"There is a different between unconscious from alcohol intake, versus unconscious from cessation of blood flow and cardiopulmonary failure. You were drunk, overly sedated.

You’ll be ok"
AskDocs,"Looks fine. Alcohol damage - with the amount of intake and no reported family history of congenial liver issues - you’re describing will take years to cause detectable liver problems. Plus you won’t always see on labs, imaging will first show fatty liver then Can progress. If you are this worried - i suggest stopping drinking all together. Good luck"
AskDocs,Please go to ER- tell them about the PTSD and they will provide you with comfort and treat your condition. No way for us on here to tell you what is going on - but with what you’re describing my recommendation is to seek care.

AskDocs,"You present a case full of multiple complaints and a very appreciated sequence of symptoms. However, these are all over the place and hard to pinpoint an exact area that is the primary problem. 
I would like to ask how is his affecting your daily life? Are you still able to hold a job? Are you sitting there, and questioning your symptoms constantly? are you able to hang out with your friends? Are you able to hold a normal conversation in life without mentioning the symptoms that you have? Does everything in your life concern around the symptoms? What do you think that the diagnosis is? What do you think is going on with your body? this is a lot of questions, but this may help you understand what is going on. Thank you for your case and I wish you good luck."
AskDocs,"What other medical problems does she have ? Any family history of similar issues? Any tobacco, alcohol, drug use? Any exposure to toxins or tick bites?

Any heart issues as a child?


With a heart rate of 39, without acute intoxication of some sort, she will likely require IV medication and/or transcutaneous pacing prior to evaluation by a cardiologist physician. If this has been recurrent - she may need a pacemaker.  I would suspect at least a few days in the hospital. 

Good luck"
AskDocs,Regular endoscopy with symptom relief with a proton pump inhibitor — gastroesophageal reflux disease sounds pretty consistent (likely saw some irritation on the endoscopy). Take your meds 30 minutes prior to eating consistently

That being said, you posted on here worried about your drinking therefore seek help in this and cut back -it is clearly a problem!"
AskDocs,"Concentrations of smoke components depends on: 
- Where smoking takes place
- Size of the area 
-Rate of exchange of air space with outdoor air 
- Presence and efficiency of air cleaning devices 

Also proximity to the smoker is important, 

Politely ask to not smoke directly near you, and preferably with garage door open or outside altogether — this will decrease your risk greatly.

AskDocs,"Not really, unfortunately. Broken ribs take their time to heal and adequate pain control is key.

Please seek care to evaluate if these ribs are broken, and to ensure there is no other injuries like pneumothorax, liver and spleen lacerations, that may accompany these fractures.

Otherwise, perhaps you could find a competent physician that would be willing to do nerve blocks. Otherwise, oral pain meds and time is the treatment."
AskDocs,"This is a case by case basis, thyroid surgery - taking thyroid hormone for the rest of your life. Not thyroid surgery - anxiety feeling of a large nodule that is “suspicious”…… how to solve this?

See a good endocrinologist who can give you their expert opinion on what the most appropriate next step would be. In the end, this is up to you (of course) but seek an expert opinion and have them explain in detail your options. Thyroid removal is not something to do without knowing the risks, complications and need for lifelong medication. Good luck"
AskDocs,Not a heart attack with your description of symptoms. Likely costochondritis. Try some aleve !

AskDocs,"Is Colonoscopy Necessary After Acute Diverticulitis?

Douglas K. Rex, MD reviewing Daniels L et al. Gastrointest Endosc 2014 Mar

—>Probably not, especially in patients who have already undergone a colonoscopy in recent years.

Some experts recommend that patients with acute diverticulitis undergo colonoscopy 4 to 6 weeks after healing to exclude malignancy as an underlying cause. However, some study findings have cast doubt on the need for colonoscopy in this setting.

In the current systematic review, investigators estimated the prevalences of colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas detected by colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis. In all studies, diverticulitis was documented by radiographic imaging, and computed tomographic imaging did not suggest the presence of cancer.

In eight studies comprising 1796 patients, the pooled prevalence of colorectal cancer was 1.5%, the pooled prevalence of advanced adenomas was 3.8%, and the adenoma detection rate was 14%.

COMMENT
The authors concluded that these data do not provide clear support for performance of colonoscopy after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, the prevalence of 1.5% for colorectal cancer would be high for a screening study. The decision regarding performance of colonoscopy should probably be individualized. Certainly, in a patient of screening age who has not had a previous colonoscopy, it would be reasonable to perform one. What this study does not address (and which seems generally unnecessary) is repeat colonoscopy in patients with simple acute uncomplicated diverticulitis who have already undergone examinations in the past few years. This issue should be further investigated.

Summary :  
Never had a colonoscopy but had an episode of diverticulitis? Get one


Had a recent colonoscopy and now an episode of diverticulitis? Don’t really need to"
AskDocs,"So in hepatic encephalopathy an ammonia level is helpful, but doesn’t truly guide treatment. This is more of a clinical diagnosis in a known liver cirrhosis patient that presents with altered mental status. He should be taking lactulose daily, and titrations to 2-3 loose stools daily. This should help with this mental status. If worsening, seek emergent care as this can lead to coma if not properly treated. 

Normal ammonia is roughly 15-40u/dL

And he must stop drinking alcohol or else things are going to get much worse"
AskDocs,"I wouldn’t exactly agree with above about having severe symptoms right away.  “chronic” subdural hematomas present with insidious onset of headaches, dizziness, somnolence, and cognitive impairment — potentially WEEKS after initial injury. 

However, in your case and being young, the probability of a subdural hematoma is lower. I would suggest getting a CT of your head if you are this worried to post on reddit. Good luck"
AskDocs,This ^
AskDocs," Could be seronegative RA. I would suggest still seeing a rheumatologist with your sx.

Also you could Try cymbalta for sx control, another possibility you may have fibromyalgia."

Or look at medications you’re taking
+ how do you know possible MTCD or ehlers?"
AskDocs,"No way for us to tell you, go get tested"
AskDocs,Have you been outside? Only on the one leg?
AskDocs,It’s a myth and is fine

AskDocs,"Is there anyway you have developed the ability to decrease your suboxone dosage and start to wean off? 4 years I would love for you to taper off all opiates if possible.  
In regards to your question about serotonin syndrome, I agree with the pharmacist as stated above. Good luck"
AskDocs,Continue current treatment. If you do not improve after finishing course of antibiotics - you may antibiotic adjustment to Azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone equivalent to treat Mycoplasma (aka walking pneumonia). Good luck
AskDocs,Glandular fever? As in infectious mononucleosis? Otherwise I’m very confused by your post - I’m based in USA 🤷🏽‍♂️
AskDocs,Unfortunately it is common if you had a tympanic membrane perforation. Depends on size and location . See the ENT doctor
AskDocs,Agree with above. Well stated
AskDocs,"Well the tech shouldn’t do that if trained properly and what exactly do you think they are lying about? Did they biopsy these enlarged nodes to find a lymphoma late? 
Lots of things can cause enlarged lymph nodes, doctors aren’t lying to you. Sonographers aren’t doctors."

AskDocs,What is this comment? Uhh
AskDocs,Fault in your vagina? I mean ask the male if it feels the same? I mean less lubrication of the internal vagina could lead to uncomfortable sex for both of you. But I think you two need to talk more about this issue - does not seem to be a structural issue.
AskDocs,"Yeah it would. 
And what? They don’t give medical records to patients? That’s interesting. See a different doctor. 
A complaint could be filed about this physician as it is unethical to not provide a patient with their medical records.
Good luck.."
AskDocs,"I mean it could be possible but I would first check stressors in life like family, friends, work, boyfriend, etc."
AskDocs,Could be. Either fix your neck pain with physical therapy and exercises. A medication like carbamazepine 100mg twice daily may solve your symptoms if does happen to be a form of Cranial nerve 5 neuralgia.
AskDocs,"Yeah, could be. Would have to do a physical examination to confirm. But yes see your Primary care doctor, may need antibiotics if over 10 days."
AskDocs,"Stop drinking, smoking and using weed. See if symptoms resolve."
AskDocs,"Not sure exactly what you’re trying to say here. But I would suggest adhering to a diet, and weight loss. This would decrease your risk of hardening of your arteries, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart attacks, strokes, etc. At your BMI of ~44, not now but in the future, you will have an elevated risk of these complications. Good luck."
AskDocs,"Have you seen a gastroenterologist? Get a endoscopy if worried. Weight loss, bloating - could be wide range of disorders e.g. celiac disease. With the fatigue stemming from iron deficiency which is common with celiac."
AskDocs,Yes I would suspect that to be the culprit. Takes a while to come back to normal(~2 weeks). Stay hydrated
AskDocs,What did your physician say? If worried get an echocardiogram
AskDocs,Anxiety. Deep breaths.
AskDocs,"No. You don’t have colon cancer. You probably have hemorrhoids. Constipation and Toilet paper can irritate the skin and you bleed. Relax, and if worried go see your primary doctor."
AskDocs,Any other symptoms? Or just a one time white spot ?
AskDocs,"I suspect you have an intrarenal problem from one of the medications and/or contrast induced injury (did you have a CT scan in the hospital for your obstruction?) 
Stay hydrated. Avoid ibuprofen (Aleve, Motrin, etc).  It should recover just fine."
DiagnoseMe,Sounds like your shoes are too tight. Not being sarcastic. Wear lighter and looser shoes and see if this makes difference. This does not sound like MS at all.
AskDocs,"1) why on Levaquin?
2) extreme nausea after eating - do you still have your gallbladder? Have you had an endoscopy? Any imaging studies of your abdomen? 
3) How long have you been having these symptoms?"
AskDocs,"Because its not needed for someone with flu or acute sinusitis. This is offered to patients who have recurrent sinusitis that is life debilitating for more than a few weeks (months, years) 

Intranasal glucocorticoids, nasal decongestants, and if needed - antibiotics - can handle this issue most of the time. And there is no need for intervention if you are able to pull mucous out or if you blow your nose and it expels. 

Sinuses are easy to touch but they, as do everything in our bodies, require us to insert a foreign object in order to directly visualize these areas.

Long story short - everyone gets viruses during the year. Stay hydrated. Wash your hands regularly. Blow your nose. Take the above medications as needed and rest."
AskDocs,"I don’t know where you are from, but you’re speaking in metric system values so I’m guessing not the USA, but here it usually goes:

AskDocs,"You’re pretty young for having diverticulitis. Not to mention right sided is odd... I would follow up with your gastroenterologist and undergo a colonoscopy in a few weeks. Otherwise  augmentin or cipro/flagyl is the usual treatment. Sure this increases risk of c diff and yes it would be ideal to not be on antibiotics. But I would need more information such as  any fevers, lab findings and radiographic studies to suggest not doing so."
medical,Go to ER. Could be abscess requiring drainage and/or IV antibiotics
AskDocs,"Have you been tested for Lyme disease or Borrelia miyamotoi disease? Any tick bites you are aware of? Any recent animal exposures? Any recent travel? 

And I would suggest getting further testing for possible forms of encephalitis if these are your symptoms you may require a brain biopsy."
AskDocs,Stop smoking marijuana. Any irritant to your lungs is not good with your current symptoms. If accompanied by fevers and chills - see your primary care physician.
AskDocs,May have some vitamin deficiencies. Please seek care with your primary care physician.

2) Herpes is easily recognized by an experienced eye.  But it’s also subjective - you put an idea into someone’s head you’ve been exposed to something they’ll be more likely to say that’s it. 
3) just wait on your test. Herpes isn’t a do or die diagnosis. Even if you have it, it can be suppressed with medications. 
4) Find a new medical professional. Don’t ever let someone who is supposed to respect your decisions and be your advocate - to disrespect you because of your sexual orientation. That’s ridiculous and makes me 🤬"
AskDocs,"Back pain and chills..,. No cough or shortness of breath? Any fatigue?"
AskDocs,"Shocks of pain doesn’t equal PID. Your story confuses me, because you included sepsis from a kidney infection which you state is unrelated to your Chlamydia diagnosis. What was the organism causing the pyelonephritis? if I am viewing this correctly - sepsis from kidney infection, you recovered, and then got Chlamydia + treatment with negative post antibiotic testing.  
For reassurance, your symptoms do not fit a PID diagnosis. Yes, you have increased risk with your history of Chlamydia, but that’s the not the cause of what your shocks of abdominal pain."
AskDocs,You had epididymitis. Don’t worry about recurrent random pain. Happens to all guys.
AskDocs,See your primary care doctor. Nothing serious.

AskDocs,"Is it smooth, fluid filled, or scaly? Where is it located? Any other symptoms (is it itchy or painful)?"
AskDocs,"Few hours ago and now symptoms. Not cat scratch disease as stated above, too acute. He developed runny nose, sneezing and hives. Now developing arthalgias. He more likely is having an allergic reaction. Benadryl was a good first choice. You are likely ok with watching him for tonight. But if you notice that he is at any point he is struggling to catch his breath or looks like he is having trouble - go to ER."

AskDocs,Does this run in your family? 30s is low. You need to be monitored for this closely. And if true you need to be evaluated for advanced treatment. Stop the klonopin and follow.

AskDocs,Do you have a mechanical heart valve?
AskDocs,"You need a full physical examination. I don’t want to be bearer of bad news but if testing so far has been negative you need a workup for malignancy. Any trouble swallowing, fevers on and off, testicular mass, or family history of cancers? Your case needs further workup."

AskDocs,"Remember that posting here on AskDocs, any opinion should come with someone’s credentials. Those posting without this should be stating to you they are not a physician.

In your case, you’re young and without history of early heart disease in family members, high blood pressure, a cholesterol hereditary disease, or history of congenital heart disease I would say this is anxiety about your exams and to take a deep breath… Sounds like you’re preparing for them, be confident and you’ll do fine :)"

Zosyn is very common to give for prophylaxis of any intraabdominal infections that could ensue with his condition (if he isn’t already febrile, with a high white blood cell count)…….

AskDocs,"I’m sorry about this unfortunate situation. I will give you my opinion here, but this will definitely require further workup by your primary care physician. If she has been faithful it would be odd to have  the positive test and a rash as you describe. You don’t happen to know what the test was, was it the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) ? Lots of false positives with this test. But with her symptoms has described it requires confirmatory testing.

I cannot give you a definite answer based on your post, but looking at her age and risk factors - heart involvement is not common. Good luck. And relax.

Of course you have history of cancers in your family - but I can’t think of any association of the cancers in your family to what you’re saying and at your age.

AskDocs,"The real question here is what is your fathers (and your) goals of care in this situation? Being at 84 years old, the probability of him having no side effects and being able to live comfortable is minimal. Immunotherapy is a great treatment that is much more advanced now versus 2 years and will be even more advanced in the future. But, this again leads to my first question what are your goals of care? If this were my father, and knowing that he lived a great life I would hate to see him go through any suffering in the last months of his life. I would consider palliative care or hospice at this point.  This is a very sad situation but If I’m being Honest ... aggressive systematic therapy (even with immunotherapy relatively clean) at his age and comorbidities  is not something I would recommend. I wish you and your father the best in this unfortunate situation."
AskDocs,Go get a CT. Any time an our elderly population falls and bangs their head on the ground it warrants a scan now and a scan in the future if symptoms present. Subdural bleeds are common.
AskDocs,"They are maybe stating this because the internal carotid artery is roughly 2.5 cm away from your tonsils, therefore a tonsillectomy needs to be looked at thoroughly. Otherwise, this finding is quite common. I am not an ENT, so hopefully one could weigh on here. Good luck"
AskDocs,Tay tulla can cause it..what have you tried for meds? A prednisone pack would likely work wonders. Good luck
AskDocs,"On your menses, experiencing this symptoms - likely anemia from iron deficiency again. See your doctor."
AskDocs,"Go to the ER. If this is the worst she has had in years, then this requires some type of imaging and advanced care. Good luck"
AskDocs,How long have you been on the Kariva? I would suggest holding the birth control and following up with your PCP.
AskDocs,"May need IV antibiotics, even though no fever is a good sign. also may need to check for kidney stone with your current symptoms. Further evaluation would be a good idea."
AskDocs,"Any young family history of COPD? Unless you have a rare genetic disease like alpha1 at deficiency, there is about a 0% chance you have copd. Asthma or allergies Is much more likely"
AskDocs,"Remember prior to traveling to always find areas of which you are going and that are able to provide medical care. You likely have something going on with your cranial nerve eight. we can’t give you a “ this is exactly when you should worry about dizziness”……Everyone is different. You are in an unfortunate situation.  But if your symptoms are worsening, I suggest you seek care,"
AskDocs,"Doesn’t have to be 100% hepatitis or perhaps the assay that they are using is testing only for HbsAg or anti-Hbs and your niece is in the window period of which both are negative. With her symptoms, she needs to be tested for further than just hepatitis B. She could have hepatitis A.. She should also have *antimitochondrial antibodies sent for evaluation. I don’t have access to her lab work, but she should also be tested for hemolytic conditions. if she is very sick, she needs to go to an academic center and get a full work up done. Good luck."
AskDocs,"See PCP. Get a CXR, EKG and a transthoracic echocardiogram. This is not a heart attack, but does require a further workup."
AskDocs,"Any vision problems?
 Perhaps chronic reactive arthritis in the potential setting of a positive HLA b27 
See your primary care physician"
AskDocs,Sleep. Eat good. And stay hydrated.
AskDocs,"If you have a physician that treats lab values vs clinical presentations in asymptomatic, healthy individuals - find a new doc :)… 

Aka no."
AskDocs,"17 yo. 6 feet 1 inch, 130lbs. BMI 17.15
Chest pain x1 yr
Around a 0% probability of a heart attack
Any notable family history?
Likely anxiety related. But also you are tall and very skinny. That’s why I ask about your family history. Are you having any trouble breathing? 
I would see your primary care doctor and get some blood work, Chest X ray and EKG to assess your issue. 

Good luck. Eat young man!"
AskDocs,"Laprascopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis and surgical tx reduces pain. 

What happens to female hormones after menopause is found all over the Internet. 

Aka instead of searching for descriptive physiology not likely to be understood by bystanders - follow your pcp and specialist recommendations."
AskDocs,Please go to the ER if you are suffering and have this thought.
AskDocs,"Despite your self-diagnosis, these do sound like migraine or anxiety related tension headaches. You have identified clear triggers. Stay away from these and undergo further workup by seeing your primary care physician. Headaches are a difficult diagnosis to pinpoint, and cannot be done through the Internet. Do I think you have a brain tumor? No. Get some sleep and don’t use too many weight lifting supplements. Good luck"
AskDocs,"It sounds like you had a panic attack when you smoked marijuana.  Now you are having symptoms of anxiety, I would suggest seeing your primary care physician And staying away from drugs."
AskDocs,No
AskDocs,Would need photo to aid in diagnosis. very well could be or other diagnoses.
AskDocs,If ur worried get plan B.
AskDocs,Last photo shows this is in two definite separate spots which would make shingles unlikely.
AskDocs,"This sounds like IBS. I suspect your colonoscopy will be negative. 
The fact that you were able to recognize that the ‘pulsation in your abdomen is at the rhythm of your heart’ shows me that you have an anxiety component here. Relax, see the G.I. physician and get reassurance. Just because someone in your family has a disorder, does not mean that you well. I hope that this post will not make you anxious."
AskDocs,"This is a very difficult diagnosis to make, and I hope that these physicians at whatever destination you are at are able to stabilize this patient. You keep stating hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which is very rare. His symptoms do point towards something like myelofibrosis, Hodgkin disease, endocarditis, schnitzler syndrome, adult still disease and leukemia or maybe even TB. No physician on this set Bro will be able to give you a definitive diagnosis as this is extremely complex. But we can all wish you and your friend the absolute best. Good luck"
AskDocs,GI can manage it. It’ll be one of the first things they think of I’m sure :)
AskDocs,"Definitely sounds autoimmune.  PBC or even PSC with your hx of colitis fits your symptoms well. This should not be a mystery diagnosis, any female within your age group with unknown itchy skin (due to increased bile acids),  fatigue and joint pain with predominantly elevated ALP should have anti mitochondrial antibodies checked after ruling out the common ones. This involves your intrahepatic ducts, so unfortunately removing your gallbladder isn’t gonna do much. Good luck!"
AskDocs,"Exactly as you stated — anemia can cause fatigue, which can be caused by iron deficiency. Take one iron tablet daily. Get a CBC, and if severe see a hematologist for IV Iron. Good luck"
AskDocs,Try an OTC intranasal glucocorticoid like Flonase.
AskDocs,"Why did you do that? That’s an excessive amount of Tylenol. I hope this was not a suicide attempt. Regardless you’re likely in Stage III of acetaminophen OD Which is where everything can start to fail. 

You need to go to the ER and tell them exactly what you have told us here. At this point, we can initiate a 72 hour oral protocol. But if you present beyond with acute liver failure, all we can do at that point is put you on the list for a liver transplant.

Go to the ER. Don’t care what you say your symptoms are. If you did take this much, You have over 40% chance your liver is going to fail and when the liver fails, multi organ failure ensues which usually leads to death.

Go."
AskDocs,"Does not appear so. Where are you getting that these symptoms are definitively of Lyme disease? These are pretty nonspecific, unrelated symptoms, that could be due to a extremely wide range of diagnoses. I would trust the specialist and your primary care physician that you are currently under the care of."
AskDocs,"First off, let me say that having a friend, family member or anyone that you know going through something like this is always unimaginably hard. A patient with stage 4 colon cancer has a very tough road ahead of them.  Even with major advances in chemotherapy in the past years, fewer than 20% of those treated with chemotherapy are still alive at five years unless surgery can potential provide a curative option with limited metastatic disease. This is something we cannot predict, as every patient is different. If she is sitting in the hospital with a nasty pneumonia it is very difficult to give you any prediction on what could happen; but in her immunocompromised state from her previous cancer treatments it will make it harder to fight off a serious infection.  Is it possible? Yes, I’ve seen it multiple times before. But I’ve also seen it go the opposite way. At this time I would encourage you to show that you are there and supporting. This will help her in this difficult fight. Stay strong, and I wish your friend the best of luck."
AskDocs,"As said above, tardive dyskinesia does not happen after one dose. If the symptoms do happen again, take a Benadryl and you’ll feel better. Good luck!"
AskDocs,"OK sorry I did not mean to come off as rude if taken it that way.  He suffered any neurological damage during this overdose, and is experiencing some odd symptoms then I would definitely recommend seeing a neurologist as you have stated - this is a good step."
AskDocs, Could have passed a kidney stone. Stay hydrated
AskDocs,"Are you still vomiting? Aggressive vomiting can cause little tears in our esophagus called Mallory Weiss tears,  Which are self-limiting and are able to most of the time heal by them selves.  However, there is a more serious disorder called Boorhaaves syndrome where it is more than just a little tear. This is associated with a thing we call subcutaneous emphysema with severe chest, neck or upper abdominal pain. I would encourage you to read about these disorders, and if they do fit your presentation then proceed to an urgent care or ER. Thank you for your case. Good luck

Ps you don’t need to keep your vomit. We will collect our own gastric secretions, or trust you when we see your lab/radiographic results if something was going on. Don’t worry"
AskDocs,So CPR because his stomach was blue? Remember to always check a pulse first. I can’t tell you if he has permanent damage without knowing the time he was “down” aka the duration of time his brain was deprived of oxygen. Even with this value I would be giving you an opinion and guessing. I can tell you It’s not the sedative meds .  Give it some time. Good luck
AskDocs,"First, yes if these symptoms are debilitating, lasting for 4 day and non amenable to medications - go to ER. 

But looking at the whole picture here - the fact you are able to post on Redditt and are not toxic, lethargic, in a coma after 4 days of symptoms —-That is a good sign that this is likely not meningitis. Stiff neck doesn’t always mean meningitis...but we can get caught up on this. Meningitis patients are SICK and the fact you are able to type on a computer your symptoms and answer questions appropriately - i would suspect this deadly disease is not the case. 

Regardless, if these are your symptoms - an ER visit would be warranted to get a CT scan and rule out other causes. 

Keep us updated. Good luck."
AskDocs,Too young man. Relax.
AskDocs,"Wide differential. I would go see a rheumatologist, yes."
AskDocs,You sound what we call “asymptomatic”……if you’re not pregnant I wouldn’t see the need for an antibiotic.
AskDocs,No
AskDocs,"Hello. I am very sorry to hear about this unfortunate situation. This is something that I never wish upon people to go through, but this is a very common thing that I see in the hospital. Your father has had a hemorrhagic stroke, and is likely a poor candidate for any surgical intervention due to his underlying comorbidities which include Parkinson’s as he stated (of which I do not know the severity of, nor other past medical history).  There are many factors that go into surgical evaluation for hemorrhagic evacuation, and every neurosurgeon is different. If this is a neurosurgeon that is board-certified, he has gone through extensive training longer than most, if not all, residency programs. I would trust his judgment, if your father is still alert and awake at this time (despite some sedation, which is likely due to delirium/agitation overnight, which I also see often) The risks of the surgery likely outweigh any benefits that could come from this. It is difficult to evacuate hemorrhaging from the brain without complications, especially in our elderly population. I am not going to get into the factors that go into choosing a patient for surgery, as I am not a surgeon, I just want to give you a little input on what might actually be occurring. I wish you and your family the best of luck during this difficult time. And if you feel the need to get a second opinion, then that is your right. But remember neurosurgeons are some of the most highly trained physicians in the world, and they usually know what’s best for their patients. Prayers are you with and your family."
AskDocs,Sounds like a pilonidal cyst. If it’s open and draining you should make sure it is thoroughly cleaned. If you notice increased redness and foul smelling drainage - you likely need antibiotics so therefore see a physician.
AskDocs,Any unprotected sex?
AskDocs,"Could get septic, I can’t really tell the depth in the photo, but if it’s deep I would suggest seeking care."
