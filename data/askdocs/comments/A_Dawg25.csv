AskDocs,"Sorry for your loss. 

When you state it's been a few years since their last ECHO, keep in mind somethings can change within a few years, especially depending when the last one was done. But considering the LVH, I assume she probably had a history of hypertension (HTN) which can easily cause LVH as it puts strain on the ventricles of the heart due to them having to work harder against the increased pressure from HTN. 

Additionally, with her history of having a stroke, did she perhaps have a history of high cholesterol / hyperlipidemia (HLD) as well? Because overtime, especially with a history of HTN and HLD, as this can cause the vessels or arteries in the body to stiffen or become harder leading to atherosclerosis, which increases the risk of having both a stroke and heart disease.  

Otherwise, I'm again sorry for your loss and hope this helps some."

AskDocs,"Just the ways our bodies are built i think.

Hence, some people have an easier time pooping if they lean slightly more forward as I’ve read it helps relax or open up the colorectal area a bit more to allow for a smoother defecation process. 

Otherwise, if you just pooped yesterday and assuming there was no blood or anything else frankly abnormal about it, especially on top of passing gas I’d doubt you have a perf’d bowel."
AskDocs,"When did you last poop and are you passing gas at all? Any nausea, vomiting, etc? 

Otherwise, unless you have a significant history of GI problems like IBD, ulcerative colitis, gallbladder to liver problems, diverticulitis, or bowel obstructions i wouldn’t prioritize a perf’d bowel, especially if it’s your normal to not poop for a day or two sometimes.

personalfinance,"Thank you, I didn’t consider that!

I didn’t mention my base pay but I usually take home around $1,300 every two weeks with a gross of around $2,100 as about $300 goes to a Roth every two weeks. 

I was assuming getting the additional bonus checks on the next check while will be more but I was thinking more be taxed or withheld like you said due to putting me in a different tax bracket for that pay period? Or does that tax bracket only apply for what you make at the end of the year?"
personalfinance,"Thanks I spoke to them. 

They didn’t submit it on the form. So it’ll show up on my next paycheck which frustrates me a little, especially as I specifically told them to make sure it got done. Even more so as I think it’ll be taxed a bit more due to more overtime and additional bonus shifts that I’ve picked up for the next pay period."
personalfinance,"I guess that makes sense in terms allowing me to take home what I should expect but the part that just frustrates me is where the “bonus” shift is suppose to be. 

I’ll talk to my manager in the morning but when this has happened in the past they apply it to my next check which I feel like is taxed even more. Could perhaps this be the case you think? Perhaps to slightly make up for the difference if they apply the bonus payment to the next check?"
personalfinance,"I’m pretty positive I did as ours usually is a pay period behind.

So with this check, it would have been from 11-23 to 12-6. The bonus shift I picked up for was on 12-5 where I usually only work 60 hours a pay period but since I was picked an extra shift I worked 72 which this check had 72 hours on it with about 8 hours of overtime as the week of 12-5 I worked four 12 hour shifts."

If it’s for health related questions, we can help but if it’s related to school purposes you need to ask in another subreddit like r/nursingstudent if your a nursing student.

AskDocs,"Agreed with what they stated above.

If you could find out what they hemoglobin & hematocrit was, this could help us give you better insight."
AskDocs,"I’m sorry for your loss.

Bare with me as neurology isn’t much of my specialty but what I recall from school and have seen in practice, for your question, its rare but cerebral edema can happen after ischemic strokes. Obviously when this occurs due to a stroke, especially as tissues die it can cause some of the intracellular components of the cells / tissue to leak into surrounding tissues causing swelling, which the brain can’t tolerate very well, especially due to being an enclosed space with limited capacity to swell. 

Also, your terminology is correct! As you described it sounds like they tried to do surgery or decompress the cranial cavity, as again that area can’t tolerate very much swelling or brain stem herniation can occur, which can be fatal. Obviously before it gets to this point, unless it’s very severe and if surgery was an option i assume it was pretty bad as you described, but sometimes doctors can treat it with medications like with oxygen / hyperventilating, diuretics, and or steroids to prevent the swelling from worsening.

Again, I’m sorry for you and your families loss."
AskDocs,"Confusion can be common after any type of procedure that involves general anesthesia with a invasive cardiac procedure, especially in those of advanced age with multifactorial comorbidities but to clarify it’s not normal but can be common. 

On that note, whether if he improves from it or not depends on what’s causing the confusion. You mention a history of memory issues which is very common in our older population, depending on what caused that could be contributing? Hence, did he have a stroke in the past? But at his age there is most likely a laundry list of problems on top of having the TAVR performed that could be contributing to it ranging from his medications, infection, or other postoperative complications. Then again, like our verified user  stated above, being in unfamiliar environments can easily contribute to this as well. 

Otherwise, keep getting updates from the staff and or have the provider give you or your family a phone call to answer some of your other questions."

Otherwise, I think treatment is going to depend on the underlying cause. So, definitely follow up."
AskDocs,"It's never a good idea to lie to your doctor. 

Depending on the side effects you've experienced, there are various other types of medications as well but other than medications, have you talked to your provider about various different types of cognitive behavioral therapies?"
AskDocs,"You’ve got some legit concerns. Out of curiosity, what does your BP generally run and do you smoke, and or take any other medications? 

First of all, and someone correct me if I’m wrong here but the CPK while elevated, is kind of non-specific for generalized muscle damage. So, this can be caused from over exertion with exercise, rhabdo,or other muscular related disorders. On that note, the troponin was normal, which is VERY specific to cardiac damage and if you had a heart attack or some type of other type 2 / secondary cardiac damage that value would most likely be elevated. 

For the lipid panel. While the cholesterol and LDL levels are elevated, they aren’t too significantly high YET, but now should be a time to start turning them around because if it’s ignored it can lead to significant cardiac problems like atherosclerosis, strokes, or heart attacks later in your life. So, work with your provider on trying to get those under control whether with diet and or medication therapy.

As for the elevated HS-CRP, bare with me as I’m not 100% familiar with it at least compared to a CRP but generally an elevated CRP it indicates some type of inflammation somewhere in the body, with the HS I assume being of a higher sensitivity to help your provider determine a better treatment for you. So, with you having a history of HTN and with some elevations in your cholesterol, I would expect some elevations in that lab result, but you would still need to follow up with your provider on this, especially as one time readings may need to be repeated."
KansasCityChiefs,And hire and refire Dee Ford for being offsides
AskDocs,"I’d expect a little fatigue after a heart cath, especially depending on the severity of his blockages that required stents / interventions but if he can hardly keep his eyes open with conversation something could be off but considering I’m not part of his care plan or know the full clinical picture I can’t say for sure. 

Otherwise, if you or your family is concerned you should notify his provider as one is usually on call. From my perspective it be good to know what medications they sent him home on and or if you know it a recent blood pressure / HR or blood sugar is always helpful to know as well, especially as a lot of those medications post heart cath can cause some drowsiness or lightheadedness to some extent. Also, how his surgical cath site looks. Hence make sure it’s not worsening in swelling, increasing in pain, or that his site is feeling looking colder / paler, etc."

AskDocs,"Tried a different finger? Also make sure your hands aren’t cold, nails covered in something, etc.

Of course if you leave it on your finger long enough you’ll usually see something but if it feels like palpitations or like a “skipped beat” it could be something like PVC’s as they don’t always register on those sensors. Hence, showing HR’s in the 30-40’s for a brief second that come right back up usually.

Otherwise, never hurts to talk to your doctor about it but personally I wouldn’t rush over it unless I started developing symptoms like what I said above, let alone shortness of breath, feeling lightheaded, chest pain, etc."
AskDocs,"It’s a possibility. But how well are you urinating? Did they obtain a urine sample as well to check for anything else as well?

Because normally there is a little bit of pericardial fluid in the sacs the surround the heart, when it over accumulates that's when it becomes a problem.

AskDocs,"A heart rate of 55 is barely bradycardic. 

Besides, as people lose weight and become more physically fit yea heart rate can decrease but again it takes a long time. More importantly, even tho heart rate can but keep in mind it doesn’t always decrease as you become more physically fit, your heart doesn’t have to work as hard as it actually pumps stronger and more blood more effectively to the rest of your body. Hence, why very fit people have low resting HR’s despite not feeling symptomatic. Also, we don’t usually get concerned unless patients start becoming symptomatic with bradycardia such as with them feeling dizzy, lightheaded, short of breath, etc.

Again tho, the risks of being overweight and or not getting your sleep apnea treated / managed properly outweigh the benefits any day as it can lead to laundry lists health problems down the road."
AskDocs,"Have you been tested for sleep apnea?

Untreated sleep apnea easily causes bradycardia and if it’s not treated and or managed, especially on top of your managing a proper diet with exercise it can significantly increase your chance of cardiovascular problems later in life.

Otherwise, as you lose weight and become more physically fit yea heart rate can start to eventually decrease as you increase cardiac output with better vagal tone but this takes sometime. Also, risk of being overweight and leading an unhealthy lifestyle with untreated sleep apnea comes with greater risks."

AskDocs,"Other than going to the ER as they is severely low (typo with 9x10^9?) making you at a VERY high risk for bleeding. Do you follow a hematologist still? If not, probably be a really good idea to because if your platelet count is really that low, you need some type of treatment very soon as your at very high risk for bleeding obviously. 

But out of curiosity were you born with any type of autoimmune disorder, viral, or other problems with the liver or bone marrow? If unsure that’s okay as sometimes doctors don’t know what causes ITP as well! Because to my knowledge and someone correct me if I’m wrong but I haven’t heard of prednisone causing liver problems as it suppresss the immune system to allow the some parts of the body to recover by reducing inflammation and in some instances increase platelet counts, especially if bone marrow is effected. 

Otherwise, treatment I think usually depends on the situation with ITP. For instance, yes steroids can be given and yes weight gain is a side effect of them due to water / sodium / fat retention. On the other hand, IV medications like with platelet or immunoglobulin transfusions can be given as well."
AskDocs,"Obviously not a cardiologist but looking at this from my phone, its pretty difficult to measure the qt interval, let alone a qtc. Hence, a 12 lead be more suitable.

Looking at your post history, it appears you’ve had a pretty good cardiac workup with I assume the 30 day holter monitor still ongoing? If so, you may need to wait for that. If it’s already completed what did it show? Additionally, did your sleep study that you mentioned in a previous post show anything either? Because if you have sleep apnea that can contribute to palpitations very easily. 

Otherwise knowing other info such as what triggers these palpitations and what makes them worse / better, including how your diet or if any bloodwork was done is always good information to know as well."

Usually my floor wouldn’t even have patients like this, but due to covid both our hospitals and especially ICU are starting to get at max capacity.

Unfortunately, I can’t say 100% sure but usually after a cardiac cath we recommend to patients that they avoid strenuous activities for at least a week, so I’m sure that didn’t help. Also, I’m not sure what they prescribed him but some of the typical postoperative medications they prescribe after a heart cath are to prevent those stents from getting clogged back up, and unfortunately if they do clog back such as from not taking the medication then it can lead to another heart attack.

AskDocs,"Bare with me as strokes aren't really my specialty but to my knowledge and someone please correct me if I'm wrong...

But usually CT scans are really good for identifying hemorrhagic strokes as for ischemic strokes sometimes it can be a little more difficult, especially as there are various factors to consider like the time, location, and severity (size) of the stroke / occlusion that may or may not always appear on a CT head without contrast. For instance, CT head scans without contrast may sometimes have poor sensitivity for picking up on early changes of ischemic changes usually within 6-8 hours, unless the area of infarct (lack of blood supply) is pretty large or has gone on for awhile. Also, to my knowledge, the cerebellum and other smaller structures of the brain are usually pretty difficult area to visualize on CT scans, at least compared to an MRI which covers a lot more detail.  

Otherwise, it's really hard to pinpoint some exacts but the severe headaches and nausea would definitely concern me. Do you have any way to monitor your BP at home, especially considering your now taking an antihypertensive? Obviously if it's really high or if you have vision changes again, especially while it's high like 180/90+, then another E.R. trip should be necessary.

Hence, sinus arrhythmia is usually normal in young healthy people, as it's part of the bodies normal physiological methods to balance acid-bases, etc. So, as you breath in you increase the pressure in your chest due to more blood flow return to the heart, making the heart have to pump more blood out, ultimately increasing the rate a bit.

The main reason being is because these medications are processed / metabolized by the kidneys and some adverse effects have been reported that especially considering how this medication works is that it can alter your electrolytes, especially your potassium making it too high which can be very dangerous. Also, considering that this medication is processed by the kidneys, this can increase the risk of causing an acute kidney injury, especially if you are dehydrated while on this medication.

In healthcare pneumonia is something we take very seriously. Like, OP said while to some this may not seem like a big deal, it’s a serious issue because it can lead down a road to other major health issues that some may not even consider, especially in our elderly or those who are already sick populations that take longer to recover. For instance, to just name a few: Sepsis, respiratory failure, ARDS, fluid overload, even death! 

Otherwise, OP I’m glad your father was able to make a recovery and for those who haven’t my condolences."
AskDocs,"Could you call the staff for updates?

It’s too hard to say without assessing her and knowing her full medical history in person but with the history of high cholesterol, her age, and I possibly assume some history of high blood pressure, that would easily increase her risk of a stroke.

Otherwise, I’m sure the staff will be performing frequent neurological checks on her and if the symptoms persist, let alone worsen, further testing could always be warranted.

Otherwise, following up and making sure you are adequately hydrated like your provider recommended is necessary because if you were dehydrated while these labs were obtained it could easily reflect it based on those labs."
AskDocs,"As long as you don’t have any other markers such as protein in your urine or some other diagnosed related kidney disorder that could indicate kidney disease, an eGFR above 60 is typically considered normal.

Otherwise, a common question that we always ask in healthcare is what’s the plan, how are they doing, etc, especially as they are very open ended questions that should hopefully carry on a conversation that can result in essential information. 

Also to some of your questions, if the fluid is in her lungs and I assume the extremities are swollen, especially due to heart failure, the diuretics should hopefully pull some of that fluid out via urination. So, how much is she urinating is a VERY VERY important question to ask as well and if she isn’t urinating, asking what are the next steps is always okay to ask as well. 

Also knowing the weight is very essential as well, because it’s an extremely good indicator along with her urinary output at how much she could be potentially retaining, that could ultimately put excess strain on the heart.

Otherwise, I don’t think it’s 100% understood why but some studies I’ve read indicate that lowering the body temperature slows the bodies basic metabolic rate to allow it more time to recover, while reducing the chance of inflammation and swelling around the brain.

But to cover some bases, have you taken any antacids or calcium / dietary like supplements? Because while the calcium and ionized calcium (assuming thats measured in mmol) do appear mildly to moderately elevated, sometimes it can provoke kidney problems.

However, if it's dropping significant amounts, especially while standing it sounds like orthostatic hypotension, which can be caused by a variety of things. 

So, unless you can get followed up anytime soon, definitely take your time standing up and be sure to keep drinking plenty of fluids to stay adequately hydrated."

AskDocs,"When did you last donate blood? Are your menstrual cycles normal or pretty heavy? Do you drink plenty of fluids? Also, any recent lab work? However, more importantly, if this is still going on, you should be evaluated.

Otherwise, hypovolemic shock cant be determined over a public forum. So, unless your losing blood, stop the bleed, or if your dehydrated, get some fluids in! However, on that note, some numbers are always beneficial here.

Hence, some bloodwork like a BUN, creatinine, hemoglobin with hematocrit and vital signs with blood pressure and heart rate would be key indicators whether or not your actually hypovolemic. 

Otherwise, it could be a range of things from your  BPPV, orthostatic hypotension, anemia, to even possibly hypovolemia based on your vital signs."

AskDocs,"> Now, I'm well aware that quitting smoking is generally accepted as being good for your cardiovascular system, however, I'm concerned that in my dad's case it may have caused more harm than good.

Yea, no. 

Personally, I've never heard of cardiovascular related events due to Chantix but honestly, if anything the lifetime of smoking is probably catching up to him. Also, if he's being fitted for a life vest, its most likely he has a pretty low ejection fraction (EF) which puts him at further risk for sudden cardiac death, especially on top of the smoking. 

On that note, what medications did they send him home on? Also, other than working very closely with his primary care team and cardiologist, I'd ask one of them about some type of cardiac rehab if possible, as exercise is important for maintaining cardiovascular health and needs to be carefully monitored in those with heart problems. 

Furthermore, obviously make sure that he completely stops smoking, and generally speaking, we recommend to our cardiac patients no more than 1,500mg of sodium per day."

Otherwise, I’d HIGHLY encourage her to go to the ER as well and go from there. If possible, call ahead in advance to see if they can be prepped for her as she may be immunocompromised with labs like that as well."
AskDocs,"Great advice here! 

Also, if I may add to this. Generally speaking, I prefer the least invasive to most invasive approach as well. So, see how they do on the BiPAP before intubation becomes an option, ultimately hoping that it doesn't. Hence, if they're breathing and oxygen levels get worse, or simply do not respond to various clinical interventions, then other options may be brought to the table."

Also, elevated eosinophil counts, let alone slightly elevated ones I haven't seen associated with leukemia, and if I had to guess, I'm sure could be contributed to the asthma. However, if it's still a significant concern, including some more lab specifics, may always be helpful. So, including a full CBC with a differential and coagulation studies might be beneficial such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, bands, PT / INR, etc. 

Otherwise, do you see a specialist such as a pulmonologist and if so, what have they said?"
AskDocs,"Sorry for you and your families loss.

However, don’t you think someone would’ve noticed something, such as her still breathing if she was? Also, while I don’t know your entire countries culture, rules, and regulations I can’t see a medical professional lying about someone passing, as that would be extremely unethical and unprofessional. Furthermore, various policies are in place at least where I live that must be followed before the announcement of death must be called, such as verifying heart sounds, pulse, pupillary response, etc, especially with a second nurse for at least an entire minute in each area.

Also, as for the cotton soaked in blood, perhaps it was as a result from the embalming process? For instance, the body is obviously drained of various fluids within multiple organs after death and without getting into too much details. But by putting cotton into orifices, that can prevent that fluid and other bacteria, germs, etc from seeping out by obviously absorbing the fluid."

Otherwise, did he black out? Any other symptoms? For instance, nausea, confusion, lightheaded, headache, weakness? Obviously, and i get the spouses concern especially during the pandemic but if any of these symptoms develop I’d encourage them to call.

They are not just the guys who washes sheets and helps them remove various infections from occurring in the hospital. They’re even some of the best people you can both work with and meet! 

For instance, our EVS department is so friendly with all of our patients while their cleaning rooms. Their simple conversations, let alone presence brightens the day of many patients whose family has either been forced during this quarantine to not visit them, let alone those that don’t want to see them anymore regardless, which can be so heartbreaking. Also, I wish I could learn to fold towels the way a lot of our EVS workers can into various shapes or animals, as I find that so talented and cool, especially as it’s a good distraction for our confused patients. 

Lastly, I do my best to look out for them as much as they do for me. So, whether it’s simply mopping a floor, to helping them make a bed for a new admit coming, I hope makes the biggest difference for them, as I know they are just as busy as I am sometimes, especially with them being essential eyes and ears of our hospital. For instances, sometimes they can keep me informed on issues that may be occurring on other floors that might affect us. To simply having a new set of eyes on my patient while they’re simply talking to them to / cleaning a room, can make the biggest difference for a patients clinical outcome, especially as anything can change within a moments notice with time being of crucial essence in most medical situations."

Otherwise, I doubt any ER would refuse care but based on the specifics above or till then, is there a primary to call to help with this first? As for going with, can’t say as it’s varies on hospital policies.

Otherwise, and bare with me as I’m not quite familiar with the ins and outs of MCV, RDW, and MCH, as usually these are more up to our docs or specialists.

Now pile this on top of the multiple comorbidites or other health problems like the pneumonia, heart attacks, let alone other medical problems that follow suit with these medical conditions, including other past medical issues we don’t already know about, can obviously create a lot of problems.

Because, unless you have active or visible lesions, then I don’t really understand why HSV would be tested for to begin with, especially as I’ve read routine screenings for HSV-2 especially without lesions present can create false positives. However, if possible, you can clarify with your birth mother as well, to make sure they didn’t have it present during your birth, because if it was, then HSV-2 can spread that way too.

Also, and not to ignore your concern but don’t freak out too much about HSV-1, especially as about 3.6 billion people on the world have come in contact with it at some point. Additionally, there’s various medications out there to suppress the virus as well and to prevent transmission of it."

AskDocs,"Sounds like a seizure to me but it's always hard to say, especially since we didn't witness it. 

But depending where the seizure occurred, breaking bones and biting one's tongue can easily happen during an epileptic seizure. For instance, if they are convulsing and fell prior to this happening as well, those two situations could easily happen. Furthermore, excessive drinking of alcohol easily increases the risk of seizures as well, especially as alcohol is not just considered a toxin to the body, but also because it depletes the body of various electrolytes and minerals like potassium, magnesium, thiamine, etc., that the body needs in order to function. Additionally, when individuals may cease alcohol consumption, especially if their bodies have become dependent on it after a period of time, the risk of having seizures increases even more as well.  

On that note, the confusion makes me believe, he may have even experienced a post-tictal to lucid state that occurs after seizures happens. For instance, during the post-tictal phase, while people are generally confused, they typically get better within a few hours till they progress to a normal lucid interval, which may take a few days to around a week or so to completely recover, depending on the extent of the seizure.

Absolutely not. 

Generally speaking, some meds like corticosteroids can typically cause blood sugar levels to raise but since this wasn’t included I won’t assume that’s part of the case. Also, remember it’s all about moderation and while he may feel fine, I wouldn’t be shocked if his organs are already taking a hit from the various nutritional and electrolyte deficiencies that can come with blood sugar levels that high.

However, if they haven’t now be a good time to work on healthier habits because at the end of the day I’m sure the last thing any of you want and while I’m not trying to ensure fear but if this results in diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA it generally comes with a lot more problems including high mortality rates."
AskDocs,"Bare with me here as OB isn't really my expertise but how long have you had this fever for? Did you deliver cesarean or vaginally? Breastfeeding? Any other symptoms, problems urinating, etc? 

But to answer your question, you go from shivering to sweating because it's all part of your bodies regulatory processes to help get rid of the fever and whatever could be causing it. So, when you have a fever, your body typically vasoconstricts the blood flow to the extremities making you feel really cold causing shivering to covering yourself up in blankets to help bring the body temperature up. 

At that point, once your temperature reaches that certain threshold you start the cooling process and obviously throw off the blankets because your burning up, take some kind of antipyretic like Ibuprofen or Tylenol which helps break the fever as it's believed these medications reduce inflammation.

Otherwise, I'd probably get this checked out."

As for your questions, white blood cells in the urine don’t always mean UTI or kidney infection. Furthermore, you’d typically have other evidence supporting a UTI or kidney infection such as nitrites in the urine, increased WBC count on your blood test, including the culture from your urine growing some type of bacteria, let alone various other typical symptoms.

Otherwise, your creatinine is barely elevated and probably need to drink a bit more water. Also, keep in mind eGFR is only an estimate of your kidney function while GFR is the true indicator. So, while your eGFR is suppose to be above 90 for most people, in a lot of instances it’s okay for some people to be between 60-89.
