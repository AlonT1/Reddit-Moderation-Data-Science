/u/blubuny is correct, by forcing water into your vagina you most likely upset the pH balance leading to a yeast infection.

relationship_advice,"I had a very similar situation with my best friend. We met in college and became fast friends. We became very close and even close with each other's families. He was even the best man at my wedding back in 2013. Then Trump became president and it all started to go down hill. The liberal, cool and fun best friend I had known the last 12 years was slowly changing before my eyes. After college our lives diverged. He went to law school and I went to medical school. Over the years apart we kept in close contact, but I guess the distance and him hanging out with other people had an impact. After Law school he moved back in with his parents, who are pretty conservative. His father was laid off close to his retirement and was resentful ever since. I guess him living at home with his parents, where Fox News is on all day started to have an effect on him. After Trump became president he slowly morphed into a far right conservative. He would call me and make comments about immigrants and the ""takers"" in society. How he ended up getting the short end of the stick because he is white. Mind you, my parents are immigrants, my wife is an immigrant, but he continued to act as if I agreed with everything he said. Eventually I had to just end the relationship. He became toxic, blaming everyone and everything but himself for his life issues. It was painful and I think about him all the time. Losing a best friend is tough."

AskDocs,Your doctor should act as your advocate. Tell her exactly what you want and why you want it. Also express to her that you want it all kept confidential. There is no reason for her to violate your trust or confidentiality.
AskDocs,"The short answer is no, your doctor should not go and tell your parents anything without your consent. You can tell your doctor that you don't want anyone to know and they should respect that. Now, I have seen situations where the doctor is a relative or family friend and they break confidentiality, but it is against the rules of being a physician. Your doctor should only disclose information to your parents after specifically asking you if its ok."
AskDocs,"Hi OP, 

So this one is a little tricky, but very very common. Many young adults who are still minors seek contraception, or sexual education from their physician with the hope that their parents don't find out. I've seen it many times. 

There are a few things to be aware of when it comes to doctor patient confidentiality of minors. Physicians have a responsibility to protect the confidentiality of minor patients, within certain limits. In some states, the law permits minors who are not emancipated to request and receive confidential services relating to contraception, or to pregnancy testing, prenatal care, and delivery services. Similarly, states may permit unemancipated minors to request and receive confidential care to prevent, diagnose, or treat sexually transmitted disease, substance use disorders, or mental illness. So you'll have to investigate what your local laws state. 

Most doctors will keep everything confidential, so long as the patient has appropriate decision-making capacity in the specific circumstances and the physician believes the decision is in the patientâ€™s best interest. Meaning, as long as your doctor thinks you are making good decisions for yourself you should be able to get what you need. One thing to remember however, just because your doctor doesn't say anything to your parents doesn't mean they can't find out from other sources. Since you are a minor its possible fo ryour parents to learn about the request for treatment or testing through other means, like  insurance statements for example. 

I hope this is helpful. Check your local laws about medical treatment and confidentiality for minors, and then go see your doctor."
AskDocs,"Hi OP, 

Could you post a picture? There are a few reasons men going through puberty might develop breasts. Shape and size can sometimes help shed light on the cause. Gynecomastia, could be the cause, as its the most common reason for pubescent males to develop breasts.  This is a mostly harmless condition, with the only real issue being cosmetic. It can sometimes resolve on its own, but you should see a doctor to get your hormone levels checked."

As far as your complaint about your vision, you probably need glasses. Make an appointment to see an eye doctor and have them do a full exam."
AskDocs,"Hi OP, 

You are getting 8-10 hours of sleep per day, which is technically enough, or too much honestly. The double/ghost vision you describe could have something to do sleeping during the day and staying up all night, but I can't be for certain. Do you work some sort of night shift job, or is there some other reason you are doing this?"
AskDocs,"Hi OP, 

The image you posted isn't very clear so its hard to see what I'm actually looking at. Based on your description and the unhygienic conditions you were living in, there is a decent chance it could be an abscess.

AskDocs,"Hi OP,

I think I agree with your NP's diagnosis. This looks like ringworm to me, which is a fairly common fungal infection. You have a darker skin tone, which makes it more difficult to see, but the redness and itching make me feel more confident that's what it is. Do you tend to sweat a lot? I have seen ringworm on breasts before, but usually the infection is either under the breast, or between the breasts in the cleavage area.  You don't need to worry about cancer. This is not how breast cancer presents. Also, you are far too young. Unless you have significant family history, like a mother or sister with a diagnosis at a young age you don't need to worry. Use the cream as your NP instructed. In addition you can go to the pharmacy and get a bottle of antifungal shampoo, and make sure the active ingredient is some type of -azole. Then use that shampoo as a body wash. Apply the shampoo to the infected area BEFORE getting in the shower. Allow it to dry up a little before getting in the shower and washing it off. After you shower make sure you dry the infected area thoroughly before applying the Ketoconazole cream. 

One more thing to keep in mind about fungal infections is they are notoriously difficult to treat and get rid of. Be sure to follow the treatment regime for 2 - 3 weeks, or until the rash completely resolves. If after 3 weeks if the rash hasn't improved then I suggest getting a referral for a dermatologist. 

Good Luck."
AskDocs,"Hi OP,

I recommend telling her to go to the hospital or urgent care as others suggest. While it is possible to treat some burns at home this injury appears quite large and should be evaluated by a medical professional. This could get worse, and what you don't want is an infection."

AskDocs,"In a surgical context your would be correct. OBGYNs are also surgeons, but as you noted, they don't tend to do much surgery for breast. However, examination, diagnosis and non-surgical treatment of breast conditions usually fall to OBGYNs. Most women get their mammograms as a referral or service from their OBGYN. If surgical treatment of a breast condition is warranted then the OBGYN will refer their patient either to a general surgeon, or a specialized breast surgeon."

relationship_advice,"Hi OP, 

So I just wanted to offer you a medical perspective on this issue that you can bring up with your husband. TV and movies have made most people believe that breast augmentation surgery is no big deal, but in fact there are several risks and complications that can occur from the surgery itself. 

Just to list a few:

* Anesthesia risks
* Bleeding
* Hematoma
* Infection
* Changes in nipple or breast sensation
* Poor scarring
* Wrong or faulty position of the implant
* Implant leakage or rupture
* The formation of tight scar tissue around the implant (capsular contracture)
* Fluid accumulation (seroma)
* Wrinkling of the skin over the implant
* Persistent pain
* Possibility of revision surgery

All that can be a result of the surgery itself. There are also the long term effects of breast implants. Within two years of having breast implants inserted, women reported experiencing signs and symptoms of connective tissue disease such as increased muscle weakness, fatigue, and muscle and joint pain. Twenty percent of patients with breast augmentations required additional surgeries after only three years due to complications. The complications included infection, loss of breast sensation, hematoma, and development of scar tissue that sometimes resulted in misshapen breasts or pain.
Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified a possible association between breast implants and the development of breast-implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), an uncommon cancer of the immune system.

This is not a simple surgery. There are real consequences that can occur from this procedure. At the end of the day you have to weigh the risks and benefits, and at this point it seems the risks are far greater for you."

AskDocs,"Premature ejaculation can have several causes ranging from physical to mental. THC in marijuana increases the amount of serotonin in your brain. Ejaculation is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, the same system that controls fight or flight. Serotonin depresses the sympathetic nervous system, which can cause delayed ejaculation. This is very similar to the way SSRI antidepressants work. In fact many people use SSRIs as a form of treatment for premature ejaculation. 

There are several treatments available today. As I mentioned above, the use of SSRIs is an option as well as ointments or gels that can be applied to dull sensitivity. There are some more psychologically focused treatments as well. Research Masters & Johnson techniques for premature ejaculation. Also look up a technique called Sensate Focus. As always I also recommend talking to your doctor for additional treatment options or referrals. 

Good luck."

AskDocs,"I do agree with the others who have commented that this is most likely ringworm. Ringworn is a fungal infection of the skin or scalp, and as other has said it can be quite contagious, so try to avoid skin to skin contact with that area. 

Head down to your local pharmacy and pick up a bottle of anti-fungal shampoo. Ask the pharmacist if you are unsure of which brand to get. Now the thing with fungal infections is they can be very resiliant and take a while to get rid of. Make sure you use the shampoo daily for at least 2 weeks, or until the rash is gone. Let me know if you have any questions. You can get more information from the Mayo Clinic: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ringworm-scalp/symptoms-causes/syc-20354918 "

AskDocs,"Hi OP,

I wouldn't say your HDL is low. I would consider an HDL of 46 to be considered within normal range. While having a higher HDL is desirable, sometimes genetics can make it difficult. Lipid levels can be heavily influenced by genetics, as there are several types of familial dyslipidemias.  There are about 3 million new cases diagnosed every year. 

As far as raising your HDL goes, you seem to already be doing all the right things. However there is one thing you can do. Alcohol can increase HDL. One drink a day, wine or hard liquor, no beer. That's basically the only other thing you can do from my perspective."

So it's very likely that the bleeding is being caused by the Implanon. One of the biggest complaints from patients who use Implanon as a contraceptive complain of long heavy periods. I'm shocked that your OBGYN hasn't told you this and offered you an IUD like Mirena, which is what I would recommend. My suggestion would be to first find a new OBGYN. Then  make an appointment an ask them to remove the Implanon and replace it with a Mirena, or some form of Progesterone medicated IUD.  If all goes well the persistent bleeding should stop and she will only have a period a few times a year. The IUD is good for five years and can be removed anytime. Its the most popular form of contraception globally.

Good luck. Let me know if you have any questions."
AskDocs,No problem. Let me know if you have any questions.
creepyPMs,Tooms? Is that you?
AskDocs,"Good morning OP, 

Looks to me like you may have a ringworm or some other type of fungal infection. Head over to your local pharmacy and get an anti-fungal cream off the shelf. You can ask the pharmacist if you need help choosing which medicine. Apply the cream twice daily, once in the morning and once at night, after a shower if possible. Additionally, try your best to keep the area as dry as possible, as fungus likes to grown in damp dark places. Fungal infections can take some time to get rid of, so make sure you use the anti-fungal cream daily for at least 2 weeks, or until the rash has completely resolved. If for any reason it gets worse, then I would suggest seeing your doctor to get a stronger prescription medication. Hope this helps. "

Aside from that, it is recommended that skin not make direct contact with ice for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. Direct contact with ice, or something equally as cold on bare skin for more than 15 minutes can lead to frostbite. This is the typical rule of thumb used by athletes when icing muscle pains. "

relationship_advice,"I just thought I would offer my advice as a medical professional. I'm a family doctor by training, and  my wife is an OBGYN, in  NYC. I have a question, why can't she just get an IUD (intrauterine device)? They are safe, cost effective, and prevent pregnancy from 3 to 10 years depending on which type you choose. Also, IUDs are the most commonly used form of contraception around the world. Many women love them because they don't get the side effects of often as using an oral form. It's a legitimate option that isn't as severe as surgery. Not to mention that you are still quite young at 32. I'm 32 myself and just had my first child in 2018. Maybe you'll be with her forever, and maybe not, but either way it's a bit of a selfish thing to ask of you. If she is the one done having children then let her have the surgery, she has made that choice for herself, but it's unfair of her to ask that you be the one to take on the burden."

Knife_Swap,Looking for Microtech UTX-70
AskDocs,"So here is the bottom line... There is essentially three ways this can play out. 

1. This is a hormonal issue, meaning you have low testosterone. However, since you have no loss of libido, or other symptoms of low testosterone, it probably isn't hormonal. 

2. This could be a vascular problem, in which case the viagra should do the trick. Its unusual for someone your age, but based on your past experiences it could be it. 

3. Finally, the last option is neurological. This is the one you have to worry about. Neurological damage can be permanent, or take a very long time to recover from. If you try the Viagra, and it doesn't work then you could be looking at a neurological issue. 

None of these are absolute, and without a proper physical exam and lab results I am basically just guessing. I hope this provided more information. Good luck. "
AskDocs,"Without more testing its difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. I suggest you go back to your urologist and get a full work up. Testosterone test, and vascular doppler are needed to really get to the bottom of this. 

How tight was the compression ring and how did you wear it? Around the shaft only, or both your shaft and scrotum? While using the ring did you ever experience any of the following: pain, dramatic color change, numbness, tingling, urination or ejaculation of blood?"

AskDocs,"It sounds to me that your diet may be playing a bigger role than you might expect. Having the smoothie in the morning is fine, but what you are putting in the smoothie may be the problem. Peanut butter, protein powder, and bananas can cause constipation. My suggestion would be to add either peanut butter, or protein powder to your smoothies, but not both. Also, adding more green vegetables, or other fruits and vegetables high in fiber to your smoothie. You can even add soluble fiber, like Metamucil, to your smoothies. 

I would also think about changing up your other meals as well. Cut back on carbs as much as possible and replace them with green vegetables and fruits.

Another possibility is mild IBS, or you just simply ate something your body didn't like. Either way everything is moving through your bowels at an increased rate.

However, based on your MRI report its seems you have suffered some substantial damage, not only to your ACL, but also to your MCL. You have also damaged your lateral femoral condyle and your posteromedial condyle. Condyles are boney appendages that ligaments use to attach to your bones. If a ligament suffers enough trauma, not only can the ligament be damaged, but so can the condyle where it attaches. 

I am not an orthopedic surgeon, but based on my experience working in sports medicine in the past, this injury should probably be treated with surgery, followed by physical therapy.

It's true that certain allergens, like peanuts, can cause reactions very easily, even airborn molecules can cause reactions in severely allergic people. However, not all allergens are equal. Suggesting that you can't eat at a restaurant because of traces you would bring back is pretty ridiculous. If her reactions are so sensitive she wouldn't be able to go out in public for fear of coming into contact with literally any other person.

So I think I may know whats going on here. The way you have changed your washing practices are the most likely culprit. So vaginas are actually pretty amazing organs. They are self cleaning and self regulating. When you wash yourself, try to avoid directly forcing or spaying water into your vagina. The vaginal climate is very sensitive to change, which can lead to some unwelcome symptoms. However, like I said the vagina can clean and self regulate. When you wash the inside of your vagina on a regular basis, as you've described, you are unbalancing the pH and washing out/killing good bacteria. This can lead to yeast infections, smells, discharge, etc. Avoid directly washing the inside of your vagina from now on. You can also try using a feminine hygiene body wash, like Summer's Eve. Again, these products are meant to be used externally only, but will help support a healthy vaginal climate and pH.  "

As for your situation, more than likely you have nothing to worry about. Based on your other comments, you have passed stool since eating the gum, which means you don't have a blockage. Assuming you are still passing gas and going to the bathroom normally, then most likely the gum is already out of your system. 
The stomach pain, that you describe as acid-reflux, is probably exactly that, acid reflux. Try taking some TUMS or other Antacids to see if that helps. 

Stop stressing and go about your normal life. If any of your bathroom habits change, or you become constipated, then consider seeing your doctor. Outside of that, relax.

Sorry I couldn't give you a more definitive solution. "
AskDocs,"I have to agree with /u/muscleups on this. The sudden loss of feeling in your penis is alarming. I suggest getting to a doctor, preferably an urologist sooner rather than later.  "
AskDocs,"Ok, I understand a little better now. How well do you sleep? Do you find that you wake up frequently? Does you wife say you snore? Do you breath through your mouth or your nose when you sleep? During the day? Do you find that you have dry mouth in the morning? Do you have allergies or suffer from nasal congestion? "
AskDocs,"So the scaly red skin on your eyelids and knuckles are most likely eczema, but it could also be psoriasis. If you post a photo I can make a better assessment. Best thing you can do for the red areas is keep them moisturized. Eucerin brand of lotion has a type specifically for eczema. Start using that daily and see if it helps. As for the cough, its possible that you have bronchitis. If you have a productive cough for the last few months then you should see your family doctor to be treated. You may need more testing to confirm. "

AskDocs,"So I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there are many new products that are available to treat hair loss, and its more treatable than it used to be. The bad news is that hair loss is mostly genetic. Many men, and some women, suffer from what is called Male Pattern Baldness. If your dad is bald, then there is a good chance you are looking at yourself in a couple decades. There is no way to stop hair loss, only slow it down. Go to the pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist about what is available. The only way to ""cure"" baldness is with a hair transplant, but I'd say you're still a little too young. "
AskDocs,Correct.
AskReddit,"Well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penis'd, debutante. You want to start a street fight with me bring it on but you will be surprised by how ugly it gets, you don't even know my real name- I'm the fucking lizard king!"

AskDocs,"Its really hard to say since I haven't seen you or examined you. However, because of your age, I would find it highly unlikely that you had a heart attack, much less an unnoticed one. Possible? Yes. Likely? No."
AskDocs,"Yes, the stress test will most likely be performed by a cardiologist. "
AskDocs,"Was this your family doctor or a cardiologist? The diagnoses that ECG machines provides can often be incorrect. I would suggest following up with a cardiologist as having these symptoms at your age is very unusual. Don't start freaking out, but definitely get a second opinion from a specialist. "

PixelBook,I noticed you got the skin for the touch pad. Have you noticed any change in performance? Does the skin mess with the touch pad at all?

portabledabs,"Ok, that makes more sense. Sorry, I'm not up on all the nomenclature when it comes to this. I live in an illegal state, but I have a connect that gets me 1g pre-filled oil cartridges. I've used a few different batteries, but they all seem so cheap and don't really hit well after a while. I'm looking for a high quality device. Thanks for helping clarify. "

weed,Thanks!
knives,I like your style.

AskDocs,"I'm not sure where you are located or what kind of resources you have, but you may want to try contacting a specialized medical facility. There is a hospital in New York City that specializes in orthopedics and joint repair. Its called The Hospital for Special Surgery. Try contacting them and explain your situation. I know its a long shot, but never hurts to try. "
badwomensanatomy,"As a physician I would like to apologize for the lack of empathy and compassion you were shown by the first two doctors. I know that we sometimes idolize doctors as all knowing, or some sort of authority figure, but they are people like you and I. They have biases, though they shouldn't show them, just like everyone else. I'm saddens me when I hear stories like this about dismissive physicians like that I want you to know that many of us take our vocation very seriously and truly only want to help our patients. "
