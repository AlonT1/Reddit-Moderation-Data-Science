Mommit,"Netherlands. Swaddling is discouraged here for routine use. Only for problem cryers. Here it's a tightly made bed with a blanket (At the feet end of the bed, short) or a sleep sack."
ShitMomGroupsSay,"That's false. Babies have lungs by 11-12 weeks. They just don't function outside the womb yet (That's where the 24-26 week viability date comes from). 

Vaccines are also indeed created with a cell line that was once created from lung tissue of an aborted fetus. You need human cells to infect with the virus you want to create a vaccine for. The cell line is still used today, but the fetus was not aborted with the purpose of becoming a vaccine, no new fetuses are aborted for this purpose and the fetal cells do not actually end up in the vaccine

So the woman is still misinformed"

A radiologist is perfectly capable of judging a pituitary mri. There's a specific imaging protocol for it. 

I can't believe a neurosurgeon would operate on such a small tumor. It is brain surgery, and has risks. You don't operate unless not operating is harmful, like with large adenomas that compress the optic nerve. 

And the labs do trump the imaging. Tiny inactive adenomas that don't produce hormones or don't interfere with hormone production are asymptomatic.

AskDocs,"Yes, but it can't have been present for long, otherwise cbc would change."
AskDoctorSmeeee,Yes this is positive. A line is a line!
AskDocs,"The baby is not at increased risk of covid. They lack the ace2 receptors that make adults and the obese so susceptible. But in general you obviously want to keep them away from pathogens. Whether you want no visitors or some is a personal choice. 

I currently have a newborn myself and don't have anyone over with symptoms (and I have family I can trust), and anyone within 6 feet of the baby wears a mask. And no kissing or hugging etc. It's also to protect myself because I don't want to have a cold with a fresh c section wound."
AskDocs,"Yes, it's important for the statistics and so you can warn whoever you've been in contact with in the days leading up to the positive test. You're contagious before you show symptoms"
AskDocs,"If they're not on a vent then yes they're conscious and yes they experience shortness of breath. Not to the extent of panic though, that's why they're being supported in the icu, for example with high flow oxygen."

If I'm not allowed to touch the soil of this plant, I should try my other hand! Super annoying. Just know they don't do it to annoy you. My son gets time outs as long as his age after a two warnings (and the time out is explicitly mentioned in the final warning). I hardy ever have to execute it because now at 2,5 he knows I follow through. Here he gets strapped in his high chair and put in the hallway with the door to the living room shut. I don't punish tantrums though, that's not bad behavior, it's raw emotion. I tell him I see he's mad about not getting x, and then let him work through it.

But I think I'm lucky with a calm boy, because here the tantrums last 2 minutes. My sisters toddler can go nuclear for 15 minutes ðŸ˜…"

My son usually was super fussy and hungry for a day, then super sleepy for a day and then boom his clothes suddenly didn't fit and he had learned something new. But he never read the book so the timing was way different"
beyondthebump,"You're not terrible for letting him cry. If he's fed, clean and just tired a bit of crying will not harm. We have a 15 minute rule and we even use a timer for it. After 15 minutes of crying we go in and soothe, and then restart the clock. No nap is not an option. Kiddo knows you're not gone forever, they just have FOMO. 

Our toddler hardly every makes it the full 15 minutes by the way. He calms down long before that most of the time"

AskDocs,"Early morning urine albumin/creatinine ratio is an excellent screening tool for protein loss. It does not miss heavy cases, so we prefer it over 24 hour urine as a screening tool. 

For all ages the ratio should be below 3/30, depending on whether your country uses SI or standard units. 
For urine  portions there is no normal value for creatinine and albumin, it is the ratio that matters."
AskDocs,"Because they can, because it sounds good, and because you just pee out the excess of water soluble vitamins.

AskDocs,"Core body temperature is regulated in the brain. It has one set point for the whole body. Areas closer to the surface will be colder due to heat loss. This is why rectal temperature is considered the gold standard, and why oral and axillary temp is unreliable. Inflamed areas will feel warmer, but never warmer than the set core temperature."

AskDocs,"Nah, CK has to be very high to cause kidney damage. And egfr is not reliable in those with lots of muscle mass. It is calculated using creatinine levels, and if you are muscular you will always have higher creatinine levels. So if there was never any change in your creatinine levels when you have myoglobinuria, you did not suffer any kidney damage"
AskDocs,"I don't think you have a tumor at all. The symptoms you describe come from stuff that is handled by parts of the brain that are anatomically so far apart that they can't physically be caused by a single tumor. You'd be dead if that were the case. Your symptoms also wouldn't come and go as you describe. Same goes for multiple smaller tumors: you'd be way sicker, and it wouldn't come and go. If you were in my country, you wouldn't even be able to get the mri unless you went to a private scanning facility abroad. Regular doctors would refuse."
AskDocs,"Incubation is 2-12 days for a primary infection, which would not present like this. It takes 2-4 weeks to go away"
AskDocs,"Alright, but make a very clear deal with your mum that it ends with the mri. Health anxiety makes you doubt everything, even when every test in the world is normal. So if the MRI is normal, do not pursue further or repeat testing. There will always be a voice in the back of your head that makes you doubt the normal results. You need therapy to learn that that voice is not telling you the truth and should be ignored."
AskDocs,"Well if all your tests were normal, it can very well all be the physical symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety can mimic many diseases. You need to find a therapist to improve your symptoms. You're not abnormal or crazy by the way, anxiety is pretty common and it just sucks."
AskDocs,No with normal tsh and t4 there is no thyroid issue. They shouldn't have drawn Tg antibodies.
AskDocs,"I don't see any blisters, so hsv is unlikely. Plus it wouldn't fit a primary infection."
AskDocs,"Yes, tell your doctor and anesthesia team you're scared! They can talk you through the procedure, give you anti anxiety meds and make it a better experience for you. And don't forget that the mortality rate in humans is much much lower for surgeries."
AskDocs,"It can take weeks to months to test negative, even though you stop being contagious long before that."
AskDocs,You don't inflame your brain by studying. How long you can do it without causing harm is highly individual. And by harm I mostly mean symptoms of strain such as fatigue and headache. And if the perceived work load is to high it will also cause psychological issues
AskDocs,Seek medical care if you start vomiting or if you become disoriented (the latter would be noticed by someone else). Since you didn't lose consciousness you're likely fine.

AskDocs,"I see a regular sinus rhythm with two suptraventricular extra beats. With just an apple watch lead that's all I can say about it.

*11 pump for 15-20 minutes, takes 30 minutes total with cleaning and drying pump parts afterwards
*1330 pump

Rest of the day: boob as needed."

So if your rheum runs lot of ideas, ask for a referral. Given your positive family history, it could for example be a (New) genetic abnormality. Have your ESR/CRP ever been elevated? It should be if it's an inflammatory disease."
AskDocs,"It means they found something that doesn't look like cancer, but they can't fully rule it out from just the mammogram. The next step would be ultrasound."
AskDocs,"Sounds like your back muscles cramp up when you're in those positions.

I don't even own a white noise machine"
beyondthebump,"Same here, though my toddler has had phases in which he refused to open his mouth. I then just squish his head with his ear against my boob and brush anyway.

I tried it myself, and it does taste similar!

AskDocs,Asymptomatic bacteriuria sometimes happens. We do not treat it in absence of symptoms of an infection.
AskDocs,Call your insurance to see which doctor is in your network. Then call a practice and ask if you can become a patient there. They will do the rest!
AskDocs,"1 yes they are specific for the antigen that was isolated from this corona virus. The very nature of the test is that it can only tell you if your body is producing antibodies against said antigen. We look at two types, IgM (Only present in early and recent infection, disappears after a few weeks) and IgG (Present after a few weeks and stays long). It does not tell if you are currently contagious though. 

2. We don't know yet. So far at least several months. The memory cells that produce the antibodies should stay much longer

3. High dose prednisone mostly affects t cell function. Antibody producing cells are b cells. That said, t cells do aid the b cells in their job. So the antibody response may be less, but not zero, and should still result in the formation of memory b cells."
AskDocs,"It's to rule out dangerous conditions like an ectopic pregnancy, or a missed partial spontaneous abortion. You're right about it not having consequences for the fetus, it's all about mom."
AskDocs,Yes very much possible. Not much you can do about it afaik except try to ignore them.
AskDocs,"Removed, misinformation."
AskDocs,Thanks!
AskDocs,"ED, definitely. You may have caused severe burns on your esophagus and stomach, plus electrolyte and acid base disorders. Do not delay seeking care. I'm sorry you feel so bad."
AskDocs,"So far, the data does not show increased susceptibility to the disease when pregnant, and the babies don't seem be harmed either. Mortality rates are also equal. However, if you do catch it and get the dreaded pneumonia that hospitalizes a small fraction of the patients, you are at risk of it being more severe, especially in third trimester. That's because the big uterus basically reduces your lung capacity.

Safety at the workplace completely depends on the age of your students (the young ones seem less contagious and susceptible) and how your employer lets you protect yourself (distance, masks, ventilation of the classroom)

Personal anecdote: I just had a baby last week. I made it through without catching it so far, by wearing ppe and avoiding the actual covid patients. (Though I must add I only worked until the end of August). My risky contacts were all outside of work (like kissing and hugging relatives )"
