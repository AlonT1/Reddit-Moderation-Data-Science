BattlefieldV,In over 500 hours of this game I've never had server or connection issues until 5.2. Now I get jittery planes and constant ping spikes.
BattlefieldV,RLLR
BattlefieldV,I've flown planes since launch and ever since 5.2 they have been incredibly jittery as if everybody has high ping. The servers seem to be in a bad place recently.
BattlefieldV,That definitely sounds like a gpu problem. Is it overclocked? All the required power cables plugged into it? Did you buy it used? (thermal paste could be completely dried up)
BattlefieldV,"Played a 27v5 breakthrough on Navarik yesterday, lasted about 5 minutes."
BattlefieldV,I've been enjoying MW lately. The ttk is fast and gunplay is the best I've ever seen in a video game. Spend a few hours playing MW then jump on BFV and the difference in gunplay will shock you.
BattlefieldV,The product we have now is not the same product that we bought from the start.
BattlefieldV,Yes you can. HV bullets is a first tier upgrade.
BattlefieldV,Go crank the resolution scale in bfv to 200% and see what your gpu usage does.
BattlefieldV,Any sort of vsync or fps limiters turned on?
BattlefieldV,What is your cpu usage?
SFSU,"You don't have to be a music major. You should go to the office for the school of music in creative arts and ask them if it would be ok to use the room. Just like with the piano practice rooms, they'll probably want you to be at least a music minor or enrolled in a music class."
SFSU,When I was in jazz band I had access to a practice kit in the bass clef room in creative arts (I think it's room 432?) I had access to the locker and could get the key for the room and go in and practice. I'm pretty sure you have to be involved in the music program though.
PCRedDead,"Same here. Game was running and looking great yesterday, now with the same (or lower) settings, it runs noticeably worse. Also getting some artifacting issues that were never present before. There's also some weird things going on with horse handling. Attempting to go straight will cause my horse to run in circles and ignore my inputs. Update totally ruined the game for me."

pcgaming,"I personally don't notice any difference in performance on my 1080Ti with DX11 at 1440p ultra. Using ultra low latency mode, fps seems the same."
BattlefieldV,">[Nvidia is also promising](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgamescom-2019-game-ready-driver%2F) up to 23 percent framerate improvements for Apex Legends, Battlefield V, Forza Horizon 4, Strange Brigade, and World War Z.

🤔"
BattlefieldV,"Looks like it's a setting in Nvidia control panel, which defaults to off."
BattlefieldV,Interesting that they used DX12 in this chart as Nvidia themselves said that it has less of an impact in DX12 as games handle pre rendered frames instead of the game driver. Should be a bigger improvement in DX11
BattlefieldV,"I don't have shadowplay enabled so there was no way to provide a video. I followed him as he drove all the way to G, and my car ran into the tanks invisible body which is how I even noticed him in the first place."
pcars,"Supersampling, anti ailising, and make sure you don't use -vrnomirror as a launch parameter incase you are (using it ruins the resolution for me)"
pcars,You're welcome!
pcars,"90% gpu usage is not ""massively cpu bound"""
pcars,"Exactly, just find what works best on your hardware. FPSVR has a good interface for changing SS from inside VR and shows you what your changes equate to."
pcars,"Global is 150%, pcars specific is 90% (which equals 135%)"
simracing,"No ac unit in this one, just a normal fan! Although ac would be nice..."
simracing,Yet they still can't get their QC sorted out 🙄
simracing,I have about 250 hrs in AC but it was not in vr. By the time I went to vr I was exclusively playing pcars 2 which has excellent vr support. Your system should have no problem running either. I run pc2 at a mix of medium and high settings at 1.5 SS and get a steady 90 fps in everything except the harshest conditions (full car grid+dusk+rain) AC has simpler graphics so you should be just fine
simracing,In my opinion if you're ready to start buying serious gear for simracing I think not being on PC is going to eventually bottleneck your experience. If i had my g920 and an Xbox I would've probably spent the money building a pc first and then upgrading my gear later.
simracing,This shifter is so much fun to use! It's nice to no longer use paddles for sequential lever cars. And the H pattern is so satisfying! So much weight and a nice clunk to it.
simracing,"I moved to it from an original Odyssey which was already great. There's 0 screendoor effect and the resolution is excellent. The hand tracking could be better, but was perfectly fine for 99% of games. But all I use it for now is simracing, and for that it's great. The face pad is also pretty uncomfortable after a while, I got a vrcover which fixed that. Just make sure you have the pc to drive it (it's higher resolution will require more power than vive/rift) or be ready to turn down the supersampling. I just upgraded my pc from a 1070ti to a 1080ti and im finally happy with the performance."
simracing,My first session with the new setup I did a 0:00.01 split time my second lap! It really is amazing how much of a difference it makes.
simracing,"I haven't tried the CSL elites myself but I have heard the optional load cell is great in them. If it's anything like the CSW I think you would be very happy with the upgrade. The feel is very good and I am noticeably more consistent. Braking with the G920 for me was just stomping on it until I was slowed enough, now I feel like I can actually be precise and trail brake effectively."
simracing,"That's the one! Moving from a G920 was night and day, going from a G25 will be a massive upgrade. It's expensive but I think it's worth it! I would definitely have trouble going back to my G920 after trying out some serious gear. Plus you enter the fanatec ecosystem which will make upgrading super easy (DD2 would probably be my next upgrade, but that will be a way down the line!)"
simracing,Odyssey+
simracing,"You'll love it! In my 300 hours of pcars2 with a G920, playing it with this makes it feel like a completely different game. Every car feels like a new experience again."
simracing,"What an unbelievable difference! I've been using a G920 for 4 years now and I have always been pretty satisfied with it, and I did not expect such an improvement! Unfortunately my universal hub has 2 buttons that are acting up so I will be RMAing it for a replacement, but the time I got to spend with it beforehand has left me very impressed!"
Fanatec,What was their refund process like? Everything packaged in original boxes with accessories and all of that? How long did it take to get your money back?
simracing,"Yes I know of the redundant buttons on the top. But it is detecting inputs from other button box buttons. The rotary dial is especially strange, as using the directional d-pad will detect a downshift from the paddles and a couple of other buttons. So in game, when I use the dial, the car will downshift. And it's not a keybind issue in the game, it happens in the software too."
simracing,What a shame. Wheel feels great but I think the hub must have a wiring or board issue. Hope it doesn't take too long to get a response from support. Thanks for your help
simracing,"On the universal hub page it just says to use the latest wheelbase driver, when I try clicking the two update buttons in the fanatec control panel it says both are up to date. Am I maybe looking in the wrong place?"
simracing,"Yeah, I downloaded 328 for my OS from their website before plugging in the hub as they stated in their manual."
wallstreetbets,Bet
simracing,Put about 15 hours into it and have absolutely no complaints to report!
simracing,You got a nice setup man! I only race in vr though so no need for a screen :) 
simracing,You won't be disappointed!
simracing,"Yep! Unfortunately I've had some bad luck with it. This is my 3rd replacement in 3 years. First one had a pedal problem and second one had a wheel problem. But logitech support was great and replaced them quickly for free, and logitech wheels are generally more reliable than the other options on the market. When I got my first one I paid 400 and now theyre around 250, for that price id say it's a no brainer! "

Chiropractic,You're welcome! Glad I could answer your questions.
Chiropractic,"I don't feel it makes a whole lot of sense to make exclusions to rules for specific users as an override to other rules. Chiros asserting their credentials in the sub have commonly started large arguments which are difficult to moderate and not fun for anyone involved. Not necessarily as a fault of the advice being given, but just due to the controversy. As I said in my other comment, good advice will always rise to the top regardless of credentials being known."
Chiropractic,">And then this morning a bot tells me I can no longer identify myself as a chiro.

This policy is a couple of months old now and certainly not aimed specifically at chiros. We were having a *lot* of issues with fakes identifying themselves as doctors with malicious intent. One incident in specific was a random guy identifying himself as an OBGYN to solicit naked photos of users. We implemented this to prevent people from lying about credentials to victimize users.

I'd also like some more information on the user that was threatening you, if you feel inclined. If that user is verified and sending threats like that I don't want them on our subreddit.

Finally, you are still free to give advice without a flair or identifying your credentials. Good advice will always rise to the top organically as we have seen with many unverified doctors and other MPs. If you have any other concerns please feel free to mention them. "
Chiropractic,"Hello, I'm the founder of the subreddit. The mod team recently reevaluated our verification system and decided to include chiropractors in the new exclusions based on unanimous agreement by the physicians of the mod team. There was not one specific instance that triggered this change, it was simply an update to our terms. We have no flaired chiropractors (or if we do, they're no longer active) so no flairs were gone and removed. Everything I said also applies to premed students and ND's.

I wasn't claiming the market is going up, I was showing an objective chart which shows that sentiment is bullish as I, the article, and your countering response says - 0.75 and lower is bullish sentiment, bearish if you are a contrarian. Not everybody follows this as a contrarian. If you do, you're bearish when everybody else is bullish (as the ratio shows everybody is). When I was saying that the options market is bullish I am referring to sentiment, referring to the market as the investors within it."
options,Mod that banned me must've had calls
options,You're right. This just shows sentiment. It's not an indicator.
options,"I don't use pc ratio at all in my trading. I find it especially unreliable looking at specific stocks. I thought this was worth sharing though as it usually matches the market for the day, ie high put volume on red days and vice versa. The inverse today shows a sign of changing sentiment."
stocks,"Lol if you had ~$70,000 equity in GE at current price you'd get a $100 dividend. Better than nothing I guess"
options,Nothing allows you to farsee. I'm not claiming this does. 
options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a431bc/options_market_is_very_bullish_today_despite/ebb4s3v
options,You're absolutely right. Nobody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow or what the purpose of the option transactions are. Perhaps this ratio is an oversimplification but if somebody gets something valuable out of it then I feel it was worth sharing.
options,"Man I must've really triggered you. This is not my analysis, it's the analysis of td ameritrade - https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/use-the-pc-ratio-to-gauge-sentiment-15058 and they do mention that the inverse is the case if you follow it as a contrarian. It would've also been incorrect to inverse it yesterday as it showed higher put volume and then the market crashed down today. It's an objective sentiment ratio, how you interpret it is up to you.

Also note I said the *market* is bullish. They are. There's more call than put volume. Whether or not they're right is a different story."
options,"I'm not sure why you're being so pedantic, of course it's a ratio. I called it an index simply because it is listed as one by thinkorswim (hence the $ in the ticker) If it's a reliable contrarian indicator then it sure was wrong yesterday when it was at 1.03. As for the source of my numbers, they're from here - https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/use-the-pc-ratio-to-gauge-sentiment-15058

I'm not making any claims posting this, I just thought it was interesting and a good resource for others to know about. But you do you boo"

Looking at p/c for individual options can be misleading for the reason you brought up, but looking at the entire market is much more reliable. Also every sell = someone buying."
options,"SPY IV percentile is 47 right now, elevated from YTD average but still not too bad (it was at 100 at the crash in February). If you think we're gonna see more swings (I am finding it hard to believe we're gonna see 4+ tops but who knows) then I'd buy calls at ~2600 and sell them/buy puts at ~2800."
options,The support at 2600 and resistance at 2800 is crazy. I don't think we're going to break out of it until trade war and fed tensions are completely eased.
options,"I interpret this as the option market thinking this is the bottom for the time being and anticipating future increases. Yesterday, despite the 800 point drop, the ratio never broke out of neutral and was even bearish. With another 500pt drop today people are probably seeing it as impossible to go any lower."
options,It's an index that thinkorswim created called $PSCP. It shows a ratio of puts to calls being bought for the day. This is PCSP - only showing SP500. There's also PCALL which is the whole market. I then added price lines at the ratio points and chart labels as a reminder to myself

If there were more buyers and sellers it would find its true price which I can promise is nowhere near where it's at right now. In the future look at the difference between bid and ask. If it's a big difference do NOT trade it.

Selling it at that price is going to be nothing more than a stroke of luck, ie somebody is extremely bullish in a very short period of time and wants your option *immidiately* and is willing to pay a massive premium at your ask instead of setting his limit at the mid/bid like most do. In other words it's probably not going to happen."

It's going to take forever to fill, assuming it ever does, and there would be so much bleed from illiquidity there's no way you'll close it at the price you want.

RobinHood,If you leg in like that you'll have to buy the short position back first then sell the long position afterwards.
wallstreetbets,Yep my 1m graph is showing more dollar loss than I've ever even had in my account. 
RobinHood,I can't even tell if these posts are real anymore
wallstreetbets,F
wallstreetbets,This aged well
RobinHood,They hold the max risk as collateral. If the max risk is higher than the max profit the transaction is essentially a debit.
stocks,"That's a private company, so you must own shares of a public conglomerate that owns them. What's the name of the ""shareholder company"" you were referring to?"
stocks,Whatever you own stock in that paid you the dividend.

StockMarket,Verizon earnings success has me up 32% 😎
investing,Bad troll attempt
wallstreetbets,😂😂
wallstreetbets,Read this back to yourself
RobinHood,You'd really sell a stock at a loss the same day you bought it? It's a stupid idea to even entertain the idea of buying a stock that you fear will crash on that same day if you are that scared of having red days. It will go back up if it is a good company. You're going to lose a lot of money if triggering stop losses on the day you buy the stock seems like a good idea to you.
RobinHood,This is a non issue. Why are you setting stop losses that are so close to the current price it's at risk of executing the same day you buy it? Your hands are that weak? 
RobinHood,... Or just set it after a day passes?
wallstreetbets,"You took a 5k loan on a risky options bet and don't understand basic options terminology?

You truly belong here"
LifeProTips,I'm on a galaxy s9+ and I have YouTube picture in picture without having red
wallstreetbets,Lmao that's more than Nike is worth.
wallstreetbets,"Your 270 buys are being used as collateral for your 270 writes. You can't sell your buys or you'll have no collateral for your writes unless you deposit cash. To sell your buys you need to first buy your writes.

Learn how spreads work before you play with so much money. "
RobinHood,It usually takes 3 to 5 days. Robinhood is a limited margin account by default which verifies that you have the funds in your account then essentially loans you the amount to instantly trade until its withdrawn from your bank.
RobinHood,Barchart
options,"Barchart for a simple online one.

Thinkorswim is better in every way if you feel like making a tdameritrade account."
stocks,Bruh
StockMarket,I personally think the worst is behind us and the sell off is over. I think it will be green tomorrow. But nobody knows.
options,This is gonna be a fun week
stocks,Holy shit you should not be trading stocks
Music,Plays on soundcloud don't get you anywhere if they all hate your music dude. That's not how you make it in music. You're delusional. 
RobinHood,That $10 is already gone. Try a paper trade platform first and figure out what you're doing.
wallstreetbets,The white house announced trump is meeting with xi to ease trade tension which seems to be giving people confidence. I'll be extremely surprised if we don't finish green tomorrow
wallstreetbets,I hope that 1 Google share turns things around for you
wallstreetbets,At 288 now lol
stocks,Hoping the banks have successful earnings and prop the market up a bit
stocks,10/19 still has hope imo if your strike was conservative
options,Robinhood allows commission free trading and supports spreads. I use ToS for research and use RH to execute orders. Both are free
wallstreetbets,Why's everyone talking about Ford?
wallstreetbets,Rsi has been in the high 70s/80s for a while now. Its bound to correct eventually. 
RobinHood,Oh my god

wallstreetbets,If it means buying puts then snap is definitely the winner. 
wallstreetbets,You critique a lot of posts in this sub yet never post yourself. Why don't you enlighten us with your superior sense of humor? 
options,I haven't seen these pre defined strategies myself although I have heard of them. What is an example of a stock that has them? 
options,"If you successfully build an iron condor, RH will call it ""Iron Condor"" instead of 4 option strategy."
options,ToS has the best customer support I've ever encountered. Click the support chat button in the top right and open a ticket. They usually respond almost instantly.
RobinHood,"If you're referring to rh setting the price a bit higher than it's currently at, it does that to protect from volatility. Always use limit order."
investing,"Interesting interpretation considering I never used the number 2b. Op seemed to be implying startups with his question, but perhaps I misinterpreted him and he was indeed talking about billion dollar companies."
investing,Where did I call 2b a startup?
investing,"Risk and uncertainty. Nobody knows what's gonna happen to ABC startup in a month, it's stock could drop 50% in a week for all we know. That happening to a company like Amazon is highly unlikely. "
investing,2.5b
wallstreetbets,It's called Most Active Options
StockMarket,Do utilities typically stay green in a bear trend? It's the only industry in the 500 that didn't finish majority red.
stocks,I liked barchart a lot but since I got thinkorswim I've used it for everything.
