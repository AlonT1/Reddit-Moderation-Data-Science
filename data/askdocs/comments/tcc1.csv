emergencymedicine,Whoah 55 beds 1 doc?
emergencymedicine,Are you a physician? cmg?
AskDocs,He was evaluated at the ED and discharged?
medicine,Why the downvotes?
medicine,is there a good peer reviewed paper on the covid19 vaccines or mrna vaccines?
AskDocs,ER physician. An ectopic can wait overnight if no pain light-headedness or dizziness.
medicine,Probably an anesthesia question but why TIVA for a 8 hour case?
AskDocs,"thanks, but no thanks for the horrible advice."
AskDocs,"Unfortunately no but it will be a ""top"" in this reddit if you ever need to find it again."
AskDocs,Amen. Consider getting verified if you have a medicine related certification.
AskDocs,"I can't think of anything more poignant and impactful than what was accomplished with his post, the honest emotional response from reddit, and the love it brought to a man in his last moments.

AskDocs,i would definitely follow up with a burn center. like soon
StLouis,nicely done! that's it i'm pretty sure.
audio,thanks for the help!
audio,"i have no interest in the ""smart speakers"" - i think an accessory playing device is probably the right way to go.  I think an MPD is going to be too complex for my wife to use easily.  Is there a way to make the tablet/cheap phone controllable via bluetooth?"
AskDocs,check the cdc for return to work guidelines  - it is not a testing based strategy.
AskDocs,why are you being tested after you're positive? i do not think test of cure is necessary or even indicated as you will stay positive for some weeks.
Wilmington,Yeah
AskDocs,Need a picture.  What antiseptic wipe?
AskDocs,tell your parents.
AskDocs,Comes from the lunula - would show this to a dermatologist.
AskDocs,Hard to say what it is without more information.  Fever and chest pain is suggestive of pneumonia.  Pericarditis may cause pain that is worse with laying back. Musculoskeletal pain can be similar. As can pleurisy.  Pulmonary embolism may have pain similar to this.  A trial of ibuprofen is reasonable if you are otherwise feeling well.
AskDocs,"this language is inappropriate and not tolerated on this reddit. if you cant disagree agreeably, you can leave."
AskDocs,"History of anxiety? Need physical therapy/vestibular rehab and an ENT evaluation. If anxiety also, then there is an interaction there and the anxiety as well needs to be treated."
AskDocs,Responses that include simply laughing at this person's question are going to lead to a ban as it has for 4 people already in this thread.
AskDocs,i would call your surgeon cuz honestly that's what the ED doc is going to do when you get there.
AskDocs,"not sure what you mean? needs emergency evaluation of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, meningitis, etc."
AskDocs,"This sounds like orthostasis (drop in blood pressure secondary to change in position). POTS is a type of excessive response to standing. Vomiting is not typically associated. Orthosasis is typically managed by increasing fluid and electrolyte intake.  If this continues, see a doctor to rule out other causes of decreased intravascular volume."
AskDocs,Thread is devolving into a litany of homemade concoctions and old wives tails.  Agree with the physician response. Everything else is at best a guess or anecdotal. Thread locked.  OP - would not assume you have the vid until you've been tested.

headphones,does that mean buying tips not from campfire? how do i make sure they would work? recommendations?
emergencymedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910610/
headphones,Will this work with my tiny ear hole
headphones,"Budget - <1500 USD, less is better


Source - macbook pro, pixel 4, do have an amp but don't use it often


Requirements for Isolation - would like good iso


Will you be using these Headphones in Public? yes


Preferred Type of Headphone - IEM preferred


Preferred tonal balance - Balanced with some bass emphasis


Past headphones - Customart music 2's - i think because i had to switch back to the acrylic headphones because of a small right ear canal the fit was never right and the sound has been kindof hollow and unimpressive.


Also have sony xba-n3ap. Really great headphones, right ear does BARELY with the smallest foam earpiece


Preferred Music - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY8tAKDVxK8 


What would you like to improve on from your set-up - More detail, more bass, the last pair of headphones i'm going to buy. seriously.


It has to be able to fit a small right ear canal. Can send pictures or measurements of my custom2's right earphone so you can get a sense."
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,probably time to see a doctor.
AskDocs,Vomiting blood and a fast heart rate is not normal. See a doctor immediately. ER is fine. Thread locked.
AskDocs,"Depends on which assay they are using. For elisa testing less than 500 ng/ml fibrin equivalent units, 250 ng/ml d dimer units"
AskDocs,No. D-dimers can be elevated in the absence of clot.
AskDocs,"ED physician here. I would want to make sure there was no concomitant kidney stone in this setting.  If you are feeling worse it is reasonable to be re-evaluated. In general it may take a day or two of antibiotics to feel improved but if you are feeling worse, please be seen."
AskDocs,"COVID19 elevates d-dimer levels.  Anticoagulation based on a high d-dimer without clinical signs of veno/arterial thrombosis is based on expert opinion only and of unclear benefit.  ""She could have died"" simply because her d-dimer was high is a bit of a stretch in someone without prior history of clots."
AskDocs,Removed. Claiming credentials requires verification in this Reddit. See sidebar
emergencymedicine,I don't think MY NPV is good enough if I have enough concern. And that pretest probability is near nil if the patient has no signs of AVS.
emergencymedicine,Take a look at the sensitivity of the ER physician doing the hints exam
emergencymedicine,I disagree. The presentation of acute vertiginous syndrome is very different than BppV. I don't think you're so good at hints that you can use both and not anchor without realizing your hints was abnormal
emergencymedicine,Your dix hall pike can be positive in central vertigo
emergencymedicine,What was your neuro exam during the vertigo? What did you suspect it was from? Was the patient actually ambulated?
AskDocs,Should heal fine
emergencymedicine,You should not perform a dix hallpike and hints exam on the same pt almost ever.
emergencymedicine,Discharge. Stop consulting. Do your own exam
AskDocs,Looks fortunately superficial at this point. Topical bacitracin and tylenol/ibuprofen. Watch for worsening (bubbles in skin which indicates a more severe burn
AskDocs,need verification to claim credentials in this reddit. see sidebar. post removed
AskDocs,Do not post this in here again.
emergencymedicine,Sure. In rural underserved areas and I could probably do ok at a day in clinic if I was actually interested in preventative medicine. They are not equivalent. BCEM here
emergencymedicine,Because EM is a specialty. I know how to do FM about as well as FM knows how to do EM.
AskDocs,I'm guessing because you were feeling lightheaded your blood pressure was low and your pulse ox was not accurately detecting your heart rate/oxygenation.    Drink plenty of fluids - preferably with some electrolytes in it.  Eat normally.  Contact your doctor but try not to worry too much as it does sound heat related/exhaustion
AskDocs,"Agree with this excellent reply.  Just wanted to emphasize one of the more important things to watch for is how your infant is feeding.  Infants who have effortful, sweaty, poor feeds are failing the ""stress test"" that is feeding and can be a sign of heart trouble.  This would be something to immediately bring up to your pediatrician."

AskDocs,i can't believe people are still getting xrays for facial fractures
AskDocs,You cannot feel an abnormally long or short qt. You might feel the effects of an arrhythmia but that's not the same
AskDocs,looks normal. QTC is not more than 50% of the R-R interval. I calculate it at 410ms
AskDocs,can you post your ekg?

flashlight,thank you kindly!!
flashlight,thanks! i have the sofirn sp36 which seems to be at a higher pricepoint.  what's with the lower price on this flashlight? what am i missing?
flashlight,"> Here’s a video about it

I really love my sofirn sp36 (how I found this reddit!) and i""m looking for something to one up it..  That imalent MS18 is ""too intense"" in that its quite loud, and its too big.  What's in between? This light is going to be something to pull out to play with, show off to friends, and occasionally used for tasks such as looking in the basement, walking at night, looking in the back yard."
flashlight,"wow - touche! i am not sure of his current lights or that I can describe them to you.  I suspect they are all <50 dollars, ""over the counter"" and of the ubiquitous variety. None of them are anything like the Sofirn SP36 that I have, for instance, which is my first foray into a quality light. I think high quality, an easy to use interface with button(s) that feel good to use, and a compact, very bright size would be best.  Some additional modes (strobe, ramping, etc) i think are a plus."

AskDocs,Nothing about this makes sense
espresso,Should I keep all my accessories and get the upgraded lelit Anna or just abandon ship and get a flair2
espresso,I think I WDT. I grind into the portafilter then make concentric circles with an unfolded small paperclip
espresso,Thanks for your response. There is not a pressure gauge
espresso,So too late on the grinder as I gave it away. Was having channeling using a tamper .. so hence leveler. Still channeling now and the bottomless portafilter is leaking over the side. Is this machine incapable or is it me
AskDocs,well its possible you are developing upper urinary infection symptoms which macrobid will not treat.  if i had your culture I would go with Cephalexin
AskDocs,Cipro is fine. Not my first choice but in this case it will work.
AskDocs,Pcn and diclox? Why? Missing a lot of CoNS so.. not my first choice for a human bite
AskDocs,Do you know the sensitivities to the e. Coli? Cipro is often not a great choice because of high rates of resistance but in general a short course of Cipro is well tolerated  (250 bid x 3d for uncomplicated UTI)
AskDocs,If she is in a facility designed to treat alcohol withdrawal That's the right place for her. It's probably time to contact them to see what the plan is
LifeProTips,"incredibly rare and presents with other features besides redness.  also, don't confuse the speed of spread with the timing of onset. I'm much more concerned when its day 3-4 and the redness begins."

AskDocs,agree.
AskDocs,"of the GI bleeds you see, a high percentage use or abuse nsaids.  There is a much higher proportion of people who use OTC Ibuprofen and have great benefit and don't have GI bleeds. You are biased by the pts you see."
AskDocs,"my apologies I don't have time to read your wall of text but the gist that I understood was an individual with possible psychiatric illness that intends harm to you or your loved ones. I am not trying to be rude by not reading.  The tldr is If you are in the states, look into involuntary commitment paperwork.  Not sure where you are. In some (?all) states an individual can petition a magistrate to commence paperwork for an emergency, involuntary if necessary, psychiatric evaluation. Paging /u/poketheveil"
AskDocs,"pictures are terrible quality and don't add anything. fever, vomiting and skin findings consistent with possible bullae are worthwhile of a visit to a doctor who doesn't prescribe ""doxycycline"" for ""the beginning stages of necrotizing fasciitis"". ER is appropriate."

Wilmington,More dollar generals to purchase important unique supplies
AskDocs,could be. to the ER with ya
AskDocs,what are the daily doses that seem to result in damage? what's the definition of damage? is it sustained or transient? like you said it seems a nightly dose 10-15mg/kg for several weeks seems unlikely to be dangerous.
AskDocs,I think the most qualified person has rendered their opinion. I have no reason to disagree and nothing to add. Instead of making /u/WreckedEmKilledEm feel like they have to defend every statement we are just going to lock this and call it good.

emergencymedicine,Collateral damage indeed. That sucks.
AskDocs,I tend to agree although I'm hesitant to give a fully committed response and I think a conversation with the PCP is the right way to go.  The good news is that most ERs have instituted some sort of compartmentalization for infectious and noninfectious complaints.
AskDocs,Anecdotal report - needs formal study.
AskDocs,Post removed
emergencymedicine,Link to cdc saying this?
emergencymedicine,ED attending here too - I wouldn't have thought so either but our hospital is putting people in full PPE + CAPRs in the triage area so not sure if I was missing something.
emergencymedicine,Do you need an N95 to swab people? Honest question
AskDocs,can use a telemedicine service maybe?
AskDocs,enough.
AskDocs,yes you should be tested. a flu swab if negative then a covid test.  Contact your local health department.
AskDocs,"you should have a flu swab. if negative, you should be swabbed for covid. you are medium to high risk for having the illness if you were within the presence of this person for more than 15 minutes."
medicine,yep

medicine,"That seems hardly appropriate. It either is or isn't airborne. If it is and you wantr to surgical mask, well that's not okay."
medicine,It seems somewhat disparate whether or not this thing is airborne. Our hospital is deescalating from N95 unless bipap or neb or not intubation etc.. but there's papers showing it being transmitted airborne? What the flip?
AskDocs,"2 tablets every 4 hours would be 6 grams, so exactly what I said"
AskDocs,yes you could.
AskDocs,yep. 1-2 weeks after fertilization until +hcg
AskDocs,"strep is more likely. antibiotics, call your doctor."
AskDocs,Yes. You should have a pregnancy test before the procedure.
AskDocs,"1000mg every six hours, not every 4 hr."
AskDocs,the incubation can be as long as 14 days.  the current symptoms are unlikely but not impossibly covid
AskDocs,This is not a fever in any sense.
AskDocs,It's more the absence of one doesn't exclude infection. And no the specificity of a high wbc is not such that it means the only possibly is appendicitis.
AskDocs,not a reliable one!
AskDocs,Appendicitis serum pcr obv
AskDocs,well that's not really why you would get a CT scan
AskDocs,"i wonder if you have a ventral hernia after your surgery.  not sure. Honestly the non contrast CT would be a fine place to start but if you are very skinny it may be a bit more challenging to make things out.  Regardless as mentioned this is a common tumor that grows unusual parts (hair, teeth, etc) but that's all it is.  You're not pregnant, you don't have a twin."
AskDocs,yes you need to wait some time and then EMG. it can take 3-4 months
AskDocs,yes
AskDocs,Congratulations on cutting back! the liver findings should be followed up with an ultrasound and liver function tests. with cessation it should resolve

AskDocs,and **S**ystemic **S**ymptoms. nope.
AskDocs,i think if your doctor is truly lost at this point they need to refer you to someone who isnt
AskDocs,"there's a workup for persistent elevation of LFTs that your doctor needs to either do or refer you to someone to do. An ultrasound, CT and hepatitis panel is a start but is insufficient."
AskDocs,"got it. ok no its fine, reference ranges are helpful as the units and the lab may be different since I'm not in your country.  those labs show some minimal elevation with a predominantly hepatocellular pattern and some mild elevation of INR.  Have you had hepatitis panel? why do you have angina at age 25? how was that diagnosed? do you drink alcohol? do you have a cardiomyopathy or other heart condition? iron level? hemachromatosis, wilsons disease? autoimmune hepatitis?"
AskDocs,sorry is the R: your result?
AskDocs,can you post your LFTs/labs and results of scan? what other medication are you on?
AskDocs,You need to see a doctor as soon as possible. This does not have to do with your gaba receptors.
AskDocs,No.
AskDocs,Good luck. Feel better soon
AskDocs,almost all covid-19 have fever. that said if you are short of breath you need to be seen. call ahead to your ER and go in.

AskDocs,Has she had an MRI of her brain and cervical spine?
AskDocs,normal amniotic fluid doesnt have a smell.
AskDocs,https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/
AskDocs,that would not be a standard way of determining whether or not there has been rupture of membranes.
AskDocs,i think getting the kegel balls out is a reasonable place to start.  you probably need a real exam though
AskDocs,In someone your age COVID-19 may well be clinically indistinguishable from a viral respiratory infection - because it simply is one.

AskDocs,lol at need ENT credentials to evaluate eye injuries in the ER.  ENTs do not typically evaluate for eye injuries of the globe.
AskDocs,Sounds like an umbilical hernia? If it just hurts to move it can wait. If it hurts constantly the skin changes color you are vomiting or not passing gas or have a fever go to the ER

AskDocs,"Huh, thought it almost always had some diarrhea with it. TIL"
AskDocs,"gastro without diarrhea? flu swab for fever is pretty standard with high prevalence. vomiting, in my experience in the ED seeing a lot of febrile kids, isn't really too specific in the young ones.  Also, yes, fever in UTI suggests an upper UTI/aka pyelo. Pedantics but still a UTI"
AskDocs,yes it can cause those symptoms.  UAs can be falsely positive. It will be important to see what the culture shows. Results should be (preliminarily) available within 24 hours.

AskDocs,i'm saying most cases of PANDAS have positive testing.  Recent treatment does not exclude a current infection causing PANDAS
AskDocs,"I'm not your doctor, but, I would know that most cases of PANDAS respond to antibiotics. A negative strep culture would make PANDAS less likely. A positive culture should prompt repeat treatment.  I'm not an expert in this though"
AskDocs,i think PANDAS is a reasonable concern - but most improve with antibiotic therapy.
AskDocs,just to be clear a normal EEG does not rule out seizures (i don't think that is what this is)

Foamed,"In prophylaxis trials, oseltamivir reduced symptomatic influenza participants (patients with symptoms of flu) by 55% (NNT = 33) and households (NNT = 8)...

Neuraminidase inhibitors provided 67 – 89% protection for individuals following prophylaxis...

Clinical Take Home Point: Neuraminidase inhibitors may provide some effectiveness to direct transmission of influenza at the individual and household level, but there is no evidence that confirms or refutes the impact at a community transmission level."

AskDocs,I think that information and the trend of your hemoglobins since a little before september up to now is vital. If you are having consistent persistent vomiting and a downtrending hemoglobin that will require IV iron and/or urgent EGD or at least a visit with GI. Its that simple - anything else is malpractice.
AskDocs,"how is it you know the results of your testing for ""chronic lyme's disease"" but not the most single relevant number regarding your ongoing problem? can you find out?"
AskDocs,or its not as severe or the vomit is not actually bloody and serial hemoglobin have disproven this being an emergency and further ER visits are not indicated. we have a low threshold to admit hematemesis (see glasgow-hatchford score).  That she hasn't been admitted for this problem suggests it does not require additional ER visits. The alternative is multiple ERs are performing malpractice and/or we don't have all the details.
AskDocs,this isn't a thing.
AskDocs,what is your hemoglobin?
AskDocs,i'm not sure more ER visits are the solution here. A few trips to the ER with discharge suggests stability. She needs an endoscopy. I would start a PPI if not already done.
AskDocs,the pain sounds like its radicular or related to irritated nerves.

medicine,"Looking at the paper more closely, of the 0.7% of kid with ABM, none had HSV meningitis. 4/5 kids were <12 mo old. All had abnormal exams. All had pneumococcal meningitis.  Hence why incomplete vaccination would be of concern in a complex febrile seizure kid."
medicine,I'd be curious to see data showing the frequency of ABM in this population with complex feb sz.
medicine,You're right - the paper I am referring to also misquoted the guidelines!  Different article discussing frequency of HSV meningitis in complex feb seizure kids https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(16)31391-9/abstract
medicine,"the 2011 AAP guidelines state you should consider LP for kids 6-12 mo (agree <6mo is a different bag) if immunizations are incomplete or if pretreated with abx.  That's for non-ill appearing kids - if you're sick, you're getting the shabang."
medicine,There are several studies that show a very low incidence of meningitis overall for complex feb seizures unless the exam is concerning for meningitis. Can you discuss this disparity? Did you have ebm or just anecdote for this recommendation?
