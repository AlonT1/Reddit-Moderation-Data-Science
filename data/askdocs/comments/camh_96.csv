It is always a better idea to contact a medical professional, not all of them are greedy, corrupt people just wanting money, they genuinely care about your health, because it's their job. 


If they stuff something up, its not because they wanted to, and as you alluded to in your post, they are only human.


 If they care about their reputation and professional credentials, they will take all steps to remedy it.

To fix: (This assumes you have adb and fastboot installed. If you don't, get it here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=42407269)

1: Copy the ROM somewhere in your computer, I recommend the a folder in c drive called android, and we will use it for this example. Extract the file called boot.img and put in the root directory

2: Backup everything
 
3: Wipe data, factory reset, cache and dalvik cache.

4: Flash ROM, then gapps

5: Once done, hook up your phone to the computer, open minimal adb&fastboot, then enter ""adb reboot bootloader""

6: Enter the adb command ""fastboot flash boot boot.img""

7: Reboot. Should boot up. "
techsupport,"Hi there. Right now it sounds like you have the Black Screen of Death, which means there is a very serious issue preventing it from booting. You might have installed an incomplete package. 

Any more information? 

With what you have given me can you try booting off a usb? To do this: As soon as you turn on the computer, there should be a message like: ""Press F12 for boot menu"" or something along those lines. For this example we will use F12, **it will be different for your computer, depending on the brand.** Turn on the computer, and keep pressing F12 until you get into a new menu. There should be something there about a boot order. Set it to USB. Put in USB, restart your computer, and it should try boot off the USB.
