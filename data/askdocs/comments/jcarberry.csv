FTFY"
AskDocs,Agree that it sounds like visual snow but likely still merits evaluation by an ophthalmologist and/or neurologist and an MRI to rule out rarer but more serious causes.
AskDocs,Exceedingly normal. We often ask patients to come in early in case things get bumped or canceled. For example if a patient ahead of you ate that morning or their lab work came back abnormal then you get to go faster. But on the flip side if things are delayed (which they frequently are) its not uncommon to be waiting many hours past your scheduled start time.
AskDocs,Dumping syndrome (to be distinguished from early gastric emptying which there is also minimal evidence for here) happens after gastric surgery. Where are you assuming that OP had this done?

AskDocs,"Yes, possibly. I'm not a psychiatrist so I don't know much about switching between those meds. You could call your doctor who is prescribing them for you to tell them what you're feeling and check that they don't want you to do anything differently."
AskDocs,Picking it at it can cause more skin breakdown and actually increase the risk of infection. It should work its way out in its own but if it remains symptomatic it'd be better for OP to see their PCP or go to an urgent care to have it removed.
AskDocs,No. Drink some water and stop checking at home. If you remain symptomatic call your PCP for a formal evaluation. They can check orthostatics in the office much more accurately than you can at home.
AskDocs,"Knowing your age would be very helpful here but you've certainly significantly exceeded the maximum dose either way. The drug is a stimulant which is why you haven't been able to sleep. What you're experiencing is certainly not normal.

You can just say you don't feel well if you don't want to go into specifics, but it's important to be honest when you see your doctor. Remember, they are ethically and legally obligated to protect your privacy except for rare circumstances (which I do not think would apply here)."
AskDocs,"True bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in infants but still quite rare. Infectious conjunctivitis is overwhelmingly viral. Antibacterial eyedrops are not unreasonable when you don't have an ophthalmologist to examine the eyes but they're almost always doing nothing. Even when it is bacterial, something like chlamydia is also not going to respond to topical eyedrops alone. 

NLDO as suggested by /u/Matt_MD2B is a reasonable thought for recurrent pinkeye type symptoms, especially if there's any associated swelling in the corner of the eye / side of the adjacent nose. This should be easily detected on exam with a pediatric ophthalmologist, so a referral may be in order. This frequently resolves on its own in infants, but an ophthalmologist who examines her can provide you with more detailed information."

AskDocs,"People with COPD have a low reserve and get sick easily. The fever suggests that she may have a lung infection, and it's common for the body's compensatory abilities to be diminished when this happens. I don't have enough information to help you determine whether you can expect a full recovery, but it's an excellent question for her doctors. I would also expect them to chdck her O2 when she walks when she is ready for discharge to determine if she will need supplemental O2 at home."
AskDocs,"
>I did a laser surgery two years ago but due to gentics my pupil sare bigger then normal so the docter wasn't able to do a complete fix  it improved but did't return completely

Laser eye surgery is more dangerous to your vision than wearing glasses. It's a very reasonable option when you don't want to wear glasses, but too many patients equate ""not wearing glasses"" to ""having good vision"" and the two are very different. 

You will also need reading glasses starting in your 40s as you become presbyopic. 

> Is there any foods or medicine or exercises to improve it 

No

> I learned that elderberry is used to improve vision is that true and how to use it?

A variety of supplements are sold, there is no good evidence any of them help. 

> Also what are the things that cause lose of eye sight so I can avoid it does masturbation for example?

Practice good contact lens hygiene, always wear eye protection where appropriate, make sure you don't develop / control systemic diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes... masturbation doesn't matter"

 * 11 other business cards in last 11 years split between Chase and Amex, most recently CIC (06/2019) and the WN Performance (10/2019)
 
1. How much spend can you put on a new card(s) in 3 months? **$5-7k** including Plastiq but no other MS

1. Are you open to applying for business cards? **Yes**
 
1. How many new cards are you interested in getting? **1-2 every couple of months**

I'm a low-volume churner currently 4/24 but will be dropping to 3/24 in December as my Amex Plat falls off. I want to MDD the CSR/CSP (my current CSR will be 4 in 10/2020), but considering getting another card and then waiting until December so I can go from 4/24 --> 6/24.

**My specific questions are:**

1. Is the Hilton Aspire a reasonable personal card to get for high-value redemptions in the destinations above (if not, what else?), and is it worth/safe waiting for several months between PCing my CSR in Oct/Nov to MDDing in Dec/Jan?

2. After MDDing I will be above 5/24 until 01/2022. Should I hold off in case Chase starts approving sole prop business cards again, or do people think that's not going to happen anytime soon? I'm past 2 years and otherwise could start churning CIP#1, #2, etc. again."

AskDocs,"Are you having any acute vision changes or pain in your eyes? Unless you are, it's unlikely your eye pressure is elevated enough to cause permanent vision loss within a week. (If you are, you should see an ophthalmologist immediately, at your nearest academic ED if need be.) You should make an appointment with an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam as directed. Mildly elevated eye pressures can be seen in a variety of conditions and may warrant treatment to prevent long-term damage but are generally not acutely dangerous.

It sounds like whoever examined your eyes may have been using a direct ophthalmoscope, which is commonly taught to a variety of healthcare providers (e.g. advanced practice providers or primary care physicians), but rarely used by optometrists or ophthalmologists. It's a bit strange for her to have used one unless she didn't feel safe dilating you, which may have been the case if she thought you had elevated eye pressures and narrow angles. Even then, it's weird to use one at all, much less with what sounds like such poor technique. The examiner should always use their right eye to look into the patient's right eye (or left for left) to avoid the exact ""kissing"" scenario you describe.

As far as the other bizarre and/or inappropriate behavior you describe, it may be worth calling the vision clinic first to formally complain about the experience you had. They should also be able to give you more information about whoever it is you saw. If you want to file a complaint with a centralized accrediting/review body you will need to know what their credentials are."
AskDocs,"The sclera, or the wall of your eye, has a natural bluish-grey tint to it. It's possible for this to be more pronounced if it's thin for some reason (e.g. connective tissue disease), but yours is more likely just normal human variation. Only way to be sure is by seeing an ophthalmologist, though."

AskDocs,"I haven't removed any of your other comments.

I hope you get the procedure you want. I think you will have better success if you're able to open a dialogue with your doctor about what your understanding of the procedure is, what the risks are, and why you're confident you won't change your mind (you can't actually waive your right to sue, so any promises to that effect are meaningless). My argument, and I suspect that of most of your doctors, is not ""you don't know better"" and acting as though it is will not help your case."
AskDocs,"If that's what you think informed consent is or what I said, you're just proving my point.

The way you lash out at the large number of physicians who have replied in this thread trying to help you just because they did not say exactly what you wanted to hear is inappropriate and will not be tolerated. You're welcome to take your anger out at me but we will remove any comments baselessly insulting other physicians in our community."
AskDocs,"Plenty of physicians do turn down patients for cosmetic surgery. Patient selection is very important and it's a difficult skill that takes years to develop to learn how to figure out what the patient wants and to provide appropriate counseling. You can't build a career with great outcomes unless you screen out the patients who would not do well with surgery. For example, someone who just wants larger breast implants without any regard for how much they can realistically accommodate. Or someone who wants facial surgery but doesn't understand the nuances of how complicated the anatomy is and what actually is or isn't possible. 

We just don't hear about it because it doesn't have the same gender connotations to refuse to do elective cosmetic surgery as it does to refuse to perform elective sterilization. Add in a dose of ""well you'd let me if I was older"" and it's hard not to feel patronized.

Medically, sterilization is also just a much bigger deal than cosmetic surgery. It's more invasive, higher risk, and irreversible."
AskDocs,"OP has stated elsewhere in the thread that she doesn't need ""maturity"" and ""understanding"" and shows a poor conception of the risks of sterilization vs carrying a child to term. I'm not sure even if you wanted to that she would have demonstrated informed consent in the office."
AskDocs,"The physicians who are willing to do such sterilizations may very well have specialized legal templating for this but for most providers who are not doing this in high volume, standard boilerplate consent forms would not be sufficient to protect you."
AskDocs,"There are so many effective reversible contraceptive options available that it's very difficult legally to defend yourself if a patient regrets it later (which the evidence shows a significant portion do) and comes back to sue you. Even assuming you took on all the effort of meticulously documenting your conversation with the patient in a way that would hold up in court (which is harder than it sounds given that we don't generally also have law degrees), if doesn't even matter what the evidence is if a jury will find a young, heartbroken woman more sympathetic in a civil trial.

I'm not an OB/GYN and I'm sympathetic towards patients who aren't able to get the care they want, but I don't blame my colleagues one bit for not wanting to touch these kinds of issues with a ten foot pole."

Obviously it would be best if you could see an ophthalmologist in person for a detailed evaluation under the microscope, but it would be reasonable to try some preservative-free artificial tears (eg Refresh Plus) 4-6x/day for a couple days to see if it helps at all.

AskDocs,"I'm going to echo everything that /u/seeing_red415 said. It's an excellent description of the standard of care in retinal surgeries, and it would have been more likely malpractice if your original surgeon had done nothing to save whatever vision you had left.

If the goal now is comfort and cosmesis, you still have a couple options depending on how much vision you have left in that sick, right eye. If you are totally blind (no light perception), you can pursue evisceration or enucleation for a blind, painful eye. You would then get a prosthetic eye to match your good eye, and in many cases even have enough eye movement left where it looks totally natural. Prosthetics these days are true works of art and very high quality. Any asymmetry with the eyelids could also likely be fixed with some simple oculoplastic surgery.

If you do have some vision left, you're going to be hard pressed to find a surgeon willing to take it out. Even bare light perception can be very important later in life, for instance in helping maintain your circadian rhythm and prevent delirium, which has proven harms to mortality. However, there are medications you can use (such as atropine and steroids) that can help with any discomfort you may still be having. Additionally, you can still pursue shell prostheses that sit over the eye and can result in similarly excellent cosmetic outcomes.

I'm sorry that you have had such a tough time with your eyes. But there are definitely still options left on the table to get the goals *you* want to achieve. Your best bet is to find another ophthalmologist to give you a full evaluation, and refer you to an oculoplastics surgeon as necessary."

The attorney was held liable for legal malpractice even though an attorney-client relationship had never been established."
medicine,"If I recall correctly, that particular lawsuit about the curbside was a physician at a tertiary center who was called from a community hospital to ask whether a patient should be transferred / sent in for direct admission. The court's opinion in that ruling explicitly stated that they were *NOT* making physicians legally responsible for curbsides, but that in that specific case the physician should have understood that their advice would play a huge role in the care of the patient and that they were negligent in their duties as a result."

AskDocs,"She's a trooper! Antibiotic eye drops are just to prevent a possible infection from setting in until her cornea heals, which it should very quickly (within 1-3 days; if you've ever bitten your tongue, you know these mucosal injuries heal quick!).

I'd recommend getting some over the counter lubricating eye drops (eg Systane, Refresh) and using them 4 times a day for at least a month or so after you're done with the eyedrops. This will help reduce the risk of recurrent erosions, which is when the cornea spontaneously scratches itself again because it didn't heal well, more common after a dirty injury like a toenail."
AskDocs,"It's impossible to rule out an eye injury without an examination, but she sounds fine. Even small corneal abrasions are usually quite painful and I would not expect your daughter to be ""waking around like herself otherwise.""

AskDocs,"Hordeolum, chalazion, stye--different textbooks will tell you different ways to distinguish them but frankly it doesn't matter. They're all on a spectrum of benign eyelid inflammatory disease.

If it's been there for six months and it's not acutely inflamed (red, painful, etc) then it almost certainly will not be going away on its own. You would need a small procedure to remove it, which can oftentimes be done in an office or a minor surgery suite (not a full OR). Be advised they can still always come back."
AskDocs,"Again, I'm not sure what you think the utility is ""to document the lack of treatment."" I am always documenting all the things I am not doing when I write my notes with the things I *do* want to do. Do you seriously think it would hold up in court if a patient sued me and said, ""my doctor didn't do X"" and I go, ""I did, I just didn't write about it!""

Asking for further information or a referral for a second opinion as /u/H_is_for_Human suggests are both reasonable options. I am always happy to give and receive second opinions; it makes my patients more confident in my care and makes me a better doctor. Ultimately, if you still feel like you and your doctor don't get along, you should find a new doctor.

Medical malpractice suits are rarely filed by the people actually wronged and rarely justified by the people actually filing them. They require a high burden of proof, including evidence of substandard care and actual injury caused, and are frankly not a good mechanism for checking otherwise implicit gender or racial biases. If you feel like your doctor is biased against you, I do not recommend sticking with them hoping for an injurious outcome so that you can have your day in court."
AskDocs,"Yes, although I would say it's rarely worthwhile given the cost and risks of the procedure (such as poor cosmesis, recurrence, infection, etc).

You can talk to a dermatologist about your options.

Worth noting that diseases like neurofibromatosis can mimic a diffuse eruption of seb k's so if you truly do have a lot it's worth evaluation by a dermatologist regardless."

AskDocs,"The biopsy report just shows chronic inflammation, which could be from a number of causes. Usually if there were an infection one would expect to find some evidence of the causative organism on the pathology report, although it's possible it was missed in the sample provided. If there were a frank abscess I would also expect an incision and drainage although it's possible your surgeon wants to try systemic antibiotics first since it's in a cosmetically sensitive location.

The facial nerve runs superficially in the region around your temple and it can be technically challenging to operate in that area for that reason. There are techniques you can use to avoid it but nothing in medicine is 100% and the risk is always there. I can't speak for whether your surgeon feels the area is low risk based on his examination or whether he feels supremely confident in his ability to perform the operation."
AskDocs,"> The point is that you're letting them know that they are accountable for how they treat you.

That *is* the equivalent of saying ""I'll see you in court."" It's a great way to get substandard, cover your ass care. Frankly, it's also not reasonable--documenting what I plan on doing is also documenting what I plan on not doing, and I would not want to waste time and energy dealing with unreasonable demands from difficult patients like this.

Frankly at some point if you find a place that will accept him and the family says no, you have to tell them they're going to foot the bill for any alternatives.

No way his insurance is going to pay for a several months long ICU stay."
AskDocs,"Could be anything. Impossible to tell without a detailed history, exam, and review of all of your imaging (including repeat imaging in the future). You need to follow up with the doctor who actually knows you."
AskDocs,"A history of trauma with obvious signs of inflammation associated with **fever** and **pain with passive movement** are all incredibly concerning for a septic arthritis. The time frame of injury two days ago also fits. It's possible his doctor thought it was just a superficial infection, but I can't tell without examining him. 

What antibiotic is he taking? I'm not a pediatrician or an orthopedic surgeon, but I'm honestly surprised the joint wasn't aspirated or an orthopedic surgeon wasn't involved already. Without a sample of the joint it's impossible to know if any infection is even susceptible to what he's on, and he may need stronger IV antibiotics. Hold off on the Tylenol or NSAIDs and if he spikes a fever again, absolutely take him to the emergency room immediately. Cool compresses for comfort.

When I treat adults with septic joints, it's oftentimes an emergency that requires drainage and washout in an operating room and weeks of IV antibiotics. I frankly don't have the experience treating this in kids, and I hope someone more knowledgeable in our community can chime in, but your history has so many red flags I'd have a very low threshold of having him emergently evaluated tonight."

AskDocs,"There are too many unknowns here to answer your questions in any level of detail. However it sounds like he is off sedation, pressors, and out of the ICU, which are all excellent developments. I would expect him to require therapy after discharge, quite possibly a short stay at a skilled nursing facility to get some strength back. If your family feels like they can provide the level of care he needs to recover at home (which is often 24/7, at least in the short term), you can have a conversation with his doctors about whether you could do the physical therapy he likely needs at home.

Whether he can go back to work depends on any sequelae from his multiple organ failure. I would not be surprised if he makes a full recovery, but I would equally not be surprised if this takes several months. The other question is why he developed pneumonia and septic shock at such a young age; you'll need to address any underlying issues (e.g. obesity) to minimize his risk of all of this happening again. You'll need regular follow up with his primary care doctor and possibly several other specialists for this."

AskDocs,Removed. Rule 6.
AskDocs,"There is a theoretical risk that if you move your eye as the laser is firing, it could hit some other part of your retina instead. In the worst case scenario, if it hit your fovea, you could lose your vision. 

This is similar to how there's a risk every time you're chopping something in the kitchen of accidentally missing the food and stabbing your eye out instead. It could happen, but it would be a freak accident.

If you're still too scared, don't do it. The risk of a detachment is something you'll have to accept. No doctor wants to do an elective procedure on a patient who doesn't want it."
AskDocs,Agree. Fever and right lower quadrant pain; ER is appropriate here to rule out appendicitis.
AskDocs,"Laser retinopexy is not a surgery. It is performed at a slit lamp much like the one you sat at for an examination. No anesthesia is used beyond the standard numbing eye drops. They use a special contact lens to focus the laser and then establish a barricade around the hole. You will have to stay still for this and look in the directions they need you to look.

Many people have incidentally discovered atrophic or operculated retinal holes. These are asymptomatic, but the concern is that a hole in the retina can allow fluid to eventually seep through it and get underneath the retina, causing a detachment. This can cause irreversible damage to your vision. At least in the US, retinal holes are usually monitored with strict return precautions provided to the patient. However, there is no strong consensus, and if there is a surrounding cuff of fluid or evidence of traction around the hole, that places you at increased risk, and laser treatment would absolutely be indicated. Other factors like high myopia or lattice degeneration may further indicate weak retina and increase your risk of further damage.

I think you are right that they've probably been there for years. It is unlikely that they will cause you problems, especially in the near future. But laser is generally a very low-risk and well-tolerated procedure, and if they're offering it then it can only mean they feel that the benefits outweigh the risks. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you agree. Though, I don't really understand the logic of how being more anxious about your eyes makes you less likely to treat them."

AskDocs,"Papilledema is, by definition, caused by idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. I doubt your friend has gotten brain imaging or a lumbar puncture, so it would be incorrect of the optometrist to call it as such.

Elevation of the optic nerve head (ONH) can be caused by increased pressure around the brain (e.g. from IIH or a brain tumor) , but this is less likely if it was only in one eye (it's the same brain for both, after all). Also unlikely in the absence of headaches or other neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms. It could also be ONH drusen (largely harmless) or even examiner error, as normal ONH tilting or fullness can sometimes mimic optic nerve head swelling.

I'm a little horrified at the thought of any optometrist doing a surgical procedure. Your friends needs a repeat evaluation by an ophthalmologist and likely an OCT RNFL, which is a high-tech photograph that can definitively assess ONH edema, if there is any.

The good news is if it is papilledema then IIH is generally very treatable and not vision threatening. Your friend will have to work on losing weight, though."

Untreated acute anterior uveitis (AAU) can commonly lead to synechiae, glaucoma, macular edema, and other irreversible, potentially vision-threatening consequences.

Contact lenses also distort the shape of your cornea, making it impossible to obtain accurate measurements for laser vision correction. Generally, you should plan to avoid all contact lens use for a month prior to any refractive procedure."

[Picture to illustrate](https://i.imgur.com/VDnsHcv.png); the yellow distance is the same but the red is uneven.

One concern I might have is whether one eyeball is further out forward than the other, which is fairly easy to judge grossly by [just looking from above or below](https://www.aao.org/image.axd?id=feec927a-5fd4-4634-af6d-39031ed94995&t=635754962882170000). This can affect lid positioning. If so, a workup for thyroid disease would be reasonable. There are more things any ophthalmologist or, preferably, oculoplastics specialist would be able to look for on an exam to check for other potentially treatable or vision-threatening causes, but I suspect this is most likely benign. If so, you could have cosmetic surgery with an oculoplastic surgeon to fix this, but it would not be covered by insurance."
AskDocs,"/u/westlax34 made it clear there's a ton of variability and you asked specifically what he/she would do. That your doctor (you know, someone who actually examined you and knows you well) disagrees does not mean she ""super fucked up"". 

If there was a right answer, we'd all do it."
AskDocs,"I've actually never met a surgeon or physician who does twilight anesthesia in-office. (Small procedures with anxiolytics and/or local anesthetic, sure.) I know many dentists get some anesthesia training, and I'm sure there are some doctors that would, but as an MD it always struck me as unnecessarily risky. There's a long list of potential complications from anesthesia, and I'd rather have an anesthesia colleague there to help me if, God forbid, I needed it."
AskDocs,"If OP feels like they could tolerate an exam in office, I would still prefer having it done by a colorectal surgeon. If they get it done with an OB/GYN or CNM first they'd likely just need another one with the surgeon later. An EUA isn't necessarily common but certainly within the scope of practice for colorectal. I don't know the billing details personally, but I'd think they'd be able to figure it out."
AskDocs,"Exams under anesthesia are usually performed in operating rooms. Friends and family would not be allowed, but there would be plenty of nurses and other personnel constantly present."
medicine,Literally you can't be more hypotonic
AskDocs,"The concern with an inguinal hernia is that it could become incarcerated, which means the bowel gets stuck and can start to die. This would be a medical emergency. Otherwise, it's not recommended to do things that increase your intra-abdominal pressure (like lifting heavy weights), as this can worsen the hernia, but he should be fine to wait until his next appointment if it's not actively causing problems."
AskDocs,"It's not uncommon for people to flush asymmetrically from alcohol. It's interesting that yours appears to correlate as such, but it's nothing to be concerned about."
TooAfraidToAsk,"Any code situation is always controlled chaos. There are packed rooms of people with lines out the door and in the hallway, passing back and forth needles and meds. Not only is it ethically questionable, it's logistically impossible for any non-essential personnel to be present. If you are full code in the hospital, you will never be with your loved ones in your final moments. 

You don't need to be religious to be full code well past the point of reason, compassion, or medical futility. And a patient refusing blood is no different than the patient in heart failure who doesn't watch what they eat or take their meds, or the diabetic who doesn't check their sugar or keep up with their insulin, who are far more common and drain far more resources out of the system. Health illiteracy comes in all religions and demographics. 

If you take a second to look past your anti-religion crusade, I'm sure you will find lots of friends and family who think and feel the same way my patient did."
AskDocs,Talking to multiple specialists instead of one primary care doctor is probably part of the problem
AskDocs,"Yeah, chances are pretty good your doctor just didn't have time to have a conversation with you about her weight, and that most of her patient panel is overweight or obese so that she's stopped considering it for otherwise healthy patients.

It doesn't hurt to call her back and ask, but you likely already know all the things you need to do anyways: lose weight, eat healthy, exercise, etc."
TooAfraidToAsk,"She wanted treatment, she just didn't want blood. We would have been happy to discharge her. Hospitals are horrible places to die."
TooAfraidToAsk,"Did she understand she was going to die? Yeah, I think so.

Did she understand that CPR is a traumatic and usually unsuccessful endeavor? I think in general we spend quite a bit of time explaining to patients at the end of their lives why staying ""full code"" is a bad idea, but ultimately it's their right to prefer to pass traumatically rather than peacefully. Many patients incorrectly believe that that's the only way we ""do everything"" and that not being full code somehow means giving up. I explain to these patients that CPR does not reverse their underlying disease, and that we're realistically looking at a best case ""successful"" scenario of extending their lifespan by a couple days to weeks while they remain ventilator-dependent in an ICU, possibly with severe anoxic brain damage. I frequently offer them the alternative of getting better pain relief, eating or drinking whatever they want, or even letting them go home to pass, surrounded by loved ones and on their terms. At the end of the day, I don't think she was unique, religious beliefs or otherwise, in not understanding what that really means.

We had to evacuate the family out of the room when she went pulseless, but we did take the time to clean her up and remove the line we had drilled into her leg before we let them come back in to grieve.

[This article](https://secipe.org/wordpress03/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NEW-ENGLAND.pdf), aptly titled, ""Will You Forgive Me for Saving You?"" describes how providers often feel better than I ever could. (Edit for non-paywall version.)"
churning,I assume you mean you can use the same business card to generate two self-referral links for the MDD?
TooAfraidToAsk,"A patient I had during intern year (first year of being a doctor after medical school) was a Jehovah's witness with recurrent GI bleeding. She refused blood transfusion and remained full code to the end, even though she understood it would kill her. I would round on her every morning with her hemoglobin steadily trending down. It got to the high 3's (normal being >12, with transfusions indicated at 7) before her heart finally gave out. We performed CPR for a solid 20 minutes before calling time of death. I still remember her ribs crunching under my palms as I literally squished bloody stool out through her mouth."

Ophthalmology,"Determining NS vs cortical vs other types is objective and fairly straightforward. You should be able to teach yourself this with some reading and/or YouTube videos.

Grading is more subjective. Being internally consistent is helpful as an MD to monitor for progression over time, but otherwise it's mostly a matter of experience and ""feel""."

AskDocs,"Immunosuppression can also suppress the cytokine reaction that creates a fever. In such a case, you should be concerned because you are feeling symptoms of systemic infection while immunosuppressed, not because you have a ""low grade fever"" which, again, is not a thing."
AskDocs,Greater than. A temp of 100.4 is still not a fever.
AskDocs,T > 100.4 = fever. Full stop. You are not an exception. Low grade fever is not a (medically significant) thing.

AskDocs,"Pretty sure colobomas are, by definition, congenital. This is just a surgical iris, possibly in the setting of aphakia (unclear if they have an artificial lens, but it's unlikely in an adolescent's NLP eye)."
AskDocs,Not at all.
AskDocs,"Many cardiovascular procedures have different approaches to hemostasis compared to, say, your traditional laparoscopic abdominal surgeries. A heparin drip is a continuous infusion of short-acting anticoagulation that can be easily turned up or down peri- and intra-operatively. It requires frequent blood draws, nursing supervision, and constant IV access, and it is not pharmacokinetically comparable to an outpatient anticoagulation regimen."
AskDocs,"Conjunctivitis refers to any kind of inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the skin covering the eyeball and the underside of the lid. It can be viral, bacterial, allergic, vernal, chemical, etc. The list goes on."
AskDocs,"Your symptoms are classic for viral conjunctivitis, which is typically due to adenovirus. Your symptoms can last anywhere from 1-2 weeks, and they are typically associated with other upper respiratory or flu-like symptoms and start in one eye before spreading to the other.

You can use artificial tears, chilled in the fridge, four times a day in both eyes for comfort. Antibiotic drops will not help for a viral infection. You will have to wait for your body to run its course. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes because this is incredibly contagious. Occasionally, viral conjunctivitis can be complicated by [subepithelial infiltrates](https://eyeworld-websupport911.netdna-ssl.com/images/New_Articles/2017/01/24_b.jpg) or the formation of [pseudomembranes](https://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/content/pedsinreview/31/5/196/F17.large.jpg) which would require seeing an ophthalmologist to treat or remove."
AskDocs,Steroid eye drops can be used in specific circumstances but have a theoretical risk of prolonging the infection (in addition to potential side effects like glaucoma and cataract) and are most definitely *not* routinely indicated for viral conjunctivitis.
AskDocs,"Really bad styes/chalazions can look like this and are rarely dangerous, but you need to be evaluated for preseptal cellulitis which is rare but requires systemic (oral) antibiotics to treat."
AskDocs,"> What causes these post-accutane effects to start after you're not even taking the drug? Why are more doctors not taking this seriously and telling you that the side effects can happen not just during, but also after you stop it?

These questions as asked by OP have been sufficiently answered. Accutane is a common medication that many people are on, including some people with other unrelated health issues. This is not a place to discuss anecdotes about those, and this thread is now locked. If you have your own personal health question, please create your own thread."
AskDocs,"You need to be seen by an ophthalmologist. Could be an abrasion, infection, or inflammation (uveitis), among other things, all of which require treatment."
Residency,"If you're losing your landmarks, mark them. You can use anything from the rounded end of a withdrawn ballpoint pen to an actual surgical marking pen.

Residency,"> I wouldn’t condemn an entire department on the actions of a single individual once. That’s just as judgmental as the PD was being.

Yeah, because judging a program by its program director is totally equivalent to throwing away someone's potential career without a second thought because they had the audacity to get coffee, and then apparently still obsessing over it years later.

> Its funny that he ruined his chances over a pastry and didn't even realize it. EDIT: regarding the downvoted, you realize I’m not the program director, right? Just reporting the story. Way to kill the messenger.

With the way you're defending and minimizing this absurd behavior, you absolutely deserve the downvotes. There's nothing ""funny"" about how malignant you and your program obviously are."

Yes. That is what I mean by ""An ED workup would not miss it.""
