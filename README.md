# Reddit-Moderation-Data-Science

A data science project examining the involvement level of Reddit moderators within their communities. The research is focused on three subreddits: r/Politics, r/Games, r/AskDocs.
The project uses a Python Reddit API Wrapper to crawl through Reddit, NLTK for language processing, and matplotlib for plotting graphs.
